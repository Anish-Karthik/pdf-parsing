  "passage": "\tIt is very common when a child is born for family and friends to comment on the features of the baby\u2014mom\u2019s nose, dad\u2019s chin, or grandpa\u2019s ears. They will speculate about eye color, hair color, and height. As the child grows up, maybe he or she has an outgoing personality like grandma, or dad\u2019s sense of humor. These traits are no accident. Every person has expressed traits, like physical appearance, and inherent traits like personality or health. These traits come from genes passed down by the parents. A child receives one set from each parent, and depending on the combinations of dominant and recessive genes, these traits will manifest themselves in different ways, sometimes immediately and sometimes later on in life.\n\tDominant meat that particular trait will be manifested by the person, and only one parent is needed. Recessive genes need two genes, one from each parent, in order to be expressed. For example, brown hair is a dominant gene, and red hair is recessive. Usually, the child will have brown hair, unless both parents carry a recessive red hair gene. The concept of inherited dominant and recessive traits WETC first discovered in 1854 by Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk. In his experiments using pea plants, he was able to trace how traits from parent plants were passed on to new plants. This discovery of how some traits were passed on randomly and some traits followed statistical probabilities of appearance directly countered previous beliefs that all traits were a result of the parents [ralts blended together equally.\n\tMendel\u2019s research led to the discovery of different kinds of dominance in genes. In addition to complete dominance, when only the dominant trait is visible, there is incomplete dominance, which occurs when traits merge together to form a completely new trait. When a red flower and a white flower are cross-pollinated to make a pink flower. If the red flower and white flower result in a white flower with red splotches, it is codominance. In both of these cases, though, neither parent could have recessive genes. Looking at physical traits is the most obvious way to study the results of combining dominant and recessive genes, but a more important application would be determining the health factors inherited from parents. that produce too much or too little of something in the body. People can be unaffected, meaning they do not carry the gene. Affected means a person inherited two copies of the defective gene and displays the disorder. Or a person can be a carrier with one defective gene that is not displayed because of other dominant genes. Some examples of genetic disorders linked to recessive genes are cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Tay Sachs disease. Multifactoral diseases are caused by a combination of genes and environmental factors: heart disease, most cancers, diabetes, alcoholism, obesity, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Chromosomal disorders like Down syndrome result from an excess or deficiency of a gene.\n\tModern science and DNA testing can reveal a lot about genetics and genetic disorders. The ability to test embryos for genetic disorders and diseases is causing many ethical dilemmas for doctors and parents. Couples, in most cases ones who struggle with pregnancy, have the option to test embryos for specific disorders, and depending on the results, they have to determine if they are willing to live with the risks of following through with the pregnancy. In some cases, parents may decide they are willing to face whatever challenges they may face. In other situations, if the disorder is known to be very serious and have a high mortality rate, the parents may decide not to follow through with the pregnancy.\n\tThe science of genetics is a complex one. People can look in a mirror and see mom\u2019s eyes, dad\u2019s hair, and Great Aunt Lucy\u2019s blue eyes, or hear the same laugh as their siblings or have a cousin\u2019s similar lack of coordination. But they can\u2019t see what is on the inside, and with environmental factors having more impact now than ever before, the research that is being done could improve a lot of lives and prevent many diseases.",
