  "passage": "\tEvery second Sunday in March at 2:00 a.m., 48 states in the United States and 72 countries around the world move their clocks from 1:59 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. to begin daylight saving time (DST). DST didn\u2019t always \n\t popular in the last century and a half. Most people believe Benjamin Franklin invented DST. In 1784, he wrote a letter to the Journal of Paris, which he was surprised to wake up at 6 a.m. and find the sun up before noon. The letter was considered a joke, and another hundred years or so went by before the idea was brought up again by George Vernon Hudson of New Zealand and a British builder, William Willet. The first suggestion was to turn the clock forward two hours in October and back two hours in April. New Zealand being in thesouthern hemisphere would move the clock opposite of the United States. Later, in 1905, Willet suggested a slower change, moving 20 minutes at a time over four Sundays. Both ideas were rejected.\n\t[1] It wasn\u2019t until World War I, when the Germans instituted \u201cwar time\u201d to make better use of daylight hours and conserve enerey, that other countries also moved the clocks ahead one hour. Thirty-one countries followed their lead and stopped when the war ended. [2]  President Warren G. Harding hated DST and tried an experiment in 1922 where private business didn\u2019t have to use DST, even though the government and Washington, DC, did. [4] The result was disastrous. [5] In 1930, Joseph Stalin forced the former Soviet Union to move the clocks ahead one hour, and the country forgot to change them back for 61 years.\n\tAfter the war, some countries and states kept DST. creatine chaos and confusion. One story states that in 1960 passengers on a bus route from West Virginia to Ohio had to change their watches seven times! So Congress passed the Uniform Time Act of 1966, stating that even though states were not required to use DST, if they did, all states would follow the same guidelines. In 1986, President Reagan moved the start of DST to the first Sunday in April, and later the Energy Policy Act of 2005 would move it to precisely 2:00 a.m., the second Sunday of March, ending 2:00 a.m., the second Sunday of November.\n\tStudies began in the 1970s to determine whether using DST actually saved energy. Twenty-five percent of energy goes to electricity, powering lights and small appliances in homes and businesses. An increase in daylight hours would reduce this energy use. It also suggests a reduction in traffic accidents during rush hour, increases in health and moods due to more outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight, less nighttime crime, and a rise in sales for sporting and recreational businesses.\n\tThere are just as many arguments against DST. The results of the study in 1975 showed only a 1 percent decrease in energy use, and today, society sreliance on technology powered by electricity is significantly higher. Other studies suggest that a person\u2019s body never really adjusts to the change, and it causes interruptions of the sleep cycles, making them feel tired and affecting the immune system. Farmers argue there is no need to change the clocks. They have always adjusted their schedules to increase use of daylight, so business should be able to start earlier instead of relying on a clock change. With no real proof that one way is better than another way, the debate about DST will most likely continue on for some time.",
