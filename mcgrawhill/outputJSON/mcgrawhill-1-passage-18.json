  "passage": "\tThe relentless growth of the internet continues to produce phenomena\u2014from email and instant messaging to social networking and real-time communications\u2014that are transforming society. The increasingly significant field of Web science aims to discover and analyze how websites, trends, and virtual interactions and transactions occur and how they impact society positively or negatively. It involves observation of the micro interactions of people on the Web, such as instant-messaging conversations, as well as the macro effects of the internet on the world stage, such as YouTube stardom. The benefits and dangers of internet use often depend on who is using it and how.\n\tFor example, Facebook currently has over a billion and a half profiles globally. Families and friends, hundreds or thousands of miles apart, can share news and stay connected instantly. Businesses can reach out to and interact with customers on a more personal level. Communities can increase publicity and attendance to their events, and awareness movements can spread rapidly throughout regions, states, and even countries. But even Facebook has a darker side.\n\tCyberbullying is rampant through social media. Over 43 percent of children have experienced some form of cyberbullying through harassment, threats, ridicule, and intimidation. This can result in low self-esteem, fear, depression, and even suicide. Facebook and other social media sites should have intense monitoring of content to prevent posts from inciting violence, hate speech, and other illegal activity.\n\tAnother serious problem the internet faces is cyberstalking. Cyberstalking is using email, social media, technology, and websites to stalk, follow, or obsess over a person. Sometimes it is a person from a former relationship or a mentally ill person who is delusional and believes this person is a friend. Identity theft is the most serious form of cyberstalking.\n\tIdentity theft involves a criminal who steals the identity of a person, usually through personal information the person has shared on the internet. The criminal can then steal money, open new bank accounts, forge documents, and cause havoc in the victim\u2019s life.\n\tPreventing and stopping cybercrime is very difficult. There is usually very little evidence, and sometimes a person does not know he or she is a victim. Web science studies are showing that the best way to prevent problems is to make Web pages and Web interactions more trustworthy.\n\tBest practices based on recent findings include visiting pages created by sources such as universities, as well as those that encourage the use of reputable services such as PayPal. Using internet security programs to protect yourself and your computer can help against spyware, viruses, and hacking. Don\u2019t share passwords, and keep social media settings as private as possible. No one is 100 percent protected, but a few simple steps can protect people from most cybercrimes, and reporting any suspicious activity can help save other possible victims.",
