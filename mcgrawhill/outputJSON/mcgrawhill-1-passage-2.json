  "passage": "\tA mysterious ailment called colony collapse disorder (CCD) has wiped out large numbers of honeybees. CCD is when all of the worker bees who produce the honey leave the hive. Only the queen, a few nurse bees that care for the immature bees, and a food supply are left. With no drone bees to create more food and build up the hive, it eventually dies. The exact cause of the problem is as yet unknown, but there are a number of theories. Recent studies have revealed that there is likely more than one factor affecting the bees, rather than a single cause.\n\tMany experts believe that the colonies may have been hit by viral or fungal infections. Bees\u2019 number-one stressor is the varroa mite, a parasite that depletes the blood supply of drone bees and bee larvae. This weakens the developing bees and shortens their life expectancy. It also causes deformities in the bees, like missing legs or wings.\n\tOther possible causes of bee attrition include malnutrition from a lack of nutrients and food sources, poison by fertilizers and pesticides, habitat loss due to deforestation and increased agriculture, and a loss of genetic diversity as a result of commercial breeding. Climate change also impacts bee health because it disrupts plant growth cycles. If the plants and the bees are not synced, the bees may try to pollinate at the wrong times, when the plants have not produced enough pollen.\n\tThe loss of these bees is both an environmental and economic disaster. Bees pollinate one-third of all food produced, which includes 70 different types of crops. Six thousand tons of honey is produced every year. If bee colonies die off, all of these crops would have to be pollinated by hand, which would cost millions of dollars in labor. This means that many of the common foods that we consume, including fruits and almonds, could become so rare that they would become luxuries rather than diet staples. Bees are also responsible for the pollination of numerous plants in the wild. This symbiotic relationship means that if the bees disappear permanently, so will the wild plants that depend on them to reproduce, leading to a collapse of many ecosystems.",
