  "passage": "\tThe moon has always held a fascination for civilizations throughout history. It is beautiful and mysterious. It impacts our ocean\u2019s tides and feeds superstitions and stories. It also continues to puzzle scientists with no clear answers about its origins.\n\tThe moon is thought to have formed more than 4 billion years ago, not long after Earth. There are many theories on how the moon came into existence. One of the earliest theories is the Fission theory that the moon came from the Earth\u2019s crust, specifically the Pacific Ocean basin. However, had this been accurate, fossil evidence from the ocean would be consistent with fossil evidence on the moon. No such evidence exists.\n\tAnother theory is the Capture theory, in which the moon was created elsewhere in the solar system and was captured into orbit by Earth\u2019s gravity. But an event of such perfect timing and force is highly improbable. The Condensation theory, that the moon and Earth were created individually from the same substance that forms the rest of the solar system, was also discarded. The moon lacks an iron core that would have been formed by this genesis.\n\tThe most widely accepted explanation is that a low-speed impact occurred between Earth and another object that was likely as big as Mars, which forced tons of material into orbit. All that material then slowly coalesced to form the moon. However, if the moon was created from this type of impact, much of the debris would have come from the other object resulting in a very different chemical composition from Earth. This would also explain the synchronous rotation, meaning the same side of the moon always faces Earth.\n\tHowever, the far side of the moon may have faced Earth at one time. We know from the age of the craters on the moon\u2019s surface that it was hit repeatedly during the creation of the solar system. If the moon had always faced the same way, it would have more craters on one side. The newest theory of the moon\u2019s conception holds another possible explanation for this.\n\t\u201cSynestia\u201d is the newest theory that it was a high-speed impact with a Mars-sized object that vaporized some of the outer layers of the Earth, blowing the debris into a ring around the planet. The high speed of the collision increased the rotation speed, and the debris coalesced into an individual body\u2014the moon. Over billions of years, the gravitational pull of the Earth and moon on each other caused the rotations to slow down until they synchronized.",
