  "passage": "\tAfter graduating high school, many young adults are looking for part-time jobs to help pay for college, living expenses, transportation, and social events. However, they need jobs with flexible schedules as their availability could change from semester to semester, they might already have another job. The current job market offers many more options for self-employment than ever before. In fact, 10 to 15 percent of the working age population  extra income. The Digital Marketplace, including apps and internet-based businesses, makes up 67 percent of self-employment opportunities. Self- employment is appealing to all ages, education levels, incomes, and occupational interests. You work the hours you want; advancement is dependent on your own motivation; and you can do something you are truly interested in.\n\t[1] One of the most popular and fastest growing careers ale driving for a rideshare app like Uber or Lyft. [2] Some of the positive reasons people start driving are extra income, working only when they want to, feeling useful, keeping busy, and meeting new people. [3] The start-up costs to begin driving for Uber or Lyft are very low. [4] Anyone can sign up to begin driving; would-be drivers just need to pass a vehicle inspection because they are required to have a vehicle model newer than 2002 in most states, a background check, and personal car insurance. [5] Before deciding which company to work for, it is important to explore the differences in the hiring process, potential income, the paymentprocess, and both employee and customer satisfaction.\n\tHere are some things to consider about Uber: you can start working independently much sooner than with Lyft. Once you pass the inspections and backeround check, the training sessions are compieted online, and you areready to go. Lyft pairs new drivers up with veteran drivers for hands-on training throughout the hiring process. It might take longer, but Lyft drivers have reported feeling much more confident and knowledgeable when they begin driving on their own. Drivers reported that Uber is not as accessible as an employer. Communications are mostly in the form of automated email responses, and passenger ratings significantly influence your employment. Lyft also has a ratings system, but passengers go through training when they create a Lyft account, to explain to them how it works, and drivers receive feedback from Lyft based on those ratings. Uber does not.\tHowever, you are not going to choose your future employer by its training style or ratings system, but by how much money you can make. Uber drivers tend to be busier than Lyft drivers, but some of this is due to rate cuts for passengers. Uber also takes a 20 percent commission from your rides. Lyft has an incentive-based commission system: the more hours you drive, the lower your commission. Regardless of which company you drive for, you also have to pay out of pocket for gas, insurance, tolls, income taxes, and general vehicle maintenance. Here is an example from an Uber driver who drove 12 hours in one shift. He made $180, which seems like a decent wage of $15 an hour, but once he subtracted Uber\u2019s commission and a percentage for his out-of-pocket expenses, his final profit was only $4.54 per hour.\n\tBoth companies have \u201cprime-time hours\u201d and \u201csurge\u201d hours where rates increase, and drivers can earn more. But the downside is those hours can be late at night, and passengers might need rides in areas of questionable safety. Full-time drivers say they have had the most success working for both companies, depending on what hours they drive and in what location. Rideshare apps offer a unique opportunity to earn extra income on youreown terms, but as a primary source of income, you need to carefully consider all the options of each company and how much time you have available for driving before you make your final decision.",
