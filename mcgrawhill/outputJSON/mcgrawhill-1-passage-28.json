And in the end, they always get caught. In real life, the biggest art heist in United States history is still unsolved, and the criminals had none of those high-tech gadgets. ar] On the night of March 18, 1990, two men dressed as police officers demanded entry into the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, Massachusetts, \n\t the security guards with arrest, they handcuffed him, and made off with 13 works of art valued at over $600 million. rT\tIsabella Stewart was born in New York in 1840, and she married Jack Gardner, a member of an upper-class New England family, and moved to Boston, Massachusetts. After the death of their son, at the advice of her physician, the Gardners traveled around the world to ease her depression. During these travels, Isabella begin to seriously purchase art, and her collection included paintings, drawings, tapestries, rare books, sculptures, and jewelry. She befriended artists, authors, poets, and other creative thinkers. When they returned home from their travels, she would host dinner parties, academic talks, and other events to share her interests and art. Eventually, it became obvious that their home was overflowing with their trezsures andthey dreamed of creating a museum to share it with the public.\n\tThe death of her husband in 1898 pushed Isabella to make their dream of a museum a reality. She chose an area of Boston known as the Fenway, famous for its natural light and a nearby park system, and designed the building to reflect a fifteenth-century Italian villa from one of her trips to Venice, Italy. Isabella carefully planned each room\u2014every detail, from the carpets to the wallpaper\u2014and a location for each of her treasures. Upon her death in 1924, Isabella\u2019s will bequeathed $1 million for the continuation of her museum, with the condition that nothing would be moved and no new work added, not even to replace the the famous stolen artwork.\n\tIt might not seem like 13 pieces out of a collection of 2,500 should be so noteworthy, but they are historically significant and irreplaceable in the art world. Rembrandt\u2019s painting Christ in the Storm on the Sea of Galilee and Manet\u2019s Chez Tortoni were cut right out of its, frames as they hung on the walls. The loss of Vermeer\u2019s The Concert was extremely devastating to the museum because only 34 paintings by the artist are known to exist worldwide. Yet the thieves also took artifacts that were lesser known, like a bronze-plated eagle and a Shang dynasty vase. Over a span of 81 minutes, the thieves appropriated this odd assortment of items and passed by numerous others that were more valuable, with no discernible reason.\n\t[1] Current museum security director, Anthony Amore, can now watch the original rooms and the 65,000 square feet of the museum\u2019s recent addition on banks of security monitors, ensuring there will be no repeat of the previous theft. [2] A $5 million reward is still being offered for the safe recovery of the stolen works, but in spite of hundreds of tips from the public and several theories by the FBI, no trace has ever appeared. [3] Staff and visitors alike are haunted by the empty frames where the stolen works used to be. [4] Today, the museunrs flourishing programs, concerts, classes, special exhibits, and artist-in-residence are still shadowed by the unsolved mystery, and a reward of millions waits unclaimed.",
