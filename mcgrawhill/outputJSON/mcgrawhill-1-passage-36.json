The Aymara are one of 11 tribes related to South America, specifically in Peru and Bolivia, that predate the Incan Empire. The Aymara has slowly migrated toward the larger, more established cities, bringing their heritage and traditions with them. \u00d1atitas, which translates to something like \u201clittle pug-nosed ones,\u201d refers to the skulls, which are the guests of honor during this special festival.\n\t[1] These skulls live in places of honor in the homes of the Aymara people. [2] Most families have small shrines or beautifully decorated cases for them. [3] These skulls could be from deceased relatives, passed down from generation to generation as family heirlooms, or dug up from an unknown grave and given a new life as a \u00f1atita. [4] The Aymara believe humans have seven souls. [5] When a person dies, six of those souls go to heaven or the after life and one stays inside the skull. [6] The skulls, which are associated with fertility, luck, and protection, then grant blessings to the home and family of their caretaker. [7] But not every skull makes a good \u00f1atita. [8] If the personalities of the skull and its owner conflict, the person could be cursed by the skull with illness, misfortune, or financial loss. [9] When a skull is purchased from a grave robber instead of being dug up honorably, this can happen.\n\tThe festival begins in the home, where skulls are brought out in hats,  decorated for the occasion. Fresh flowers and cocoa leaves are offered to each skull, but to make it happy, it is essential to have cigarettes, alcohol, and live music. When the skulls are happy, the family may ask them for blessings. These could include protection, cures for illness, helping a child with homework, or financial success. Even police officers have \u00f1atitas and swear they help solve cases and catch murderers. Once the skulls are prepared, they are paraded through the streets to the central church in La Paz for a blessing.\n\tThe relationship between the Catholic Church and the Aymara people is a \n\t one. When the Spanish conquest began in 1535, the indigenous people were harshly punished for practicing their ancient traditions, including having \u00f1atitas. For two centuries, they practiced their beliefs in secret from the Church, until a rebellion in 1780. For a while, the Church refusing to bless the skulls but did not actively punish practitioners, until 2003, when the refusal resulted in rocks being thrown at the church, smashing the windows. Although the Church still will not perform a mass, they will bless the skulls and sprinkle holy water on them as they parade through the aisles. Once the ceremony is complete, the skulls are escorted to the large central cemetery and displayed for the rest of the day.\n\tAn average of 10,000 people join the festivities at the cemetery, bringing their own skulls or asking blessings of the skulls that are present year after year. Some skulls are famous, showing up year after year and bringing good fortune to their owners and anyone who asks for protection and a blessing. And of course, what  year, hundreds of people sing. dance, and celebrate long into the night to honor the \u00f1atitas as full-fledged participants in their lives, not as macabre reminders of a dead person. The Day of the Skulls Aled not about the person who died, but about the spirit of the skull that lives on. In Bolivia, \u201cthe dead are only as dead as you allow them to be.\u201d",
