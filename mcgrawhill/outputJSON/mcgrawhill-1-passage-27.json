  "passage": "\tIn the last decade, the United States has seen some of its largest and most.costliest storms in the last 100 years. With advanced technology enabling meteorologists to predict storms days and even weeks in advance, terms like \u201csuperstorm\u201d and \u201cbombogenesis\u201d are on the tips of everyone\u2019s tongues and sending communities into a frenzy of preparations. Superstorm Sandy in 2012 and Hurricane Harvey in 2011 are just two examples of large superstorms that ravaged areas of the United States. \n\tThe difference between a hurricane (a tropical cyclone) and a winter cyclone is the energy source. Hurricanes draw their energy from warm water. Winter cyclones that are not the same as blizzards, draw their power from temperature contrasts in the atmosphere. This allows the storms to grow dramatically. Superstorm Sandy started as a hurricane that turned north and collided with a winter cyclone. The contrasting temperatures drew the storm inland and stretched it out. It was almost 1,000 miles across! It also had the lowest recorded barometric pressure of any Atlantic storm in record history. A full moon duringNew York.\n\tAlthough Sandy\u2019s size and impact was devastating, it was only the second most expensive and deadly storm to hit the United States in the last decade. Hurricane Harvey had over $100 billion in damages due to 51 inches of rain and devastating flooding, but the second fewest deaths of the five major hurricanes since 2010. Hurricane Matthew had the highest death toll due to its track across the small islands of the Caribbean that had little protection. It wasn\u2019t the storm surge or the rainfall alone that made it so devastating. Hovering over warm ocean waters, Hurricane Matthew sustained a category 5 rating. Flash floods and mudslides came down the mountains toward many small villages that lacked solid construction, and demolished them. Isolated locations meant a lack of clean water, food, medical support, and shelter for victims. Flooding leads to water contamination as drainage and sewers run into lakes, streams, and reservoirs. Harmful bacteria thrive in damp conditions and cause mold growth in homes and buildings, which leads to respiratory problems. After Hurricane Katrina, 105,000 condemned homes, built in the 1950s, were\n\t leaching into the air, ground, and water of the surrounding areas. The long-range consequences of this are still not known. Delayed medical care in New York after Sandy led to 125 heart attacks, 35 strokes, and 70 deaths that might have been prevented.\n\tThis increase in severe large-scale storms raises a lot of questions about what causes them and why they are increasing in frequency. Global warming is a significant contributor according to climate scientists from Texas Tech who were interviewed in 2012 by National Public Radio (NPR). Climate change is contributing to the exacerbation of catastrophic weather events. Warmer ocean temperatures lead to more evaporation and a 5 to 10 percent increase in rainfall during precipitation events.  extended heat waves. Glaciers are melting, and rising sea levels mean more damaging storm surges and more flooding. The United States has 4,514 miles of coastline with 20 percent at or below sea level making it very vulnerable.\n\tSuperstorms are not going away, so it is more important than ever that information about climate change and Ats impact on weather is understood at a global level. Areas that have previously suffered significant losses need better protection and better preparations for future storms. Scientists, urban planners, and infrastructure specialists need to work together to ensure that people, homes, and businesses can survive the wrath of future storms and continue to thrive in their communities.",
