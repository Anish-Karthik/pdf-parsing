  "passage": "\tThe image of women during wartime is primarily based on their presence on the home front, not on the front lines. Women were banned from enlistment in the US military until well into the twentieth century, and until January 2013 were not permitted to serve in active combat.\n\tYet some women did not allow that restriction to stop them from fighting on either the Union or Confederate side during the Civil War, even though both armies also prohibited their enlistment. Because it was illegal for them to fight on the battlefield, these brave and unconventional women embedded themselves in the army camps by concealing their gender. They changed their names and disguised themselves as men in order to become soldiers. Once enlisted and in the camps, it was crucial to act and talk like a man to avert discovery.\n\tBut with a loose-fitting uniform, and with so many boy soldiers barely in their teens, it is not hard to see how a woman could live undetected for months or years. Their identities were often only discovered by accident\u2014for example, one account tells of a woman who was discovered when she fell into a river and had to be rescued\u2014or because of injury or death. A lucky few survived the war without ever being discovered. They served for years alongside their male counterparts and fought in many battles.\n\tSome estimate the number of women who served in the Civil War to be nearly 1,000. Because they passed as men, it is impossible to know the exact number with any certainty. Passage 8B According to contemporary accounts, it was well known, both to male soldiers and to ordinary citizens, that women fought in the Union and Confederate armies. Stories by eyewitnesses and even published reports were common. In the case of one woman, Mary Owens, her triumphant return home after a serious injury was widely celebrated in her town and featured in press coverage. She had enlisted in the Union army with her husband, William Evans, and carried on fighting after he had been killed in battle. She served for 18 months under the alias John Evans until treatment for her wounds revealed her gender. Stories of these women were often fodder for gossip in the army camps.\n\tDecades after the war, many families included the details of these women\u2019s service in their obituaries. Articles about the soldier-women continued to be written. Unfortunately, the focus, and fascination, of the writers and the reading public appears not to have been with their heroic acts on the field, or with what life was like for them in the camps, but only with the fact that these women had enlisted and whether or not they emerged from the war unscathed.\n\tIn addition, the US government maintained information, during and after the war, of the existence of the soldier-women as part of the country\u2019s military archives. The US Records and Pension Office kept complete service reports for a number of soldier-women, including discharge papers that list the cause for their expulsion as the fact that their gender was discovered. In later years, some of these women even received a military pension for their service.\n\tDespite such popular recognition, the Union and Confederate armies\u2014and later the US government\u2014officially denied that any woman lived among the rank and file or that any woman had ever fought in the war. And because their stories were told in the general sphere and didn\u2019t find their way into school textbooks, the Civil War soldier-women are unknown to most Americans today.",
