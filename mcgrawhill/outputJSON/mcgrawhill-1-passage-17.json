  "passage": "\tThe current energy crisis over crude oil threatens the political and social stability of all countries, regardless of their economic development. Ever- increasing demand\u2014coal, oil, and natural gas (fossil fuels) account for 80 percent of the world\u2019s current energy\u2014will eventually outstrip global supply. Estimates of how much crude oil there is vary, but some believe, at the current global consumption rate, that there are only 30 years of resources left. As supplies diminish, this will lead to conflict, and possibly even war, between the nations that supply the crude oil and those that require the product.\n\tCrude oil is crucial to daily life, but few nations today have access to large, easily recoverable deposits. This creates increased political tensions between nation-states. Four regions\u2014Africa, Russia, the Caspian Basin, and the Persian Gulf\u2014account for 80 percent of the world\u2019s oil supply, and over half the world\u2019s natural gas reserves are in only three countries: Russia, Iran, and Qatar. All of these regions struggle with political instability and tense relationships with other nations in the world. Therefore, in order to avoid dependence on hostile nations, the oil and gas industries in countries like Canada and the United States have turned to unconventional methods of extracting crude oil from less accessible areas, such as tar sands and shale rock deposits.\n\tThese methods, while necessary, are nascent and controversial. For example, some experts believe that more studies need to be done on the effects of the hydrofracking process to remove oil and natural gas from shale rock by drilling tunnels and injecting high pressure mixtures into the ground to force the gas out. The effects of using this method are controversial as recent studies show that it might cause earthquakes and pollute local water supplies. In some cases, unconventional methods of oil and gas extraction are prohibitively expensive.\n\tAs a result of these issues, many national governments and major oil companies are working on developing other sources of energy, such as solar panels, wind farms, hydroelectric plants, and fuel from corn. However, many of these methods are still in their infancy. The technology has not evolved to the point where the energy derived is dependable. For example, low rainfall means that the output from hydroelectric plants drops precipitously. Power utilities still need plants that run on fossil fuels to make up the shortfall. Another renewable option is nuclear power. Although it has been in use by some countries for several decades, many nations feel that the risks are too great. A nuclear meltdown would be unpredictable, deadly, and catastrophic \u2014be it caused by a natural disaster or human failure.\n\tAdditionally, the energy crisis serves to further marginalize the poor, who will find themselves priced out of transportation options, and maybe even food. As the standard of living improves in countries like India, Indonesia, China, and Brazil, more people move to big cities, where the jobs are, or they travel there from their homes in nearby towns. With more employment, they are then able to save money to purchase automobiles and the gasoline to fuel them. However, high-priced gasoline means that they lose access to the educational and job opportunities that were previously available to them. The few public transportation options that exist are poorly maintained, further inhibiting their progress. Even in developed nations, costly gasoline has a profoundly detrimental effect on underprivileged communities.\n\tFood availability will be a problem because logistics and manufacturing are predominantly dependent on crude oil. The food that is grown or produced must be transported from its point of origin out to markets around the world. The more expensive gasoline is, the more costly the food will be, because producers will need to increase the price of the final product in order to cover their cost of operations. Even staples like bread, milk, and rice will become more expensive, threatening the ability of the world\u2019s poor to put food on the table.\n\tFor now, the world economy depends on the production and dissemination of crude oil. Therefore, with global demand for oil accelerating, the best way to avoid dangerous conflicts is to get more fuel-efficient cars on the roads, reduce our dependence on driving by offering incentives for walking and bicycling, and build more effective public transportation systems.",
