It\u2019s \u201ctwo thousand miles all the way,\u201d according to Nat King Cole in his famous song, \u201cGet Your Kicks on Route 66.\u201d The song may not offer much information about what to do when you get there, but it is a good starting place if you want to take a drive and experience the history of Americana.  Chicago, Illinois, all the way to Los Angeles, California (or Santa Monica depending on how true to the route you stay). It began life as part of the National Old Trails Highway, and once it was paved, in 1926, ir became more than just a road. It became a lifeline to small towns across the Mid and Southwest regions of the United States, and now it is one of the most popular road trips to take in America, with dozens of attractions to see in every state.\n\tNot ablyone has two to three weeks or more to experience the entire trip, but for a taste of the true Route 66, the 401 miles crossing through Arizona will more than satisfy the yearnings of any wanderer. Arizona is home to some of the longest stretches of the original highway still in existence. thinkThis is mostly due to the \u201cAngel of the Mother Road\u201d a man named Angel Delgadillo born and raised right on the side of the original Route 66 highway in Seligman, Arizona. The \u201cMother Road\u201d is a reference to John Steinbeck\u2019s novel, The Grapes of Wrath, and Delgadillo think it fits Route 66, which gave birth to numerous small towns and businesses. He witnessed some of the most important events Oll our history travel right in front of his barbershop, like families escaping the Dust Bowl and abandoning farms during the Great Depression, and supplies being brought West during World War II.\n\tIt all changed on September 22, 1978, when Interstate 40 opened, bypassing Seligman and dozens of other small towns in favor of high-speed travel between large cities and major attractions. Slowly businesses died down or closed. Towns beecan to empty out. Families had no money coming in to support them.Delgadillo decided to take a stand to save his home and the historic entity that is Route 66. In 1987, he convinced many business owners to create the Historic Route 66 Association of Arizona. They were able to preserve a 159- mile stretch of the road, with only small pieces no longer accessible, and slowly start to resurrect that nostalgic feeling that visitors were coming to experience. Seligman, Arizona, is just one town that brings in tourists from all over the world.\tArizona is also the home of several other unique attractions along Route",
