  "passage": "\tExcerpt from \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d by Charlotte Perkins Gilman If a physician of high standing, and one\u2019s own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression\u2014a slight hysterical tendency\u2014what is one to do?\n\tMy brother is also a physician and also of high standing, and he says the same thing.\n\tSo I take phosphates or phosphites\u2014whichever it is\u2014and tonics and journeys and air and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to \u201cwork\u201d until I am well again.\n\tPersonally, I disagree with their ideas. Personally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change, would do me good.\n\tBut what is one to do? I did write for a while in spite of them; but it does exhaust me a good deal \u2014having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.\n\tI sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more society and stimulus\u2014but John says the very worst thing I can do is to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad.\n\tSo I will let it alone and talk about the house. The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people.\n\tThere is a delicious garden! I never saw such a garden\u2014large and shady, full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors with seats under them.\n\tThere were greenhouses too, but they are all broken now. There was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and coheirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.\n\tThat spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid, but I don\u2019t care\u2014there is something strange about the house\u2014I can feel it.\n\tI even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt was a draught, and shut the window.\n\tI get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I\u2019m sure I never used to be so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.\n\tBut John says if I feel so, I shall neglect proper self-control; so I take pains to control myself\u2014before him, at least, and that makes me very tired.\n\tI don\u2019t like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned chintz hangings! But John would not hear of it.\n\tHe said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near room for him if he took another.\n\tHe is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special direction.\n\tI have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.\n\tHe said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect rest and all the air I could get. \u201cYour exercise depends on your strength, my dear,\u201d said he, \u201cand your food somewhat on your appetite; but air you can absorb all the time.\u201d So we took the nursery at the top of the house.\n\tIt is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look all ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then playroom and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred for little children, and there are rings and things in the walls.\n\tThe paint and paper look as if a boys\u2019 school had used it. It is stripped off \u2014the paper\u2014in great patches all around the head of my bed, about as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of the room low down. I never saw a worse paper in my life.\n\tOne of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin. It is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough to constantly irritate and provoke study, and when you follow the lame uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide\u2014plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard of contradictions.\n\tThe color is repellent, almost revolting; a smoldering unclean yellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.\n\tIt is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulfur tint in others. No wonder the children hated it! I should hate it myself if I had to live in this room long.\n\tThere comes John, and I must put this away\u2014he hates to have me write a word.",
