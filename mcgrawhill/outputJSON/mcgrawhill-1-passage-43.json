Here, chickens are truly free range, living wherever they alc\t eating everything from garbage to cat food. Some are fed by tourists and others forage in nature. Some locals blames Hurricane Iwa in 1982 and others, a subsequent hurricane (10 years later) for blowing open the coops of domestic birds and allowing them to escape and breed with the wild Red Junglefowl. The Audubon Society reports an increase in the number of birds after every hurricane. However it happened, chickens are running amok on the island and causing all kinds of problems.\n\tThe word dangerous is not the first one that comes to mind when thinking about chickens, but the rampant presents of the bird gives the residents of Kauai more than a little grief when the crowing starts at 2:00 a.m. and goes on for hours. The birds destroy gardens and landscaping, scratching at roots and small plants; eating fruits, vegetables, and seeds; and costing people money in lost produce or revenue and repair costs. They poop anywhere and everywhere, and bird poop contains bacteria that can cause many illnesses; it can even kill native bird species. These chickens are often more aggressive than native birds and can kill them. They also cause traffic jams and accidents when flocking in the middle of the roads. But the chickens do eat a lot of bugs, including the Hawaiian stinging centipede. Tourists love them, and chicken souvenirs bring in a lot of money to the local economy.\n\t[1] Chickens are not native to Kauai in the sense that they have always been on the island. [2] The Red Junglefowl is a semi-domesticated cousin of Southeast Asian pheasants that WFC brought to the islands of Hawaii when the Polynesians arrived. [3] DNA tests of random chickens found around the island match some of the DNA from these fossils. [4] Anthropologists are using the chicken DNA to help track Polynesian expansion across the globe, because history shows they never traveled without their chickens.\n\tOrnithologists are studying Kauai\u2019s birds because these chickens have evolved on the island for hundreds of years, with no outside DNA tainting the birds. Feralization traditionally occurs just the opposite of domestication,However, interbreeding between the Red Junglefowl and the domestic chicken vue having some interesting results. Chickens are taking on some of the more ancient traits, like smaller size, colorful appearances, and the instinct to brood on a nest, but keeping some of the more domestic traits, including smaller brain sizes.\n\tOne reason Kauai is having difficulty controlling its chicken population is a lack of natural predators on the island. When European and American settlers came to the islands, they brought the mongoose, which ultimately wiped out almost the entire chicken population of Hawaii except on Kauai and Niihau. Still, on the island of Oahu, people trap and kill dozens of feral chickens every year. The Humane Society used to provide traps, but the demand was so high, it referred people to the internet for the traps. For a $5 donation, it will pick up the birds. Birds that are healthy are offered to people to eat as a sustainable food source. The issue has been discussed many times at local and state government levels, but it still causes much conflict. In Kauai, the chicken is ultimately representative of a history and culture that defines the island and its inhabitants, and no one is anxious to see themdisappear.",
