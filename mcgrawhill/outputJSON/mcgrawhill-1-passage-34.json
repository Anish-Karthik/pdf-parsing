  "passage": "\tThink about Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Twilight, and James Bond. They are all blockbuster movies originally based on books. Tom Clancy\u2019s character Jack Ryan appearing in movies for over three decades beginning with The Hunt for Red October and more recently Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. Audiences today, according to surveys, are much more likely to go see a movie that is \u201cbased on\u201d somethinge\u2014a novel, series, or true-life event. The process of turning a book into a movie is a long and very unpredictable one. There are many things to think about before a script is written from a book or a book is even selected. Most times it is not even the authors who tries to get their books turned into films.\n\t[1] The first step in turning a book into film is to pick the right book. [2] Not all books make good films. [3] The plot might not offer enough suspense to keep an audience interested or the scope of the novel might be too complex to Dut in (oO a two-hour movie. [4] Dut in (oObooks or plots with unusual twists are chosen for movies, which isn\u2019t to say other books would not make good TV movies or series. [6] No matter what, there ail always risks when going to make \u201cthe pitch.\u201d [7] The pitch is when a proposal to make a book into a movie is sent out to producers, hoping someone will be interested. [8] Most successful writers already have contacts through their literary agents or publishing companies, but it is important to have a successful introduction to the movie world when making the pitch.\n\tOnce a director decides he or she likes the concept of the book, they agree to options. The option is payment to the author for considering the book. The option is not a guarantee the book will be made into a movie, but it is a contract with very certain guidelines for what happens if the movie is made and releaseabout everything from what the author earns all the way through how many free tickets the author gets to the movie premier. It could include a deadline for consideration, whether the author will be included in the credits, and whether the author will get to review the script. The final step for a book to be turned into a movie is writing the script. The author is rarely involved in this part because it is a totally different kind of writing, and it is important to find theright director for the vision of the film and give artistic freedom to interpret the book in the best way possible for the movie.\n\tStephen King has had more books turned into films than any other writer. When he enters into an option with a producer, he asks for a dollar; approvals over the screenwriter, director, and principal cast; and a share in whatever profits come in. King states in an interview that he has not always liked the film versions of his book, but directors who are persistent and edgy get his attention. Stanley Kubrick\u2019s The Shining \u201cwasn\u2019t what he imagined.\u201d The movie oversimplified in his opinion the emotional struggles of the characters, and he doesn\u2019t take credit for successes or failures because he doesn\u2019t make the movies.\n\t[1] Not all authors can distance themselves that way. [2] Stephanie Meyers, author of the Twilight series, struggles with criticism of her book because of the way things are portrayed in the movie, even though she had very little to do with writing the script. [3] Her success with Twilight has labeled her a fantasy writer, so no one is interested in reading her other, non- fantasy, books. [4] It\u2019s possible a bad movie can make the book look bador disappoint the audience when the only thing the book and movie have in common is the title. [5] Some books, like Gone with the Wind, The Godfather, The Shining, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter, have become some of the greatest movies of all time, and cultural icons whose popularity will never fade.",
