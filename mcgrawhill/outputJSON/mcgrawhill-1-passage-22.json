  "passage": "\tOne controversial interaction that the fashion industry has with the public is the issue of \u201cplus-size\u201d fashion\u2014from models to specialty boutiques\u2014which has both its champions and detractors.\n\tAdvocates for plus-size fashion marketing say that it is a positive step for an industry that has been corrupted by a preference for models who sometimes do not even weigh 100 pounds. So in a literal sense, fashion models have traditionally been nearly half the size of the average American woman. Supporters of plus-size fashion say that the fashion industry\u2014and by extension, the media\u2014bombards people with images of women that are unhealthy and not at all realistic. Therefore, plus-size clothes and models are a step in the right direction.\n\tHowever, others say that the term plus size in the fashion industry is a misnomer. Many times, the plus-size model is only a size 6, and even the largest model in the industry is still only about a size 10. Yet the average American woman is a size 14. So although the efforts of a number of high- profile designers to include \u201clarger\u201d models and bigger sizes in their recent collections are commendable, they are still not representative of reality.\n\tAll these opponents, however, are still missing the most important point\u2014 plus-size fashion marketing should not exist at all. The proliferation of plus- size fashion clothing, as well as plus-size women being championed as role models, will only result in the acceptance of obesity in our society.\n\tThis is tremendously damaging, as obesity rates in the United States are on a continuous upswing. The industry is responsible for how it markets products and images to society, and therefore should only show images of people who are fit and trim. Passage 22B The specter of eating disorders in the fashion industry is an ever-present issue. Experts estimate that many models at top agencies are as much as 20 percent underweight. The World Health Organization considers a body mass index (BMI) value of 16 to be severe thinness, but many models are well below that figure. The pressure to remain this thin is why some models resort to anorexia and bulimia, and this pressure often trickles down to women in general because of images in the media.\n\tIt is not hard to see why these disorders are pernicious\u2014and so often deadly. Model Ana Carolina Reston had a BMI of only 13 and weighed just 88 pounds at the time of her death at age 21 in 2006. That same year, model Isabelle Caro slipped into a coma after starving herself down to just 55 pounds.\n\tIn response to calls for more proactive measures, officials at some leading modeling events have implemented guidelines to encourage healthy body weights, such as not allowing models with a BMI lower than 18 to walk the runway.\n\tClearly, the question remains of whether modeling agencies and top design companies have the ethical responsibility to move away from the ultrathin appearance that characterizes the industry. However, it is not up to the industry to edit its message. It is up to the models\u2019 guardians to make sure they are eating properly, and up to parents of young women to help them have a healthy body image.",
