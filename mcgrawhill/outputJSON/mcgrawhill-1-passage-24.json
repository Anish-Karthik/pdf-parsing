Not for someone with a disability. A service dog is not a pet. Long before the term service dog was coined, dogs have been pets, hunters, protectors, and guides. \n\t Today, dogs have roles in the police force, the military, hospitals and nursing homes, and other public service fields, including serving individuals with a variety of disabilities.\n\tAccording to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, a service dog is defined as \u201cany guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability.\u201d Prior to the 1960s,most service dogs were guide (\u201cseeing-eye\u201d) dogs for blind people. In 1976, the National Education for Assistance Dogs Services began training and using dogs as hearing assistants for the deaf. In 1996, they began pairing service dogs with children diagnosed with autism, and in 2012, with people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. In fact, psychiatric disabilities are fourth, behind blindness, mobility impaired, and deafness, with the highest demands for service dogs.\n\tEveryone knows dogs are very smart. They can be trained to sniff for guns, explosives, and drugs. [hey can be trained to find survivors of natural disastersor dead bodies covered in rubble and wreckage. The training required for service dogs is very hard work for both the dog and the trainer. It can take 18 to 24 months to train a service dog, and over the lifetime, training and care can cost up to $24,000. These are some of the basic tasks a service dog might have to Suuimon retrieve objects, alert or Suuimon a person from another room, learn a special bark to use with a speaker phone in case of an emergency, signal owner for fire or burglar alarms, offer mobility assistance, and lead emergency help to an owner\u2019s location. Service dogs for psychiatric disabilities have more specialized training to guide a disoriented handler, providing tactile support during an anxiety attack, identify and alert handler to hallucinations, search a room, and interrupt or redirect a person engaged in trigger behaviors. Dogs can even be trained to signal \n\t owner about an oncoming seizure in an epileptic or when a diabetic person needs to take insulin.\n\t[1] Due to the intense training needed in a successful service dog, it is important to pick the right dog for the job. [2] \n\t the first week a puppy is born. [3] When picking the breed, a person should consider their lifestyle to determine what size, energy level, and maintenance level is appropriate for them. [4] The temperament of the puppy is also very important because it will not grow out of those qualities. [5] A service dog needs to be calm, focused, and confident. [6] It would not be good if the dog was easily scared or distracted. [7] A service dog should also be trainable and intelligent, but not a breed that gets bored easily because it will be doing the same activities every day.\n\tApproximately 500,000 service, therapy, and support dogs were reported working in the United States in 2016. There will always be a demand for high quality dogs and the dedicated, caring people who train them. But theyenable people with a variety of disabilities to lead safe, healthy, and productive lives that might otherwise be inaccessible.",
