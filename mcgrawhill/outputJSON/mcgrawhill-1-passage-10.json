  "passage": "\tIt has been clearly documented that crime levels in the United States have been falling for some time. In fact, crime levels today are at their lowest level since the 1960s. Adding positive news to these statistics is that many states are heeding the call for reforms in sentencing and corrections procedures. The goal of these reforms is not only to keep people out of prison but also to enhance the efficacy of the parole system, for example, by helping to provide adequate housing or employment to convicted felons. Even so, over half of inmates released will be arrested again within three years because of their inability to find a stable job and a place to live, their need for medical care, or a lack of practical education and training.\n\tIt is also well known that the jail population of the United States has grown to an alarming size of 2.3 million people in some form of incarceration or detention. Globally, the United States has the highest rate of incarceration at 670 per 100,000 people. Studies have shown that one of the reasons for this dramatic increase is the war on drugs, as a citizen can be arrested for the possession of minute amounts of an illegal substance, and prison sentences for drug offenses are disproportionately long. One in five inmates in federal prison is there for a nonviolent drug offense.\n\tThis increase has had the direst consequences in African American communities, where males are six times more likely to be incarcerated than white males. This statistic is also true of black women, whose incarceration rate is four times that of white females. Hispanic and Latino males are two times more likely to be incarcerated than white males. The loss of a central male figure in the household because of incarceration breaks up families and reduces income, raising the poverty level. Children of incarcerated parents are five times more likely to engage in risky or criminal behavior.\n\tThere is also an aging prison population in this nation because people are serving more time than those in past decades. More than 160,000 people are serving life sentences, with and without the possibility of parole. Another 44,000 are serving virtual life sentences, where the inmate is not expected to survive to be released. Each year of a prison life sentence that begins in a person\u2019s 30s costs an average of $1 million. Seventeen thousand prisoners are serving life sentences for nonviolent crimes.\n\tIt is evident that the current measures to substantially reduce the US jail population are a step in the right direction but are not enough. City and state officials must come together to brainstorm new solutions and put forward more reforms to decrease initial incarceration rates and reduce recidivism, lowering the overall prison population over time.",
