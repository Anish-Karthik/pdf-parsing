  "passage": "\tCentral Park, in New York City, is reterred to as \u201cThe Jewel of Manhattan\u201d and occupies a coveted 843 acres in the middle of one of the busiest cities in the United States. Its story began over 150 years ago. The New York State Legislature enacted a law appropriating 700 acres of space in the middle of the island ofManhattan to create America\u2019s first landscaped public park. The legislature\u2019s decision was based on the realization that a park would improve public health and bring the people of New York together as a community. Citizens would be more active and more social. Peed |\tIn 1858, a contest was held to determine the design of the park. Architects Frederick Law Olmstead and Calvert Vaux, who later designed many other famous New York public Parks, were the winners. Their design encompassed a variety of landscapes including waterways and a pond, strategically placed woodland areas, gently rolling paths, and even a sheep field where actual sheep grazed! \u2018Today these features contribute to the eniovment of many Central Parkactivities that residents and tourists enjoy. In addition to paths for walking, jogging, and bicycling, there are programs like Discovery Kits to explore the park, a place to play board games, Keeping It Green programs for maintaining and preserving the park, holiday events, concerts, and dog- friendly areas. But there are shadows on Central Park\u2019s past; histories that most park goers are not aware of.\n\t[1] When legislators decided to create Central Park, there was one thing in  way; a whole village of people. [2] This area was known as Seneca Village, a principal black settlement in New York City. [3] Very little is known about the people who lived there, but when the area was cleared for the park, it was home to an estimated 264 residents, black and Irish. [4] There were three known churches, two schools, and three cemeteries. [5] Even though residents were relocated, the cemeteries were never moved, and later excavations discovered.what might have been a former slave burial ground. [6] But these villagers were not the only residents displaced. [7] A total of 1,600 people in the area were relocated in order for the park to be constructed.\n\tAnother dark time for Central Park came after the Great Depression. With no funds to maintain the park, landscaping began to decay, and structures fell into disrepair. Citizens stopped using the park for socialization and exercise, and incrementally, illegal activities and violence flooded into the park space, giving it a negative reputation. The condition of the park deteriorated to the point where the City of New York abdicated responsibility for the park and stopped their eftorts to clean it up. Finally, in 1974, a management study was conducted, and action was taken to take back the park.\n\tFirst, a CEO of Park Operations was selected. This person would have complete control over decisions made to improve and maintain the park. Second, a Central Park Board of Guardians was created to involve private citizens in the use and development of the park. Campaigns took place in 1987, 1993, and 2008 to raise money and restore the park to its former glory. Thanks to these efforts, Central Park is once again the crown jewel it was meant to be: however, people should not forget the sacrifices and struggles that went into making the park what it is today.",
