The man, Walter Elias Disney, was born in Hermosa, Illinois, on December 5, 1901.  with his four siblings. He loved trains and as he got older would spend his summers working on the trains, selling snacks to travelers. At a young age, he was encouraged in his drawing by an aunt and a neighbor. He took photography and drawing in high school, but his family MOVES a lot for his father to find work, so school never really interested Disney.\n\tHe dropped out of high school at age 16 with the intention of joining the army during World War I. He was rejected due to his young age; instead, Disney traveled to France and volunteered for the Red Cross, driving an ambulance. A year later, in 1919, he returned to the United States and began looking for a job as a newspaper artist. His first professional job was for KC Film Advertising Company, doing hand-drawn cel animation, in which each frame is drawn by hand and then put together to be filmed at a high speed so the frames look seamless. Disney used this experience to open his own studio, producing short, animated cartoons called Laugh-o-crams, butdeclared bankruptcy in 1923. brother, they went to work for Iwerks Studio and soon produced the first Mickey Mouse cartoons. \u2018These were not as popular as Disney had hoped, but finally, when sound could be combined with the animation, he had a hit with Steamboat Willie, using his very own voice for Mickey Mouse from 1928 through 1947. In 1932, he won his first Academy Award for the short subject cartoon category, and then again for the next seven years. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the first full-length, animated feature film and received a total of eight Academy Awards. Overall, Disney still holds the record for most individual Oscar wins, with 33, and nominations, with 59.\n\t[1] During World War II, Disney struggled to keep his new Burbank, California, studio open amidst strikes by his employees. [2] He focused on compilations of short cartoons and made propaganda films for the United States. [3] Ac the beginningof the war, Disney did not want to taint the reputation of his studio with obviously propagandist works, but eventually his studio did produce anti-Nazi cartoons and other animated shorts using the character of Donald Duck. [4] Disney Studios produced over 400,000 feet of film for US military training, war support, and patriotic films. [5] This is equal to 68 hours of viewing time. [6]  encouraging citizens to pay their taxes to support the war.\n\tAfter the war was over, Walt Disney returned to feature-length animated films, and in the next decade, he produced six more movies: Cinderella, Treasure Island, Alice in Wonderland, Lady and the Tramp, Peter Pan, and 101 Dalmatians. His Burbank studio produced over 100 films. In addition to film production, Disney designed and  amusement park, Disneyland, in California in 1955. Although he passed away in 1966, his brother, Roy Disney, went on to carry out his brother\u2019s dream and opened Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, in 1971. Today, with Disney parks in countries around the world, movies, merchandise, television networks, and billions of dollars in revenue each year, it is easy to forget the legacy the man leaves behind as a groundbreaking hOlmmaker whose contributions changed animated film production forever.His own words\u2014\u201cdream, create, inspire\u201d\u2014are still used today, in every park, with all employees, to remind them what the true spirit of Disney is.",
