  "passage": "\tBeginning with George Washington, the United States has had 44 presidents. Donald Trump is considered our 45th president, but Grover Cleveland served two nonconsecutive terms, making the count 44. Each administration had pros and cons. Some were faced with war; some with the expansion of the nation; some with poverty, and many other crises. Others had more quietexperiences. Presidents like Lincoln and Kennedy left lasting legacies in the wake of their accomplishments and assassinations. But some presidents were not so impressive and memorable. In fact, despite current social media claims, the most-forgotten \u201cworst presidents ever\u201d were all elected prior to the 1950s. And one of the worst, least memorable Wield Warren G. Harding, the 29th was altendine 1921 to 1923.\n\tWarren G. Harding was born in 1865 and grew up in a small town in Ohio with an idyllic American childhood. His parents were doctors, and he had a brother and four sisters. He   a one-room school and played in the town band. At age 14, Harding enrolled at Ohio Central College and became the editor of the college newspaper and a powerful public speaker. After graduation, Harding took over a local newspaper, The Marion Daily Star, and turned it into a very prosperous business. During this time, he met and married a wealthy divorcee, Florence Kling de Wolfe, who encouraged him to enter into politics, more because of his public speaking abilities than any true interest or skills.\n\t[1] His political advancement was due mostly to favors for city bosses, and Harding failed to win the governorship of Ohio on 1910. [2] His bid for US Senate in 1914 was successful, but he was not a very active participant in legislature. [3] As a Republican, he supported business interests and higher tariffs, but even while presenting a strong position, he missed two-thirds of the votes he could have participated in. [4] He was an impressive speaker, had no major political enemies, and had the \u201cright\u201d stance on all the important issues; these qualities won him the presidential election in 1921.\n\tPresident Harding\u2019s administration was not known for hisaccomplishments, although there were a few, most notably establishing a budget for the federal government and calling the Washington Naval Disarmament Conference, as well as championing civil liberties for African Americans well before the Civil Rights movement came into existence. Other, less impressive feats included limiting immigration, ending spending controls that had been put in place during wartime, and creating tax cuts for higher incomes. However, Harding was not a very hands-on commander-in- chief and delegated most of the work to his Cabinet members. Three members, Herbert Hoover, Andrew Mellon, and Charles Evans Hughes, were extremely intelligent, capable men who accomplished many things during their time at the White House. Unfortunately, most of Harding\u2019s Cabinet, and later his time as president, was labeled with corruption.\n\tThe most well-known scandal was the Teapot Dome scandal in which one Cabinet member leased public lands to oil companies in return for personal loans. He was arrested and convicted of taking bribes. Another friend of Harding\u2019s was Charles Forbes, director of the Veterans\u2019 Bureau, who was caught selling government medical supplies for veterans on the black market. Two other staff members involved with the Veterans\u2019 Bureau committed suicide soon after the scandal was known to the public. But the president\u2019s own personal scandal did not come to light until after his death.\n\tPresident Harding died on August 2, 1923, of a heart attack. No autopsy was performed, and some people believe his wife may have poisoned him in order to avoid returning to the White House under the shame of being associated with criminal activities. Later it was discovered he\u2019d had an affair with a woman named Nan Britton while he was a senator, and DNA identification proved he was the father to her child. =r Today, these incidents may not seem so shocking and many presidents have faced similar situations and not been judged so harshly. His greatest downfall was his lack of commitment to the responsibilities of being president, that may have made him one of the \u201cworst presidents ever.\u201d",
