  "passage": "\tThe human body creates a lot of heat. In addition to that which we create by running or jumping, we constantly use energy on involuntary functions such as blinking or blood circulation. These types of processes must go on at all times in the body, without our control, even during sleep. But unlike reptiles, which use only outside sources to heat and cool their bodies, mammals maintain a consistent temperature. Therefore, heat must be controlled by a source from the outside environment or from our own bodily functions.\n\tThe part of your brain that tells the body it is overheating is called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a gland that helps regulate the body and maintain homeostasis. It causes a person to shiver when the body temperature drops or to sweat when the body temperature rises. The body performs at its optimum when it maintains a constant body temperature.\n\tThe cooling process is controlled by the circulatory system. The body disperses heat into the air by exhaling warm, humidified air and by evaporating sweat. The evaporation of sweat cools both the skin and the blood in the vessels beneath it. This blood then returns to your core, cooling your internal body temperature.\n\tThese processes work best when the ambient temperature is around 70 degrees. It begins to become less efficient when the temperature starts to match our core body temperature of 98 degrees. This can cause dehydration, leading to an inability to sweat due to hot, dry conditions. It also does not work as well when the humidity in the air rises, as the rate of evaporation slows down. That\u2019s when you begin to feel hot and uncomfortable.\n\tDangers of overheating range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms include dizziness, headaches, muscle weakness, red skin, and fatigue. More serious implications include heat stroke, nausea and vomiting, painful cramps, and eventually organ failure.",
