  "passage": "\tAdapted from Saki\u2019s \u201cThe Interlopers\u201d The two enemies stood glaring at one another for a long, silent moment. Each had a rifle in his hand, each had hate in his heart and murder uppermost in his mind. The chance had come to give full play to the passions of a lifetime. But a man who has been brought up under the code of a restraining civilization cannot easily nerve himself to shoot down his neighbor in cold blood and without a word spoken, except for an offence against his hearth and honor. And before the moment of hesitation had given way to action a deed of Nature\u2019s own violence overwhelmed them both. A fierce shriek of the storm had been answered by a splitting crash over their heads, and ere they could leap aside a mass of falling beech tree had thundered down on them. Ulrich von Gradwitz found himself stretched on the ground, one arm numb beneath him and the other held almost as helplessly in a tight tangle of forked branches, while both legs were pinned beneath the fallen mass. His heavy shooting-boots had saved his feet from being crushed to pieces, but if his fractures were not as serious as they might have been, at least it was evident that he could not move from his present position till someone came to release him. The descending twig had slashed the skin of his face, and he had to wink away some drops of blood from his eyelashes before he could take in a general view of the disaster. At his side, so near that under ordinary circumstances he could almost have touched him, lay Georg Znaeym, alive and struggling, but obviously as helplessly pinioned down as himself. All round them lay a thick- strewn wreckage of splintered branches and broken twigs.\n\tRelief at being alive and exasperation at his captive plight brought a strange medley of pious thank-offerings and sharp curses to Ulrich\u2019s lips. Georg, who was nearly blinded with the blood that trickled across his eyes, stopped his struggling for a moment to listen and then gave a short, snarling laugh.\n\t\u201cSo you\u2019re not killed, as you ought to be, but you\u2019re caught, anyway,\u201d he cried; \u201ccaught fast. Ho, what a jest, Ulrich von Gradwitz snared in his stolen forest. There\u2019s real justice for you!\u201d\n\tAnd he laughed again, mockingly and savagely. \u201cI\u2019m caught in my own forest land,\u201d retorted Ulrich. \u201cWhen my men come to release us, you will wish, perhaps, that you were in a better plight than caught poaching on a neighbor\u2019s land, shame on you.\u201d\n\tGeorg was silent for a moment; then he answered quietly: \u201cAre you sure that your men will find much to release? I have men, too, in the forest tonight, close behind me, and they will be here first and do the releasing. When they drag me out from under these cursed branches it won\u2019t need much clumsiness on their part to roll this mass of trunk right over on the top of you. Your men will find you dead under a fallen beech tree. For form\u2019s sake I shall send my condolences to your family.\u201d\n\t\u201cIt is a useful hint,\u201d said Ulrich fiercely. \u201cMy men had orders to follow in ten minutes time, seven of which must have gone by already, and when they get me out\u2014I will remember the hint. Only as you will have met your death poaching on my lands, I don\u2019t think I can decently send any message of condolence to your family.\u201d\n\t\u201cGood,\u201d snarled Georg, \u201cgood. We fight this quarrel out to the death, you and I and our foresters, with no cursed interlopers to come between us. Death and damnation to you, Ulrich von Gradwitz.\u201d\n\t\u201cThe same to you, Georg Znaeym, forest thief, game snatcher.\u201d Both men spoke with the bitterness of possible defeat before them, for each knew that it might be long before his men would seek him out or find him; it was a bare matter of chance which party would arrive first on the scene.\n\tBoth had now given up the useless struggle to free themselves from the mass of wood that held them down; Ulrich limited his endeavors to an effort to bring his one partially free arm near enough to his outer coat-pocket to draw out his wine-flask. Even when he had accomplished that operation, it was long before he could manage the unscrewing of the stopper or get any of the liquid down his throat. But what a Heaven-sent draught it seemed! It was an open winter, and little snow had fallen as yet; hence the captives suffered less from the cold than might have been the case at that season of the year. Nevertheless, the wine was warming and reviving to the wounded man, and he looked across with something like a throb of pity to where his enemy lay, just keeping the groans of pain and weariness from crossing his lips.\n\t\u201cCould you reach this flask if I threw it over to you?\u201d asked Ulrich suddenly; \u201cthere is good wine in it, and one may as well be as comfortable as one can. Let us drink, even if tonight one of us dies.\u201d\n\t\u201cNo, I can scarcely see anything; there is so much blood caked round my eyes,\u201d said Georg, \u201cand in any case I don\u2019t drink wine with an enemy.\u201d\n\tUlrich was silent for a few minutes, and lay listening to the weary screeching of the wind. An idea was slowly forming and growing in his brain, an idea that gained strength every time that he looked across at the man who was fighting so grimly against pain and exhaustion. In the pain and languor that Ulrich himself was feeling the old fierce hatred seemed to be dying down.\n\t\u201cNeighbor,\u201d he said presently, \u201cdo as you please if your men come first. It was a fair compact. But as for me, I\u2019ve changed my mind. If my men are the first to come you shall be the first to be helped, as though you were my guest. We have quarreled like devils all our lives over this stupid strip of forest, where the trees can\u2019t even stand upright in a breath of wind. Lying here tonight, thinking, I\u2019ve come to think we\u2019ve been rather fools. There are better things in life than getting the better of a boundary dispute. Neighbor, if you will help me to bury the old quarrel, I\u2014I will ask you to be my friend.\u201d",
