  "passage": "\tMore than 150 years passed from the signing of the Declaration of Independence to the establishment of the National Archives Building in 1934. During the interim, a deficit of proper, secure storage resulted in the loss of priceless information. Many documents were stolen or destroyed over the years. One such significant loss was the 1890 United States census records.\n\tThe 1890 census was unique in several ways. It was the first time an electrical tabulation system would be used to calculate results. It was also the first time each family would receive its own record and included inquiries regarding race, home ownership, primary language spoken, immigration, and naturalization. It also asked questions related to the Civil War.\n\tBut the 1890 census was also fraught with complaints and political intrigue. New York officials were accused of inflating numbers. A complaint by St. Paul, Minnesotan businessmen led to 19 indictments against Minneapolis businessmen for falsifying 1,100 names on their census counts. Further investigations were brought to a halt when a fire destroyed most of the 1890 census records in 1921. Had these records survived, we would have inimitable information on these issues, as well as on American industrialization, westward migration, veteran services, and other characteristics of the American population at that time.\n\tThe data would have been incredibly enlightening and useful in limitless applications\u2014to historians, political scientists, and so on\u2014but they are now completely lost to history. It is really quite remarkable that so many valuable records even exist today. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t until the twentieth century that the government became vigilant and proactive about the safety and preservation of historical records. Passage 4B The National Archives Building was approved by Congress and President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1934 for the preservation and care of documents and records of national significance. Previously, these records had been stored in a variety of basements, sheds, business, and storage facilities, with no security in place to protect documents from theft or environmental damage.\n\tUntil the end of the nineteenth century, there was little interest in creating this type of facility. But the fire that destroyed the Commerce Building in 1921 and resulted in the loss of the 1890 census records spurred many historians and archivists into action. In 1934, Congress created the National Historical Publications Commission to oversee the protection and preservation of documents that were not stored in the National Archives Building.\n\tOne of the tenets of democracy is that the government must answer to the people. The National Archives Building exists to provide a centralized system to the American people to access information that can hold the government accountable. The National Archives Building currently has over 40 facilities nationwide, including field archives, federal records centers, presidential libraries, the Federal Register, and the National Historical Publications and Records Commission. Its mission is \u201cto safeguard and preserve the records of our government, ensure that the people can discover, use, and learn from this documentary heritage, and ensure continuing access to the essential documentation of the rights of American citizens and the actions of their government.\u201d The Electronic Records Archive has the responsibility of protecting and storing information for a digital age. It provides instantaneous access to millions of documents, videos, graphs, and photos, but is still no replacement for preserving the original inspirational founding documents on display in our nation\u2019s capital.",
