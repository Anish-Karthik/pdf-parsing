  "passage": "\tMany forms of prejudice exist in society today. Not all forms of prejudice are obvious to the average person. \u201cBenevolent prejudice\u201d is a type of discrimination that often seems friendly or harmless. There are no outward signs of anger, fear, or violence, but it is still an unjustified or incorrect attitude toward a person based on his or her social group.\n\tAn example of benevolent racism is the assumption that black Americans are all athletic, musical, religious, or have strong family bonds. These qualities are positive, but the misconception that they apply to all black Americans is a form of prejudice. Another form of benevolent prejudice is related to society\u2019s attitude toward women. When people believe all women are weaker than men, are natural mothers, are more caring and compassionate, or should not work as hard as men at a job, they are being sexist.\n\tOne of the most insidious forms of prejudice is discrimination against the elderly, which often takes the form of older people being marginalized or patronized out of pity. People will often speak to the elderly in a slow, infantile manner, or they will assume that the senior citizen is a needy, nonproductive member of society. There are several forms of age-related bias, or ageism. The elderly are often seen as bungling and ineffectual, and are therefore treated differently, despite there being absolutely no proof of ineptitude.\n\tAgeism toward the elderly often manifests itself in the workplace. An older job applicant may be passed over for a younger one purely on the basis of age\u2014because the older person is viewed as less capable, not because of an actual lack of experience or skills. At the other end of the spectrum, a company may try to coerce a long-time employee to go into retirement before he or she is ready, in order to pay a new person less money to do the same job. It may be assumed that an older person would not want to adapt to new ideas or use a new technology, or that possible medical issues could impact job performance or attendance.\n\tThese issues are not mutually exclusive to older people. They could affect a person of any age. Because of benevolent ageism, many reliable, responsible senior citizens are losing jobs and being forced out of work.",
