  "passage": "\tFactory farming takes an enormous toll on our environment. There are many procedures involved in the large-scale manufacture of food that result in greenhouse gases and other pollutants entering the environment. Some procedures require the consumption of copious amounts of fossil fuels, such as the transportation and refrigeration of food products. The trucks, trains, and planes that carry food around the world are fueled by hundreds of thousands of gallons of gasoline. The electricity required to keep food refrigerated and preserved for human consumption requires the burning of coal or natural gas at power plants. Over 90 million tons of carbon dioxide are released into the atmosphere every year. Although many people are aware of the damaging effects of carbon dioxide, they do not realize that methane, a gas with 25 times more global warming potential than CO2, accounts for 37 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, making it an ominous concern.\n\tOther factors that detrimentally affect the environment include excessive use of freshwater for irrigation. An increase of pathogens like E. coli and salmonella occurs from fresh water sources that have been contaminated by manure and other animal byproducts. Run-off from fossil fuels used in farm equipment, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides poison these water supplies for drinking and kill off natural food sources and vegetation, impacting natural ecosystems.\n\tThe production of beef is more damaging to the environment than that of any other food we consume. Cattle account for 75 percent of farming-related greenhouse gas emissions compared to more environmentally efficient chickens and pigs, which produce only 10 percent of the emissions and provide three times more meat. Grazing is a primary concern. Raising large numbers of cattle requires the production of a vast amount of food for the animals. In North America, livestock consumes the least due to nutrient-rich feed at 165-662 pounds of food per animal annually.\n\tIf the cattle are free-range cattle, large areas of land are required for them to live on. In some developing countries, this has led to devastating deforestation and, subsequently, the loss of rare plants and animal species, particularly in tropical rain forests in Central and South America. In the United States, particularly in the Midwest and Rocky Mountains, overgrazing results in soil erosion and increases the danger of flooding and landslides.\n\tUnfortunately, beef consumption is growing rapidly. This is the result of simple supply and demand factors. Specifically, there are two main causes of demand that are spurring the production of more supply. First, the increase in the world population that has taken place since the advent of modern medicine means that there are more people to consume meat. The second factor is socioeconomic advancement. As citizens in developing nations become financially stable, they can afford to buy more meat.\n\tTherefore, the only way to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions is for people around the world to significantly cut down on the amount of beef they eat.",
