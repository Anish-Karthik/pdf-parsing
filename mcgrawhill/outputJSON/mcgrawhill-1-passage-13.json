  "passage": "\tThe assemblage of Egyptian antiquities in the British Museum in London is the world\u2019s largest and most comprehensive outside of Egypt. Founded in 1753, the original collections were comprised mostly of artifacts bequeathed to the museum by Sir Hans Sloane upon his death. By 1866, the museum housed approximately 10,000 objects.\n\tOne of the greatest periods of expansion for the collections took place in the early nineteenth century. Napoleon\u2019s forces had invaded the region, intending to make it a stepping-stone in the conquest of British India. However, the French forces were defeated in the Battle of the Nile. All of the Egyptian antiquities that had been acquired by the French were commandeered by the British army and offered to the British Museum as part of the treaty in 1803. Among the many works taken at that time was the legendary Rosetta Stone, which made possible our modern understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs.\n\tSubsequently, the British Museum actively supported excavations in Egypt into the twentieth century. By 1924, the collection contained more than 50,000 objects. The museum gained hundreds more acquisitions until changes were made to antiquities laws in Egypt. In the 2000s alone, millions of items were given to the British Museum\u2019s Egyptian collections by benefactors from around the world.\n\tSome nations protest that so many cultural artifacts are housed outside of Egypt\u2019s borders. Currently, many countries around the world are trying to repatriate objects to their original homelands. A concerted effort is being made to reduce illegal acquisition of cultural artifacts. However, the fact remains that many of these objects would have been lost or destroyed hundreds of years ago had they not been placed in the British Museum\u2019s collection. The relics of the past belong to humanity, not just to nation-states, and they should be shared by all, and for all. Passage 13B As shocking as it may seem, the shameful ownership of ill-gotten antiquities has continued unabated around the world for much of recent history, despite a number of laws and international agreements that came into force in the last century to work toward ending the trafficking of illegally possessed artifacts and art around the world. As early as the turn of the twentieth century, nations around the world began to make it official government policy that all cultural property belongs to the country, not to an excavator or buyer.\n\tThe practice of cultural racketeering is especially high in countries that are suffering from economic crisis. For example, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Peru, and Guatemala are some of the countries severely impacted by the loss of national treasures and historical artifacts. The losses are not only financial but also affect the nation\u2019s cultural identity and unity. Stolen artifacts are often resold on the black market to private collectors or to fund other illegal activities.\n\tAt present, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property is the world\u2019s most influential and vigorous international antiquities agreement. The nations that signed the agreement and became members of the convention are allowed to repossess stolen or illegally exported antiquities from other member states. Sadly, not all nations joined the convention immediately. For example, the United States did not incorporate the agreement into American law until 1983, and Britain did not become a signatory nation until 2001.\n\tAlthough it is important for nations of the world to carefully preserve and share their cultural history with other nations\u2014and institutions such as museums, auction houses, and art galleries have been essential tools in that endeavor\u2014each nation that has had antiquities pilfered from them for centuries should have the right to reclaim those items. However, galleries and museums do not want to give up items that may have cost millions of dollars to attain. The only solution is to share the artifacts through traveling exhibitions, with the explicit understanding that they are simply on loan.",
