  "passage": "\tLeonardo DaVinci might be best known for his paintings the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, but he actually spent most of his time thinking up and inventing new machines. Sometimes considered the original \u201cRenaissance Man\u201d by scholars, DaVinci was an artist, a scientist, an architect, a teacher, an engineer, and an inventor. He was also centuries ahead of his time in his studies of human anatomy. Few people knew this because \n\t and his social status prevented him from getting higher formal education, well-paying jobs, or access to connections that mieht have votten him published.\n\tWhen DaVinci was 15, he was apprenticed to a painter in Florence, Italy. During this time, he learned and refined his artistic skills that would benefit his future work and make him a singularly unique man. In 1482, he moved to the city of Milan, primarily a \u201cwar city,\u201d and convinces the Duke of Milan to hire him as a military engineer. For the next 17 years, DaVinci designed and built war machines and aqueducts, and spent the rest of his time painting, sculpting, inventing, studying science, and conceiving new ideas for machines. Way ahead of his time in understanding the applications of force, gravity, and thebiomechanics of the human body, many of his inventions could be considered precursors to modern technology.\n\tOne invention DaVinci improved upon was the anemometer. This device measured wind speed, and he improved it to make it more accurate for measuring not only the speed but the force as well. Today, anemometers are essential in the study of meteorology. He also designed the \u201cAerial Screw\u201d that had a spiral frame that was covered in silk and when turned with a crank, the spiral would revolve, creating lift. This was a concept later used in helicopters. He invented a flying machine thats wings were framed in lightweight wood and covered with linen or silk. A pilot would lie on a platform between the wings and turn a crank that made them move up and down. DaVinci based the design for these wings on a bat\u2019s wings. They also incorporated a twisting motion, not just the vertical motion that would later be applied to steering and changing altitudes. There is no evidence the machine was ever built, but no human would ever be able to crank it fast enough to get off the ground.\n\t[1] DaVinci\u2019s concepts and inventions number into the hundreds, butwhen people built these inventions based on his original designs, most of them worked. [2] But it was his studies into the human body that could have revolutionized science. [3] DaVinci performed close to 30 autopsies in his lifetime. [4] These autopsies led to comprehensive works on the anatomy of the human body and the understanding of how the body systems functioned together as moving parts. [5] He began with sketches of the human skull, and over the years compiled a collection of 240 drawings with over 13,000 words of notes into a manuscript called Anatomical Manuscript A.\n\tHe was most interested in understanding the structure of the heart. DaVinci was the first person to state it had four chambers and that the atria and ventricles moved with opposing forces, alternately contracting and relaxing to pump the blood. Had DaVinci been able to publish his works, modern medicine might have evolved centuries earlier. His set of skills as an artist combined with his discoveries make him a unique figure in \n\t to this day, medical students often refer to his sketches as being more intricate than those in many standardized text books.",
