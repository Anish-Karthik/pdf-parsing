Not physically, but the global community ts more interconnected than ever thanks to technology and a myriadof transportation options. People are moving, and they are doing so on an international scale. Immigration and emigration, job opportunities, educational experiences, and mixed culture families are creating more diversity than ever, and sometimes it becomes dificult to trace the heritage that makes you, well,you. The new trend of at home DNA tests 1s capitalizing on people\u2019s intrinsic desires to know more about who they are and where they come from, and it is a booming business.\n\tAncestryDNA is one of the largest commercial DNA test companies, with a database of over 2.5 million registered users and growing faster than any other company. They sold 1.5 million kits in 2017 on Black Friday. AncestryDNA is one of the most popular testing companies because of its elaborate marketing strategies and additional services offered, like family tree integration and shared DNA matches within the database. Erra If a person is looking for something more reliable, 23andMe is the way to go. With the most reliable ethnicity estimates, medical traits reports, and a chromosome browser. 23andMe offers.more in-depth knowledge about an individual person\u2019s DNA, not just general genealogy. Technology is making DNA more comprehensible and accessible to the averace person and discovery of DNA and its connections to hereditary genetics began about 150 years ago.\n\tDeoxyribonucleic acid, DNA, research dates back to \n\t linking DNA to society\u2019s current concepts of it really began in 1950 when Erwin Chargaff proved DNA was species specific. Incredibly, human beings worldwide share 99 percent of the same DNA! In 1953, the double helix structure Was discovered, enabling researchers to see the DNA strands mapping out chromosomal pairs. These chromosomes contain the genes that determine the biological heritage of an individual that can reveal ethnic heritage and discover familial relationships, predispositions for genetic disorders, risk factors for health, and other productive applications, including solving crimes. But all this knowledge may not lead to the same excited consumers seen in the commercial. There are a number of possible consequences to DNA discoveries that are not so happy.\n\t[1] First, identified ethnic origins can be misleading, as regions and countries have changed names and boundaries over the centuries. [2] What a country is today micht not be where 2 persons ancestors trace back to hundreds ofyears ago. [3] Second, although these tests can reveal genetic health risks for Parkinson\u2019s disease or Alzheimer\u2019s, there is no guarantee a person will develop it, and the emotional strain of thinking about it could have a serious impact on a person\u2019s life. [4] Genetic testing for the BRCA gene can tell a woman if she is at risk for breast cancer, but many women who are diagnosed test negative for the gene. [5] Additionally,, though not often, some people discover things they wish they hadn\u2019t, like mistaken paternity or evidence of unexpected relatives. [6] The creation of centralized DNA databases also carries the danger that private information might leak out and be used for genetic and ethnic identification and potential discrimination.\n\tThe ability to test our DNA at home and discover more information about who we are and where we come from is an exciting opportunity. The information learned has the potential to improve the quality of lives, identify and cure diseases, reconnect long-lost relatives, and give identities to people who may have no idea about their family\u2019s heritage. But consumers should also be aware of the possible risks involved, and carefully research the privacy policies of these at-home tests to protect themselves and their personal information. rt",
