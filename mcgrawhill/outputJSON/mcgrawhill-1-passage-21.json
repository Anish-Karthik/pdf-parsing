  "passage": "\tA hoarder is someone who is unable or unwilling to throw items away, and the disposal of items causes them considerable anguish. When people hoard a massive number of objects, it takes over the livable spaces of their home. As the collection grows, they are unable to do simple, quotidian activities such as cooking a meal or watching TV. Sometimes the hoarding is so severe that portions of their homes become inaccessible.\n\tBut among the many problems that such behavior brings about, the most significant are the health risks. Once hallways and windows are blocked, hoarders are at risk of dying in a fire, as they no longer have a clear path of evacuation. Piles that are stacked up high can fall on top of the homeowner, or a person trying to climb over a stack of objects can experience a fall. There is also the problem of poor sanitation. Areas where food cannot be properly cleaned begin to attract roaches and vermin, and bathrooms that are full of many possessions can no longer be washed and scoured. Pets living in the home of a hoarder can also suffer health problems and risk injury or neglect due to the conditions of the home. The animals may be exposed to dangerous objects or poisonous chemicals that are not properly stored.\n\tUnfortunately, the severity of the problem can escalate for two reasons. One is that because the behavior progresses behind closed doors, people can amass collections of objects for years before friends or family members become aware of the problem. Technology enables hoarding by removing some of the challenges that a person would face having to shop in real life. The ability to make purchases and other transactions online allows items to be delivered right to customers without the potential obstacle of transportation.\n\tAdditionally, it becomes easier to spend more than you can afford when paying with a credit card. Hoarding can cause significant financial debt. The side effects of hoarding can cause irreparable damage to relationships, especially if the people involved cohabitate, because they may disagree that it is a problem, argue about paying bills and spending money, or disagree about the use of space in the home. Another challenge is that hoarders often do not recognize that they have a problem, and will continue to live in denial until they get professional help.\n\tWhen attempting to make a diagnosis, psychologists do not categorize hoarding as a disorder in itself. Instead, it is often seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, anxiety, or attention- deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Hoarding items may be one way for a person to feel more secure and prepared for an unexpected situation. The mental health community has only recently begun an intensive study of hoarding, and more research is needed in order to understand its causes and find effective treatment.",
