  "passage": "\tWith the world\u2019s population swelling and the water supply dwindling, the availability of freshwater for human consumption is a growing concern. One- sixth of the world\u2019s population does not have access to clean drinking water. Two million people die each year from a lack of clean, freshwater for drinking, cooking, and everyday needs. Agriculture and industry account for 90 percent of freshwater use around the world.\n\tAquifers are a main source of freshwater. Rainwater seeps into the ground through porous rock where it is stored until a well is drilled for access. However, the lakes, rivers, and streams that feed these aquifers are drying up due to a lack of rain and meltwater running off mountains. The Colorado River has dried up so much it no longer runs all the way to the ocean. California\u2019s aquifers are diminishing up to 11 inches a year.\n\tWater consumption is expected to grow 55 percent by the year 2050. However, freshwater continues to be compromised by poor distribution management, overdevelopment, bacteria, and diseases, in addition to the effects of climate change.\n\tAs sources of water disappear, methods for producing freshwater are being explored on a large scale. Desalination of ocean water is growing in popularity. However, it is a costly process and there are concerns that the energy needed to run these plants creates even more pollution. Some countries are experimenting with solar-powered desalination technologies. Another option is treating wastewater to be reused.\n\tSteps have also been taken to encourage developed nations to use water more economically. Manufacturers now produce toilets that need almost no water to remove waste, as well as appliances that are much more efficient. Public awareness campaigns are also common, urging people to use less water during their daily routine, such as when they shower or brush their teeth. Using sprinkler systems on timers to water gardens and lawns saves hundreds of gallons of water per year. Solar panels reduce the need to produce electricity with fossil fuels that contaminate water sources. The government offers tax breaks and bonuses for purchasing other energy saving items for homes. While these steps are laudable, more needs to be done to protect the water sources that remain and share the water responsibly between all countries.",
