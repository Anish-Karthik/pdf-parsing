  "passage": "\tFrom the table at which they had been lunching, two American ladies of ripe but well-cared-for middle age moved across the lofty terrace of the Roman restaurant and, leaning on its parapet, looked first at each other, and then down on the outspread glories of the Palatine and the Forum, with the same expression of vague but benevolent approval.\n\tThe luncheon hour was long past, and the two had their end of the vast terrace to themselves. At its opposite extremity, a few groups, detained by a lingering look at the outspread city, were gathering up guidebooks and fumbling for tips. The last of them scattered, and the two ladies were alone on the air-washed height.\n\t\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see why we shouldn\u2019t just stay here,\u201d said Mrs. Slade, the lady of the high color and energetic brows. Two derelict basket chairs stood near, and she pushed them into the angle of the parapet, and settled herself in one, her gaze upon the Palatine. \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s still the most beautiful view in the world.\u201d\n\t\u201cIt always will be, to me,\u201d assented her friend Mrs. Ansley, with so slight a stress on the \u201cme\u201d that Mrs. Slade, though she noticed it, wondered if it were not merely accidental, like the random underlinings of old-fashioned letter writers.\n\t\u201cGrace Ansley was always old fashioned,\u201d she thought, and added aloud, with a retrospective smile: \u201cIt\u2019s a view we\u2019ve both been familiar with for a good many years. When we first met here, we were younger than our girls are now. You remember!\u201d\n\t\u201cOh, yes, I remember,\u201d murmured Mrs. Ansley, with the same indefinable stress\u2014\u201cThere\u2019s that headwaiter wondering,\u201d she interpolated. She was evidently far less sure of herself and of her rights in the world than Mrs. Slade.\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll cure him of wondering,\u201d said Mrs. Slade, stretching her hand toward\n\tMrs. Slade\u2019s black brows drew together, as though references to the moon were out of place and even unwelcome. But she smiled away her frown as the headwaiter retreated. \u201cWell, why not! We might do worse. There\u2019s no knowing, I suppose, when the girls will be back. Do you even know back from where? I don\u2019t!\u201d\n\tMrs. Ansley again colored slightly. \u201cI think those young Italian aviators we met at the embassy invited them to fly to Tarquinia for tea. I suppose they\u2019ll want to wait and fly back by moonlight.\u201d\n\t\u201cMoonlight\u2014moonlight! What a part it still plays in the lives of young lovers. Do you suppose they\u2019re as sentimental as we were?\u201d\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I don\u2019t in the least know what they are,\u201d said Mrs. Ansley. \u201cAnd perhaps we didn\u2019t know much more about each other.\u201d\n\t\u201cNo, perhaps we didn\u2019t.\u201d Her friend gave her a shy glance. \u201cI never should have supposed you were sentimental, Alida.\u201d",
