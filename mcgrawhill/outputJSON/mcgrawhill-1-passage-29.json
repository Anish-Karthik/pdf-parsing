I start off thinking this year is going to be the year sticks on me and life changes,spreadsheets with points and calories and measurements. By February, I\u2019m lucky if I exercise once a week, and dinner is often takeout, picked up on the way home from work and mindlessly consumed in front of a television show I rushed home to watch. The food might have taste good, but I never paid attention. I was too exhausted to think about where it was coming from or what I ordered. Repeated failure weighed me down, with no solution in sight. Then, one rare day at the gym, I was flipping through Forbes magazine, and an article on the top food trends for the new year caught my eye.\n\tThe article stated that the top food trend for the coming year was mindfulness. Driven by Millennials, mindfulness is a new consumer perspective of shopping for a product or a brand based on how it aligns with personal values. Understanding, respecting, and valuing the food people put into their bodies. [Thinking about where products come from, how they are produced.and distributed, and what impact those choices have on our eating habits. The grocery industry is being pushed to appeal to consumers physically and intellectually, informing and empowering shoppers to make a easier,healthier, and more fun experience. To keep pace with the trends, 17 major food companies have replaced CEOs in the last year in an effort to bring fresh new ideas to the industry.\n\tI knew advertising was designed to make people want to buy products, but it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that grocery stores and product brands really studied not only what people were buying, but how and why they were buying it. The article went on to state that 7 out of 10 shoppers want to be able to read and understand the ingredients list, they seek out organic, all-natural, non-GMO labels, and locally sourced products to support their communities. In fact, last year was only the second time since 1900 there was an increase in farmers under the age of 35, suggesting this was a direct result of a shift to mindful eating and shopping.\n\tAlthough I was curious about the connections to local farming, and what made a product organic or fair-trade certified and why I would want to buy it, I still didn\u2019t understand what mindful eating was and how it would benefit me in cetting my goals when, thus far, every other diet and exercise plan had failed. How could a diet that lets you eat whatever you want help you lose weight, reduce binge eating and snacking, or increase energy levels? It sounded too good to be true, but mindful eating, often referred to by nutritionists as the anti-diet, is about thinking about every aspect of the food people put in their bodies. What foods do I choose; why am I eating them; how does eating the food make me feel; and where am I eating?\n\tThis mind-body connection between food and me was intriguing enough that I started to think about what days I grabbed takeout, how much I would enjoy eating in front of the TV instead of at the table, and how often I overate and felt too full. Becoming more mindful about what food was going into my body and where it came from encouraged healthier, ethically and locally sourced choices that I felt good about physically and emotionally. Changing where I ate meals and how much time I spent eating them renewed my enjoyment of flavors and textures and allowed my brain a healthy amount of time to signal that I was full. In fact, the overall positive influence of mindful eating on my life has resulted in more focus and energy, less stress over dieting and my weight, and increased awareness of my connection to a global community through food.",
