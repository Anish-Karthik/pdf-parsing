  "passage": "\tThe term alien invaders often conjure up colorful images of flying saucers or giant robots from outer space trying to wipe out humanity. It does not usually make a person think of fish. But the Asian carp is an invader. This fish is just one of hundreds of species that do not belong in America\u2019s ecosystem, and now that their here, they aren\u2019t going anywhere. The fish were originally brought to the United States in the 1980s by various fish farmers as a natural alternative to clean artificially created ponds in Arkansas and other Southern and Midwestern states along the Mississippi River. When massive flooding occurred in the 1990s, those fish were able to escape the self-contained farm ponds into the rivers, jumping as high as four feet out of the water, and as they traveled north, they consumed everything in their path.\n\t[1] Many people wonder why a fish could be so dangerous. [2] There are four species of Asian carp currently breeding in American waterways. The silver carp can grow up to 70 pounds and lay hundreds of thousands of eggs at one time. [3] That is a lot of mouths to feed. Because the carp are filter feeders, meaning they strain small plankton and nutrients from the bottoms of rivers and lakes, they are taking enormous amounts of food that would usually feed the smaller native fish. [4] Native fish, like the walleye, are smaller and fewer. [5] Their eggs are small enough to be accidentally eaten by large carp. [6] And the aggressive behaviors of the carp are also killing off more fragile species like zebra and quagga mussels and the round goby fish living in the Great Lakes.\n\tThe Great Lakes are an area of concern when it comes to the voracious appetites of the Asian carp. The fishing industry there is currently valued at $7 billion a year. It is not just fishermen who are concerned; local mayors and state governments are also investing in research and technologies aimed at stopping this threat to the economy and the fragile Great Lakes ecosystem. Illinois and the federal government have spent $400 million over the years trying to keep these fish away from the Great Lakes. To stop the spread of the carp, there is an underwater electrical barrier on the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. There are three electrical barriers currently operating along the river where the carp are most likely expected to travel north. The National Park Service and Michigan\u2019s Department of Natural Resources are testing new barriers and higher dams the fish could not jump over. Gril\tThe Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force encourages and supports \u201cactive control\u201d of the fish. In some areas this means holding fishing contests for the carp. The carp is actually a delicious fish and offers an abundant and nutritious source of food for people so local restaurants are encouraged to have it on their menus to promote demand for the fish, in hopes of reducing the population. Continued research and control methods are also being studied and tested. The Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee does DNA monitoring on the fish. Samplings using electrofishing help determine the numbers of fish present in a given area and provide a forensic map of where a fish was swimming over the course of its lifetime. This information is put into a database to track where fish are coming from and how far they might travel.\n\tNot everyone is as concerned that the carp could take over the Great Lakes should the barriers fail. There are currently at least 100 invasive species present in the lakes, disrupting the native species, and to date, less than a dozen Asian carp have made it through all the barriers to get within 10 miles of Lake Michigan. Reverting the Mississippi River back to its original flow might only result in endangering the ecosystems of 31 other states whose waterways are all connected. Lake scientists say Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior are in no danger even if a few carp get in, because the lakes could not hold a breeding population. First, a closed lake system would not produce enough food for the fish to grow to a massive size, and second, the carp must lay their eggs in moving water. In spite of the debates on the actual danger of the invasion, how much money to invest, and how to study these fish, the one thing everyone can agree on is that Asian carp are here to stay.",
