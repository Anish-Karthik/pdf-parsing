  "passage": "\tThe yogurt industry is growing almost faster than any other grocery staple in the United States. In 2010, yogurt was a $4.5 billion industry that Plows to $8.5 billion in 2017. So how did this happen? Creative marketing campaigns by big companies offer one explanation. Dannon, which currently has 34 percent of the US yogurt market, originally made yogurt a mainstream food in the American diet back in the 1970s. It first distributed yogurt in 1942, but popularity did not increase until the addition of a iayer of fruit on the bottomin 1947. Dannon expanded distribution nationally in the 1960s, but it was a commercial in the 1970s that began the yogurt revolution. Barat Tabahra, an 89-year-old Soviet immigrant, went on television and telling the world his long life, and that of his mother, age 114, was due to eating yogurt every day.\n\tFor 75 years, Dannon has continued to expand, and holds the majority of the yogurt industry in the United States. The main reason for this is \n\t Dannon has more brand names and types of yogurt than any other company. Its corporation includes Dannon, Activia, Stonyfield Farms, Danimals, YoCrunch, and Oikos, as well as new yogurt drinks and smoothies. Dannon offers yogurts produced to appeal to the various demographics across the country, including children, athletes, and on-the-go professionals. And Dannon isn\u2019t the only company leaving a large footprint in the yogurt business.\n\tYogurt has a long history, at least in Europe and the Mediterranean, of being a healthy staple in their cuisines. So it comes as no surprise that yogurt companies are creating yogurt brands, styles, and ad campaigns to appeal to the different needs of consumers. The potential health benefits of yogurt include promoting healthy digestion, lowering the risk of type 2 diabetes, protection against colorectal cancer, protection and treatment of osteoporosis, increased weight loss, and reduced high blood pressure and bad cholesterol. Yogurt alone can\u2019t cure all ills, but as \u201cpart of a healthy diet combined with exercise,\u201d it offers a much healthier snack with numerous options that \n\t available. Ten years ago, no one had heard of Greek yogurt. It represented less than 1 percent of nationwide yogurt sales. Chobani, now a household name in Greek yogurt, began to emerge into the market in 2007. So what strategy was used to bring Greek yogurt from 1 percent of the market to almost half? Chief marketing officer for Chobani, Peter McGuiness, decided the company needed a new approach, and began to hold yogurt tastings. Food sales increase exponentially when people fet tO interact with the food, do taste comparisons, and build relationships with the company. Greek yogurt represented $1.5 billion of the total yogurt sales for 2017.\n\tYogurt is still a growing business. It is less expensive than most other snacks and has many alleged health benefits. \n\t Available in cups, bottles, pouches, tubs, and tubes. In the last five years, joining the variety of flavors, low fat, nonfat, blended, and Greek will be Icelandic, Australian, coconut milk, soy milk, strained, and organic. With a yogurt for every taste, the yogurt industry can rest assured that profits will continue to grow along with consumer appetites.",
