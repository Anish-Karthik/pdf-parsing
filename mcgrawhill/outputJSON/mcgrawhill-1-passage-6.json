  "passage": "\tAccording to a recent report, rates in the United States are diminishing for both the diagnoses of new cancers, also known as incidence, and the death rate for all cancers combined. This is true for both men and women, especially in the most frequent cancers among men (lung, colon, and prostate) and women (breast and colon). Cancer death rates declined by 13 percent between 2004 and 2013. Forty percent of reported cancer cases are linked to tobacco use. However, the lung cancer death rate varies dramatically between states and regions.\n\tDeviation in smoking pervasiveness is influenced by several factors, including public awareness of the harm of tobacco use, tolerance of tobacco use within the community, local tobacco control activities, and local promotional activities by the tobacco industry. The states where lung cancer death rates for women are on the rise have higher percentages of adult female smokers, low taxes on tobacco products, and local economies that have been dependent on tobacco farming and production for generations.\n\tMen and women continue to have higher incidence and death rates in areas where tobacco use is deeply rooted in daily life, stated the director of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Tobacco farming regions like the South and Midwest have the highest rates of smokers. The geographic disparity in smoking-related cancers is therefore due mostly to behaviors, not environmental factors such as exposure to pollutants or chemicals, she added. West Virginia has the highest rate of female smokers and no laws banning smoking in any public places. It also has the lowest tobacco taxes in the country.\n\tIn contrast, California was the first state to implement a statewide tobacco control program that includes high taxes and laws against smoking in public places, such as restaurants and city parks, to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke. And it was one of the only two states, in addition to Utah, to show declines in both lung cancer incidence and deaths in women. The report also draws a comparison between lung and skin cancers, which are both firmly influenced by behavior.\n\tOther highly encouraging findings revealed by the report include decreases in incidence and death rates in nearly all racial and ethnic groups. CDC reports overall smoking trends have decreased from 21 percent in 2005 to 15 percent in 2015. Once again, states with targeted programs have better results.\n\tAll these achievements, however, must be seen as a starting point rather than a destination. A dual effort regarding the inextricable link between smoking and cancer and targeted anti-smoking campaigns, as well as ongoing research to improve prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancers, will be needed to augment this progress into the future.",
