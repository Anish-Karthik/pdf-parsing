  "passage": "\tAfter graduating college, I realized I wanted to have my own place, be able to travel, live a more eco-friendly lifestyle, escape from the world once in a while, and still be able to pay for it all without going into more debt. The more research I did, the more I realized I had two options: off-grid or tiny house living. Both options were way more involved than just selling all my stuff, hopping into my truck, and taking off down the open road. I had to consider location, budget, resources, energy production, food, water, land, zoning laws, and why I wanted to live this lifestyle in the first place.\n\tPeople decide to live off the grid or in tiny houses for a variety of reasons. For some people, 1ts a financial situation. They don\u2019t want a mortgage or the high cost of utilities and maintenance associated with a larger home. A person might have lost his or her job, and with little to no income, this might be the only option. Some people want to live more sustainable lives and reduce their carbon footprints, and others want to completely escape society and become \u201cuntraceable.\u201d Living off the grid means different things depending on which \u201cgrid\u201d you are trying to get away from. Some tiny houses are \u201coff-crid. and others are merely tiny versions of a regular home with scaled down amenities.\n\tI had to think about my goals. I wanted low maintenance, energy efficiency, optional permanence, and a sense of security. A tent or RV might suit some people, but it would not meet my needs. A tiny house would have options to fit exactly what I wanted. With homes as small as 100 square feet, I would definitely be able to declutter my life and maintain the space. Tiny houses use significantly less energy, and with optional solar panels or wind turbines for alternative energy, it would be much less expensive than a single- family home or apartment. Water should be an issue, but a tiny home could be connected to a well, and some roofs could be designed to harvest rainwater and store it in barrels. A plot of land to park it on and a trailer to tow it ofters options for multiple locations.\n\tSome tiny houses can be purchased or built for less than $15,000, depending on materials, so it could be purchased outright instead of getting a loan. Do-it-yourself kits can save thousands, but without construction experience, they are not recommended. Depending on materials, finishings, and labor, a person could spend more than $100,000 on a tiny house! Sometimes it is less expensive to convert an existing structure like a shipping container, a horse trailer, or a shed. But off-grid living, whether in a tiny house or living primitively, is not legal everywhere and not always economically viable. States and cities have different zonine laws, varying tax rates for residential and acricultural properties, different.requirements for being hooked up to city utilities like electrical or sewer systems, and land prices can be drastically different depending on how close they are to major cities.\n\t Using these guidelines, I narrowed down, for tiny houses, the top states to live in to five. Northern California has mild climates, plenty of water sources, lower taxes, and less strict land ordinances. Prices are fair, but not cheap. Northern Arizona has cheap land and great weather, but access to water could be an issue. New Hampshire, if you can deal with long, cold, snowy winters, are cheap. It has the most affordable land (much of it remote with tons of natural resources for food, heat, and water), legal off-grid zoning and reasonable building codes, and the lowest state and property taxes in the country. Finally, Florida, despite rumors, has made off-grid and tiny house living the most accessible, especially in rural areas. Proper septic tanks and clean water are required, but land is affordable, and residents can have solar panels and wind turbines for energy, water wells, gardens, and even livestock to remain self-sufficient. Wherever I end up calling home, off-grid and tiny house living offer better health, more financial freedom, less stress, and greater personal satisfaction than mainstream living.",
