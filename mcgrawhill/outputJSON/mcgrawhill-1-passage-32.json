Government officials struggle to identify culprits who leave gang tags, obscenities, and crude illustrations. The graffiti promotes a negative vibe and gives neighborhoods, sometimes undeservedly, bad reputations. And yet sometimes, seemingly out of nowhere, a piece of art appears on a canvas of concrete, making a statement loud enough for the world to hear. One such art \u201cbomber\u201d is an anonymous street artist in London, England, known only as \u201cBanksy.\u201d Banksy is one of the most famous and controversial, long-lived graffiti artists in the world, producing new works as recently as January 2018.\n\tBanksy got his start in Bristol, England, in the early 1990s as a teenager, partnering with other street artists. Even with half a dozen of them, the artwork took time to create, and it was a close call with the police that finally moved Banksy to adapt his approach to something that would be faster. His friends all cot to the car and escaped, buc Banksy had to hide under a garbage truck for along time, and that was when he decided he needed to be able to complete his art faster. The idea of using spray paint and precut stencils appealed to him and became his signature style.\n\tIn the early 2000s, he headed to London. His art is often full of contradictions, dark humor, and satirical perspectives on politics and global issues. One particular piece of art that represents this is of a young Vietnamese person who was burned by napalm being escorted by Mickey Mouse and Ronald McDonald. In 2001, Banksy and a few other street artists had their first \u201cart opening\u201d in a tunnel on Rivington Street in London. In disguise, they painted the walls of the tunnel white. Later that week, they held an opening reception, with hip-hop music blasting and beer from a nearby pub. Nearly 500 people attended. During his last face-to-face interview in 2003 after his \u201cTurf War\u201d exhibition, in response to the debate about maintaining his anonymity, the artist emphasized the importance of a direct connection between the artist and the audience. It wasnt important they know who he is, but that his art is accessibleeveryone.\n\tIn February 2008, Banksy\u2019s work was part of the biggest charity art auction to date, with proceeds totaling $425 million. One of his pieces, titled Ruined Landscape, ZO $385,000; it was a painting of an autumn landscape along a riverbank, with the words \u201cThis is not a photo opportunity\u201d stenciled across the middle. Another piece, A Vandalized Phonebox, showed an old- fashioned red telephone booth knocked over with a pickax and red paint that looked like blood dripping down the side. This painted was purchased for $605,000.\n\tBanksy continued to challenge authorities and inspired fans, sneaking pieces of his art into famous museums, including the Louvre in France and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Critics have called him a causes, charities, and movements. Today, more than half of his street paintings are only viewable on the internet and are available to download for free. They have been painted over by city workers or worn away by time and weather conditions. Photographs of new art appear on his website, and he challenges fans to find acy sustaining the mystery, the challenge, and the movement that is \u201cBanksy.\u201d",
