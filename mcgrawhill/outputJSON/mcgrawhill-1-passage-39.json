Schools are putting more focus on academic preparation tor higher education, but it isnt always the best fitfor everyone. Students have less exposure to hands-on training unless they attend a technical school, and this has resulted in a significant decrease in the number of young people entering into vocational fields. For the past several years, skilled trades have been listed as the hardest positions to fill when hiring new employees. Skilled trades refers to any occupation that requires specialized, hand-on skills; skilled trade people include machinists, welders, electricians, plumbers, mechanical engineers, and large machine operators.\n\t[1] After the recession in 2008-2009, hundreds if not thousands of skilled trade people were out of work. [2] The housing market crashed and no new construction was happening. [3] These workers often left the trade for other careers to put money in their pockets and food on their tables. [4] But as the economy improves, the demand for these trades is increasing, and those workers are now significantly older. [5] Approximately 53 percent of trade workers are over the age of 45. For electricians, this number is 60 percent. [6] Estimates indicate 3 million jobs could open up in the next decade, but at current hiring rates, two-thirds of those would be unfilled.\n\tThe vocational trades have a bad reputation as jobs for uneducated or unskilled laborers, for being low-paying or lacking in advancement opportunities. But all of this is untrue. Most trades require a very specialized set of skills. Manufacturing, for example, no longer pertains to assembly lines of workers putting items together, but to someone with the technology and problem-solving skills to program, maintain, and repair the equipment. It offers opportunities for advancement and good starting wages, and when combined with relevant further education, can offer career paths that earn large salaries.\n\tPlumbing is another example of an evolving, high-demand trade. Whether it is new construction, rebuilding from natural disasters, or unclogging the pipes under the sink, plumbers are needed ubiquitously. But plumbing isn\u2019t just pipes anymore; it\u2019s using green technology, harvesting rainwater, and sanitizing water for hurricane victims, among other things. Construction workers need to be to having good interpersonal and problem-solving skills. According to the US Census Bureau, people who have four-year degrees, excluding those who go on to graduate school, in humanities highly intelligent with good math skills and excellent spatial! abilities, in addition the lowest earnings because they are much less likely to be working in their fields of study.\n\tThis isn\u2019t to say that high school students should abandon college degrees in favor of becoming a welder or wind turbine engineer, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics does report that many careers that don\u2019t require four-year degrees have average starting salaries above $40,000 a year. Most of these trades would give someone the opportunity to start working and earning immediately, often with on-the-job training, in a field that interests them. Workers could then elect to move on to higher education that relates toadvancing in their fields while not accruing significant debt. In many cases, employers will pay for the coursework or training as an incentive.",
