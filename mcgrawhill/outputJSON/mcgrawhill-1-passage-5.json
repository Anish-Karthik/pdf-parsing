  "passage": "\tDuring World War II, sending and receiving codes required hours of encrypting and decrypting. The Japanese used their considerable skill as code breakers to intercept many messages being sent by American forces in the Pacific.\n\tIn an effort to find quicker and more secure ways to send and receive communications, the United States enlisted Navajo Indians to relay critical information between military units. The Navajo language was chosen in part because of its complex grammatical structure and syntax. In addition, it was still an unwritten language at that time and was spoken only on the Navajo lands of the American Southwest. As a result, the use of the Navajo language as a code was a remarkable success. Crucial battles, including the famous Battle of Iwo Jima, were successful because of the use of the Navajo code. And after the war, Japan\u2019s chief of intelligence admitted they were never able to break it.\n\tIt is estimated that more than 400 Navajos served in this program, which remained highly classified until 1968. The code talkers returned home without fanfare after the war and were sworn to secrecy about the code\u2019s existence. For decades, the American people had no idea that the US triumph in the Pacific theater was partly because of these courageous men. Luckily, the exploits of these heroic soldiers are finally making their way into mainstream American history. Passage 5B Thanks to recent Hollywood movies and TV documentaries, when you mention code talkers, most people today immediately think of the now- legendary bilingual Navajo soldiers recruited during World War II. But, in fact, this type of code talking did not begin in that war, and Navajo was not the first language used.\n\tThe original code talkers were Choctaw Indians from southeastern Oklahoma, and it was their language that was first utilized near the end of World War I. It is said that an American officer got the idea to use Choctaw while serving in France. Overhearing a couple of Choctaw Indians in his company speaking to each other in their native language, he supposed that it would likely make an unbreakable code that the US Army could use to get information past the Germans. His hunch proved to be correct. Choctaw soldiers were soon placed in each company, and Choctaw was spoken over radio waves.\n\tAlthough the Navajo code talkers are the most famous, Navajo was not even the only Native American language used during World War II. Choctaw was also used, in addition to other languages, such as Cherokee, Lakota Meskwaki, and Comanche. The Navajo received recognition from Congress in 2000 for their contributions. But clearly the Choctaw deserved praise as well for their valor and dedication. Finally, in 2013, a bill was passed honoring the 33 tribes who had sent code talkers to the battlefields. Unfortunately, none of the Choctaw that had been in WWI were still alive to attend, but their children were.",
