  "passage": "Long viewed by many as the stereotypical useless\nmajor, philosophy is now being seen by many students\nand prospective employers as in fact a very useful and\npractical major, offering students a host of transferable\nskills with relevance to the modern workplace. 34 In\nbroad terms, philosophy is the study of meaning and the\nvalues underlying thought and behavior. But 35 more\npragmatically, the discipline encourages students to\nanalyze complex material, question conventional beliefs,\nand express thoughts in a concise manner.\n\tBecause philosophy 36 teaching students not what\nto think but how to think, the age-old discipline offers\nconsistently useful tools for academic and professional\nachievement. 37 A 1994 survey concluded that only\n18 percent of American colleges required at least one\nphilosophy course. 38 Therefore, between 1992 and\n1996, more than 400 independent philosophy\ndepartments were eliminated from institutions.\n\tMore recently, colleges have recognized the\npracticality and increasing popularity of studying\nphilosophy and have markedly increased the number of\nphilosophy programs offered. By 2008 there were\n817 programs, up from 765 a decade before. In addition,\nthe number of four-year graduates in philosophy has\ngrown 46 percent in a decade. Also, studies have found\nthat those students who major in philosophy often do\nbetter than students from other majors in both verbal\nreasoning and analytical 39 writing. These results can be\nmeasured by standardized test scores. On the Graduate\nRecord Examination (GRE), for example, students\nintending to study philosophy in graduate school 40 has\nscored higher than students in all but four other majors.\n\tThese days, many 41 student\u2019s majoring in\nphilosophy have no intention of becoming philosophers;\ninstead they plan to apply those skills to other disciplines.\nLaw and business specifically benefit from the\ncomplicated theoretical issues raised in the study of\nphilosophy, but philosophy can be just as useful in\nengineering or any field requiring complex analytic skills.\n42 That these skills are transferable across professions\n43 which makes them especially beneficial to\ntwenty-first-century students. Because today\u2019s students\ncan expect to hold multiple jobs\u2014some of which may not\neven exist yet\u2014during 44 our lifetime, studying\nphilosophy allows them to be flexible and adaptable.\nHigh demand, advanced exam scores, and varied\nprofessional skills all argue for maintaining and\nenhancing philosophy courses and majors within\nacademic institutions.",
