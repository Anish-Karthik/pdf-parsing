  "passage": "\tIn 1924, when jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong  rehearsed with Fletcher Henderson\u2019s band for the first  time, he shocked Henderson by refusing to 23 bond  with the score as written and playing notes at whatever  volume he wanted. The other band members, who were  used to playing standard dance music in meticulous,  predictable arrangements, purportedly responded to  Armstrong\u2019s untraditional methods with skepticism and  derision. Over a short time, though, Armstrong won over  Henderson and the band with his undeniably brilliant  musical talent. \n\tAs band members grew to admire Armstrong\u2019s  masterful 24 improvisations. They in turn began to  experiment with incorporating improvised solos of their  own. In one of the earliest recordings of Armstrong  playing with Henderson\u2019s band, the band mainly follows  the standard written arrangement of a dance song. The  exceptions are a couple of short solos\u2014not only  25 Armstrong\u2019s performances but also by saxophonist  Coleman Hawkins. Not long afterward, the group\u2019s style  transformed dramatically. A 1925 recording of  \u201cSugarfoot Stomp\u201d by Henderson\u2019s band features an  extended solo by Armstrong, his trumpet blazing out  against the saxophone backup. 26 Band member  Howard Scott recalls a particular night at the Roseland  Ballroom: \u201cMy goodness, people stopped dancing to  come around and listen to him.... The  next night you  couldn\u2019t get into the place.\u201d \n\t27 In addition to incorporating solos into its  performances, the band evolved in other ways.  Henderson had been working with musician and  composer Don Redman to develop arrangements of  songs that used a call-and-response 28 structure.  According to jazz historians Gary Giddins and Scott  DeVeaux, Redman acknowledged that he had, in fact,  29 adjusted and altered the structure of his musical  arrangements in part to accommodate Armstrong\u2019s  distinct style. Giddins and DeVeaux describe the result as  music 30 that, \u201cbegan to take on a commanding  directness and sharper rhythmic gait.\u201d \n\tArmstrong left Henderson\u2019s band in 1925. His  influence, 31 for instance, is discernible in the band\u2019s  later recordings. The collaboration between Armstrong  and Henderson had put into motion a significant stylistic  shift in jazz music: the polished sound of dance-hall  music had given 32 away to the prominent solo features  and call-and-response 33 arrangements, that would  become hallmarks of the 1930s swing era music.",
