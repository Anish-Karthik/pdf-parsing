In another example of how the return of a top  predator can have far-reaching ecological effects,  researchers have found that the reintroduction of the  Line gray wolf to Yellowstone National Park has boosted  5 an important food source for the threatened grizzly  bear. A study published in the Journal of Animal  Ecology is essentially a tale of who eats what.  When wolves were reintroduced to the park in  1995 after a 70-year absence, they preyed on elk  10 herds that browsed trees and shrubs.The elk  population, which had exploded without the wolves,  dropped. The over-browsed plants began to rebound,  including berry-producing shrubs that provide  nutritious summer meals for grizzlies when they are  15 fattening up for hibernation.  \u201cThe grizzly bear uses some of the same plants  that the prey of the wolf uses,\u201d said William Ripple,  an Oregon State University professor of forest  ecosystems and lead author of the study. \u201cThe  20 reintroduction of one top predator is potentially  affecting another top predator through this food  web.\u201d  Ripple and his fellow researchers at OSU and  Washington State University compared the  25 frequency of fruit found in grizzly bear scat (animal  fecal droppings) to elk numbers before and after wolf  introduction. Over a 19-year period, they found that  the average proportion of fruit in grizzly scat rose  significantly after wolves returned to Yellowstone  30 and the elk population fell. The scientists examined  and rejected other possible explanations for the  smaller, pre-wolf proportion of fruit in grizzly  diets\u2014such as climate influences or the operation of  open-pit garbage dumps that served as bear mess  35 halls before the last one was closed in 1970.

The main purpose of the passage is to  A) discuss an ecological phenomenon.  B) analyze a scientific experiment.  C) resolve an environmental debate.  D) draw attention to a historic discovery.

A) Unexpected outcome B) Tempting choice C) Definitive solution D) Dangerous event The main purpose of the final paragraph of the  passage is to  A) advise the reader of some potential limitations of  Ripple\u2019s conclusions about the nutritional needs  of the grizzly bear. B) extend the implications of the relationship between wolves and grizzlies in a particular environment to other animals and contexts. C) describe a certain experiment that Ripple will be undertaking in the future to corroborate his findings. D) suggest the potential ramifications of reintroducing another species into an already fragile ecosystem.",
