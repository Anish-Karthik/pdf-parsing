  "passage": "\tVisitors to the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s always marveled at the gap between what they saw in state stores\u2014shelves empty or filled with things no one wanted\u2014and what they saw in people\u2019s homes: nice furnishings and tables filled with food. What filled the gap? A vast informal economy driven by human relationships, dense networks of social connections through which people traded resources and created value. The Soviet people didn\u2019t plot how they would build these networks. No one was teaching them how to maximize their connections the way social marketers eagerly teach us today. Their networks evolved naturally, out of necessity; that was the only way to survive.",
