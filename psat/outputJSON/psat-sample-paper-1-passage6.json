  "passage": "\tWith 30 percent of United States workers not getting enough sleep at night, according to the Wall Street Journal, US companies 1 lose a yearly sum of $63.2 billion annually due to the drop in employee productivity resulting from sleep deprivation. Sleep-deprived workers generally have lower morale and are less able to retain information than their better-rested colleagues.\n\t[1] One of the 2 big reasons behind workers\u2019 lack of sleep is the work itself. [2] To combat the problem of sleep deprivation in a demanding work environment, some companies have begun allowing workers to take naps. [3] The hours the average American 3 spend working have increased dramatically since the 1970s, making it hard for many workers to get a good night\u2019s sleep. [4] Although employees who sleep on the job are often considered lazy and unproductive, napping in the workplace has been shown to improve workers\u2019 efficiency and quality of life. [5] As long as companies continue to demand long hours from 4 workers, and managers should champion napping as a means to keep employees happy, healthy, and functional. 5 Such a proposition may seem counterintuitive, but, in fact, allowing employees to nap could save companies hours of lost productivity. Studies reveal that napping improves memory and boosts wakefulness for the remainder of the day. Napping can also have a positive effect on mood and overall job satisfaction, while constant drowsiness reduces reaction time and hampers one\u2019s ability to concentrate. Employee naps might also lead to reduced health care costs for companies, since regular napping leads to long-term health benefits,\n\tand it improves workers\u2019 average weekly attendance.\n\tNapping at work has already won corporate advocates in the worlds of technology, finance, and news media, and some businesses are beginning to set aside special nap rooms. A few companies, such as Google, have even invested in high-tech nap pods that block out light, play soothing music, and gently waking nappers.\n\tZephrin Lasker, CEO of the mobile-advertising firm Pontiflex, has observed that employees are happier and more productive since he created a nap room in the company\u2019s Brooklyn headquarters. Ryan Hodson of Kodiak Capital Group and Arianna Huffington of the Huffington Post Media Group have promoted napping\n\tthroughout their workers and have been effusive about the results. In light of the benefits not only to employees\u2019 efficiency and again to their health and sense of well-being, these executives\u2019 enthusiasm is not surprising. These executives are among the most successful leaders in their respective fields.",
