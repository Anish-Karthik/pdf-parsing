  "passage": "\tEver since 1 introducing coffee to Italy several  centuries ago, it has been a ubiquitous part of Italian  culture. 2 However, coffee is so central to Italian  culture that one cannot visit any city or town in Italy  without seeing several coffeehouses (called caffetterie in  Italian). Such coffeehouses have existed since 1640, when  the first was established in Venice, and 3 it has since  become a part of Italy\u2019s national identity. It is not  uncommon in Italy for people to make two to three trips  a day to their favorite caffetteria, and often people are so  selective about their coffee that they will frequent only  one establishment. But it is not simply the coffee that  creates such enthusiasm for coffeehouses among those  4 which love them; the social aspect of the caffetteria  may play nearly as great a role as the coffee itself. \n\tEach caffetteria functions as a social hub in its  neighborhood, and the way in which most patrons  consume their coffee 5 contribute to this fact. Few  caffetteria patrons sit at tables, since most coffeehouses in  Italy charge a premium for table service, 6 although  sometimes it\u2019s worth the cost to be able to sit and rest.  Nor can patrons take their drinks elsewhere: to-go cups  are not available at typical coffeehouses. 7 Instead,  most regular patrons of a caffetteria drink their coffee  standing. They do this, often shoulder-to-shoulder, at a  counter or bar. Normally, those drinking their coffee at a  bar will also chat with each other and the person making  coffee behind the bar. This practice, which combines  social interaction with coffee drinking, is the most  popular way to enjoy a cup of coffee in Italy. \n\tIndeed, many Italian coffee enthusiasts agree \n\t9 correct way to make coffee: this  that there is only one  involves filtering water through freshly ground coffee  beans at specific temperatures and pressures, which  produces the concentrated form of coffee known as  espresso. This type of coffee is drunk in Italy in several  forms, either unadulterated or with varying amounts of  milk, and each form has a different name. An espresso  mixed with frothed and steamed milk 10 is a  cappuccino: for example, while an espresso with just a  dollop of steamed milk on top is a caff\u00e8 macchiato. There  are also respected traditions about when these different  coffee drinks should be consumed: while cappuccino is a  popular morning drink, espresso, either plain or diluted  with water, is usually the drink of choice for coffee  drinkers in Italy in the afternoon and evening. 11",
