  "passage": "\tEach year, many species of shorebirds migrate from  locations in the Southern Hemisphere to their breeding  grounds in the 12 Arctic. A journey of thousands of  kilometers that requires frequent stops to fuel up. The  risk of death is significant, and the Arctic is an  inhospitable region for most of the 13 year, yet the  shorebirds never failing to make their annual pilgrimage. \n\tCome spring, the Arctic becomes a suitable habitat,  providing many benefits: an abundant supply of food,  permanent daylight, ample nesting space, fewer  pathogens, and fewer predators to invade the nests of  these ground-dwelling birds. These benefits are found in  all regions of the 14 Arctic regardless of latitude yet  some shorebirds continue on to the high Arctic. If these  birds are simply looking for open space and enough food  to eat, then why not end their long journey in the low  Arctic? Continuing on to the north requires more fuel  and carries an even greater risk of 15 mortality if the  birds continue on. The most likely reason certain  shorebirds head to the high Arctic is to escape their  predators. \n\t[1] A four-year study by a team of Canadian  scientists, headed by student Laura McKinnon of the  Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, 16 provide evidence in support of  this hypothesis. [2] The scientists created artificial nests  that resembled a typical shorebird\u2019s nest. [3] Then each  year, during the shorebirds\u2019 breeding season, forty of the  nests were placed in each of seven locations that ranged  in latitude from the low Arctic to the high Arctic.  [4] Each nest had been baited with four 17 quail egg\u2019s,  which are similar in size and shape to a shorebird\u2019s eggs.  [5] The scientists returned to the nests many times over  nine days to check how many eggs remained in the nests.  [6] A nest was said to have survived if, at the end of the  nine days, it contained at least one undisturbed quail egg. \n\tNest Survival by Site  Surviving nests  (percent of initial) \n\tDay  82\u00b0N  63\u00b0N  53\u00b0N  73\u00b0N  Adapted from L. McKinnon et al., \u201cLower Predation Risk for Migratory  Birds at High Latitudes.\u201d \u00a92010 by American Association for the  Advancement of Science. \n\tThe figure shows the results for the nesting 19 sites,  furthermore, at four of the seven locations, averaged over  the four years of the study. The 20 number of predators  invading the nests increased over time at each location.  This result confirmed that predators were present at the  researchers\u2019 chosen locations. The researchers found that  the percent of 21 surviving nests was greater at locations  having higher latitudes. For example, on day 9,  approximately 55 percent of nests were found to have  survived at the 82\u00b0N location compared to approximately  10 percent of nest survival at the 63\u00b0N location. This  study provides the first known quantifiable evidence for  the previously unanswered question of why shorebirds  continue on to the high Arctic. 22 The shorebirds risk  their own survival by flying farther. Their offspring have  a better chance of survival because fewer predators  invade the nests.",
