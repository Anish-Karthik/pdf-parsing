  "passage": "\tLate last autumn, Giuseppe Ferrua stood, on the hillside he farms overlooking Italy\u2019s Serchio River valley, a landscape of low mountains dotted with vineyards. Ferrua grows grapes and olives, and he does so according to the phases of the Moon. He didn\u2019t always farm this way. When he began, he exercised modern, one-size-fits-all farming methods but says he soon became convinced that \u201cplants are completely prone to elements in the cosmos, the rhythms of day and night.\u201d\n\tFollowing the lunar calendar, this type of farming is driven by the belief that the Moon influences levels of moisture in the soil, just as the Moon\u2019s gravitational pull affects great bodies of water. Lunar farmers believe,\n\tfor example, that from the new Moon to quarter Moon phases, when the Moon is waxing, a soil\u2019s moisture content increases, whereas drier periods occur during the waning phase. Although moisture influences seed germination, a lunar guide on when to plant and weed can be advantageous to a grower.\n\tNature has been around forever. First-century Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder stated in his Natural History that the Moon \u201creplenishes the Earth; when she approaches it, she fills all bodies, while, when she recedes, she empties them.\u201d Chinese and Egyptian people performed agricultural tasks according to the lunar calendar for millennia, and, to this day, the vaunted Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac includes regional lunar calendars and advice on when to conduct farm chores. The\n\talmanacs editor, Janice Stillman, says, \u201cThat information is of value to our readers who practice these traditional methods\u2014and claim great success.\u201d\n\tLunar farming has its skeptics, who are not sure of the method\u2019s efficacy. Recalling advice he received on the best lunar time to plant potatoes, an English farmer says his first reaction was \u201cHoopla.\u201d Current mainstream agriculture does not factor the Moon into their practices, so the concept might seem quaint or irrational. Additionally, lunar farming is based in astrology as opposed to astronomy, and no extensive scientific studies have yet been conducted that measure the Moon\u2019s overall influence on farming, so supporters continue to wait for their practices to be verified scientifically.\n\tStillman says, \u201cWe are of the mind that you accept or believe by choice.\u201d Indeed, despite his doubts, the skeptical English farmer wound up planting his potatoes according to the lunar cycle and claims they were \u201cthe best I have tasted.\u201d Agricultural professor Jennifer Coffman has a similar response to Ferrua\u2019s bounty in Italy. \u201cSmell this rosemary,\u201d she says. \u201cSmell how amazingly fragrant that is.\u201d At this stage, one could say that the evidence must be experienced to be believed.",
