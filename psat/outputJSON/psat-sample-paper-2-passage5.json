  "passage": "\t\u201cThe bad guy in the story\u2014the western corn  45 rootworm\u2014was actually part of a multi-species  conspiracy,\u201d says Joe Spencer, who was part of the  study.  The team, including graduate student Chia-Ching  Chu, found that a third of the rootworms\u2019 gut  50 bacteria comprise species that are unique to either  the resistant or normal varieties. These two factions  also differ in the relative numbers of the bacteria that  they share.  These different microbes give the resistant beetles  55 an edge when eating soybeans. The rootworms digest  the protein in their meals using enzymes called  cysteine proteases, and soybeans defend themselves  with substances that can block these enzymes.  But Chu found that the more the beetles\u2019 bacteria  60 differed from the normal set, the higher the levels of  cysteine proteases in their guts. By avoiding  indigestion, these beetles were better at surviving  among soybeans, and more likely to lay their eggs  there.  65  The team proved that the bacteria were  responsible by killing them with antibiotics. Sure  enough, this drastically lowered the cysteine protease  activity in the guts of the rotation-resistant beetles  and wrecked their ability to thrive among soybeans.",
