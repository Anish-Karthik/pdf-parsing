  "passage": "\tThis was a time trial, he said\u2014a one-mile time  trial, four laps\u2014not a race. It was meant to give an  idea of where we stood, no more.  Line  We\u2019d gathered around the middle of the long side  5 of the track, just ten or twelve of us, including three  others who seemed new like me, jogging back and  forth in the wind, loosening up. The rest had walked  over to the other side of the field. \n\tFalvo took me aside. \u201cWarmed up? How\u2019re the  10 shoes?\u201d \n\t\u201cFine.\u201d In the distance I could see kids walking  toward the parking lot. The sun stabbed out from  under the clouds, glancing off the windshields. \n\tHe raised his voice over the wind. \u201cAll right, I  15 want you all to stay contained, stay smooth. I don\u2019t  want to see anybody draining the well today\u2014that  means you, Mr. McCann.\u201d A tall, tough-looking kid  with red hair and a tight face smiled like a gunslinger. \n\tHe turned to me. \u201cI don\u2019t want you doing  20 anything stupid, Mosher. Some of these boys have  been at it for a while. Don\u2019t think about them, think  about yourself.\u201d \n\tI shrugged.  \u201cPace yourself. Let them do what they do. They\u2019ll  25 be about thirty yards ahead after the first lap. Don\u2019t  worry about them. Go out slow, feel your way, then  bring it home as best you can. OK?\u201d  \u201cSure,\u201d I said.  \u201cRemember, it\u2019s a time trial. Not a race.\u201d  I don\u2019t know why. I can\u2019t explain it. By the end of  the third lap I was barely moving, clawing at the air,  oblivious to everything except the dirt unfolding  endlessly in front of me. \u201cLet him go,\u201d I heard  65 somebody say. They\u2019d all finished by then, recovered,  and now stood watching as I staggered past them like  something shot. \u201cC\u2019mon... \u201d I  heard someone start  to call out uneasily, and then, \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d  A small crowd, I found out later, sensing something  70 going on, had gathered by the fence to the parking  lot. The last of the newcomers had passed me  long ago.  I remember seeing him appear in front of me like  I was coming up from underwater and trying to  75 swerve but I was barely standing and I walked right  into him and he caught me as I fell, his one good arm  around my back, saying over and over, \u201cAll right,  easy now, easy, you\u2019re done, keep walking, walk it  off,\u201d like he was gentling a horse. I threw up on the  80 infield grass.  \u201cWhat we have here,\u201d he was saying, \u201cis a failure  to communicate. Stay within yourself, I said.  Don't drain the well, I said.\u201d  \u201cWhat did I get?\u201d I couldn\u2019t seem to hold my head  85 up, or open my eyes\u2014the pain kept coming in waves.  \u201cWhat?\u201d  \u201cTime. What time did I get?\u201d  He laughed\u2014that bitter Falvo laugh\u2014ha!\u2014like  he\u2019d just been vindicated. \u201cHe wants to know what  90 he got,\u201d he said, like there was somebody with us.  \u201cYou want to know what you got? I\u2019ll tell you  what you got: proof you could beat yourself  senseless\u2014something I very much doubt you  needed.\u201d  Based on the passage, which character would most  likely agree with the idea that, when trying  something new, it is best not to push one\u2019s limits?  A) Falvo  B) McCann  C) Mosher  D) The person who said \u201cLet him go\u201d  In the context of the passage, \u201cI shrugged\u201d (line 23)  and \u201c\u2018Sure,\u2019 I said\u201d (line 28) mainly serve to show the  narrator\u2019s  A) shyness.  B) dismissiveness.  C) dishonesty.  D) hostility.  Based on the passage, how did the experienced  runners respond to Falvo\u2019s advice?  A) They enthusiastically embraced it.  B) They acted like they hadn\u2019t heard it.  C) They generally accepted it.  D) They only pretended to take it seriously.  Based on the passage, when Falvo says, \u201cDon\u2019t drain  the well\u201d (line 83), he most probably means  A) don\u2019t use up all of your energy.  B) don\u2019t get sick.  C) don\u2019t try to outdo one another.  D) don\u2019t quit before you\u2019re finished.",
