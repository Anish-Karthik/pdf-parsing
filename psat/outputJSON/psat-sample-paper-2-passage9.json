  "passage": "\t[1] It used to be that a move to a metropolis such as  New York City was an inevitable step for aspiring artists.  [2] Back when geography was everything, an artist had to  get her painting, song, poem, or dance in front of as large  an audience as possible. [3] To some degree, these tales  may have been true. [4] That was much easier in a city  with a teeming population. [5] Geographical proximity  helped artists meet other artists, be inspired by them, and  compete with them. [6] Stories of talented, ambitious  young people getting by on \u201cpluck and luck\u201d in the big  city were commonplace. [7] These days, however, they  are more fiction than fact. 34 \n\tToday the United States economy is much less  forgiving. Once 35 an artist could make a living as a  temporary office worker or a waiter, leaving plenty of  time to practice your art. In many of the nation\u2019s largest  cities, 36 therefore, this life is no longer possible. There  are very few cheap, empty lofts waiting to be transformed  with an attitude and a paintbrush. Real estate prices have  skyrocketed, and survival, for all but the luckiest few, has  become more difficult. In many large cities, affordable  theaters, jazz cafes, and art galleries are being replaced by  37 other places, including expensive restaurants, couture  boutiques, and exclusive nightclubs, so there are fewer  and fewer opportunities for the artist just starting out.  When business leaders in New York, for example, go  38 so far as to declare the city a \u201cluxury brand,\u201d they are  not appealing to potential customers who struggle to  survive as artists. \n\tOne exception to this trend 39 is Cleveland, Ohio; a  great place for young artists. Once a center for  manufacturing, Cleveland still boasts a well-maintained  infrastructure though many factories and jobs have  moved overseas. The city is working hard to attract  artists. In 2013 it hosted a \u201cWelcome to Cleveland\u201d  weekend, providing a steep discount for hotels, paying  fully for ground transportation, and offering an array of  meals and free cultural events to artists who were willing  to visit the city and consider 40 moving to Cleveland.  Perhaps the real sign of welcome is Cleveland\u2019s artist  housing plan: homes will be sold to qualifying artists at  prices similar to 41 an economy car. Cleveland may be  doing the most to attract the creative class, but many  other smaller cities, including Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;  Corvallis, Oregon; and Burlington, Vermont, are  following 42 its lead. 43 \n\tIf you\u2019re an artist trying to reach an audience, move  to a place where you can live well and where you are  needed. Don\u2019t 44 undermine smaller cities such as  Cleveland as you search for your place of inspiration.",
