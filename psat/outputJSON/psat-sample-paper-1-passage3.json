The first order of business is to fatten up.\n\t\u201cFat is where it\u2019s at for a hibernator,\u201d says Matthew Andrews, a molecular biologist at the University of Minnesota Duluth who studies 13-lined ground squirrels. \u201cYou bring your own lunch with you.\u201d Packing lunch is necessary because the animals go on the world\u2019s strictest diet during the winter, surviving entirely off their white fat. \u201cThey have their last supper in October; they don\u2019t eat again until March,\u201d Andrews says.\n\tBigger fat stores mean a greater chance of surviving until spring. \u201cIf they go in really chunky, nice and roly-poly, that\u2019s going to be a good hibernator,\u201d he says.",
