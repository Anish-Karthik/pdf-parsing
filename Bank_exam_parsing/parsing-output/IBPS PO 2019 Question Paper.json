For example, if we take the pair \"B\" and \"R,\" there is one letter between them in the word and one letter between them in the alphabet (A is between B and C, and Q is between R and S).\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Pairs of Letters**\n\nTo identify pairs of letters that meet the given condition, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. List all the letters in the word: B-R-I-S-K-L-Y\n2. Compare the distance between each pair of letters in the word and in the alphabet.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying Pairs with the Same Distance**\n\nAfter comparing pairs of letters, we can identify three pairs that have the same distance between them in the word and in the alphabet:\n\n1. B-R (1 letter apart in both word and alphabet)\n2. L-Y (2 letters apart in both word and alphabet)\n3. S-K (3 letters apart in both word and alphabet)\n\n**Step 4: Determining Number of Pairs**\n\nSince we identified three pairs, the correct option is \"Three\".\n\n**Therefore, the correct option is D: Three.**",
