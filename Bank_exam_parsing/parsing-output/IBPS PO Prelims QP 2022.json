So, the tax paid by Mayank in 2018 = 4 \ud835\udc65.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the income of Mayank in 2020.\n\nAs given in the question, his income increased by 25% in 2020 over 2018. Therefore, the income of Mayank in 2020 = 125% * x = 1.25x.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the tax paid by Mayank in 2020.\n\nFrom the question, we know that the ratio of tax paid by Mayank in 2018 to that of in 2020 is 9 : 10. So, if we assume the tax paid in 2018 as 9y, then the tax paid in 2020 would be 10y.\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate the remaining income of Mayank in 2018 after paying tax and rent.\n\nAs per the question, Mayank spent 1 6 \ud835\udc61\u210e of his remaining income on rent in 2018, so remaining after paying tax and rent = (1 - 4 \ud835\udc65 - 1 6 \ud835\udc65) = 11 6 \ud835\udc65.\n\n**Step 5:** Calculate the remaining income of Mayank in 2020 after paying tax and rent.\n\nSimilarly, Mayank spent 25% of his remaining income on rent in 2020, so remaining after paying tax and rent = (1.25x - 10y - 0.25(1.25x - 10y)) = 0.875x - 7.5y.\n\n**Step 6:** Calculate the difference between savings of Mayank in both years.\n\nSavings in 2018 = 11 6 \ud835\udc65\nSavings in 2020 = 0.875x - 7.5y\n\nDifference between savings = 11 6 \ud835\udc65 - (0.875x - 7.5y) = 0.125x + 7.5y\n\n**Step 7:** Substitute the values of x and y.\n\nFrom the given ratio, we know that 9y = 4 \ud835\udc65. So, y = 4 9 \ud835\udc65. Substituting these values, we get:\n\nDifference between savings = 0.125x + 7.5y \n= 0.125x + 7.5*(4 9 \ud835\udc65)\n= 0.125x + 33.33\ud835\udc65\n= 33.455\ud835\udc65\n\n**Step 8:** Calculate the difference.\n\nSince we don't have the exact value of x, we can't find the exact difference. However, we can simplify the expression by taking x as 100:\n\nDifference between savings = 33.455\ud835\udc65\n= 33.455 * 100\n= 3345.5\n\nTherefore, the difference between savings of Mayank in both years is **Rs. 3345.5**.\n\n**The correct option is B: 15000 Rs.**",

In this case, the shortest distance between points X and N is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 7m and 117m.

So, this is a wrong combination.\n* **A - 47:** The position of 'A' in the alphabet is 1. 47 is double of 23.5. So, this is a wrong combination.\n* **H - 29:** The position of 'H' in the alphabet is 8. 29 is slightly less than the double of 14.5. So, this is a wrong combination.\n* **M - 43:** The position of 'M' in the alphabet is 13. 43 is double of 21.5. So, this is a correct combination.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nSince only one option, **M - 43**, is correct, the correct option is **All are correct** (option C).\n\n**Reason for the Correct Option:**\n\nAll the other options, except M - 43, are incorrect. Therefore, the only correct option is the one that includes M - 43, which is **All are correct**.",
