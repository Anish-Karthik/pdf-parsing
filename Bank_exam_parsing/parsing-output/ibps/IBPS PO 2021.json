For example, a person who is only interested in the superficial aspects of life, such as wealth and status, is said to be superficial.\n\n**Frivolous:**\nThe word \"frivolous\" comes from the Latin word \"frivolus\", which means \"worthless\" or \"trivial\". It refers to something that is not serious or important, and that is often done for amusement or recreation. For example, a frivolous person is someone who is always joking around and not taking things seriously.\n\n**Trivial:**\nThe word \"trivial\" comes from the Latin word \"trivialis\", which means \"commonplace\" or \"unimportant\".
