Price differences can worsen economic inequality, especially for women in lower-income households.\n\n**Explanation:** \n\nGender-based pricing, the practice of charging different prices to consumers based on their gender, has a disproportionate impact on women, particularly those in lower-income households. \n\n* **Economic inequality:** \nGender-based pricing contributes to economic inequality by placing an additional financial burden on women. \nWhen women are charged more for similar products and services, they have less disposable income for essential expenses such as housing, food, and healthcare. \nOver time, these price differences can accumulate and exacerbate the economic disparities between men and women. \n\n* **Discrimination and exploitation:** \nGender-based pricing is often rooted in discriminatory assumptions about the value of women's time and resources.\nBy charging women more, businesses perpetuate the idea that women's needs are less important and that they are willing to pay more for the same products and services. \nThis can lead to feelings of resentment and exploitation among women. \n\nIn contrast, the other options:\n\n- **A** is incorrect because increased profits may not necessarily lead to societal advancement, and gender-based pricing can actually hinder progress by perpetuating inequality.\n\n- **B** is incorrect because gender-based pricing is not a just pricing approach and does not promote a sense of superiority among men.\n\n- **D** is incorrect because the quality of men's and women's products does not necessarily differ based on price, and gender-based pricing can actually lead to women paying more for lower-quality products.\n\n- **E** is incorrect because gender-based pricing creates conflict primarily between women and businesses, rather than between women of different income levels.",

Then, we have:\n\n```\nx/y = 3/1\n```\n\nThis means that there were three times as many males as females who purchased all articles.\n\nLet's also assume that m males and f females purchased article A in June. Then, we have:\n\n```\nm/f = 1/2\n```\n\nThis means that there were half as many males as females who purchased article A.\n\nWe know that 10 females purchased article C in June. Let's assume that t females purchased article B in June. Then, we have:\n\n```\nt = y - 10\n```\n\nThis means that the number of females who purchased article B is equal to the total number of females who purchased all articles minus the number of females who purchased article C.\n\nNow, we can use the given ratios to solve for the number of males who purchased article B.\n\n```\nx/y = 3/1\n```\n\n```\nm/f = 1/2\n```\n\n```\nt = y - 10\n```\n\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n\n```\nf = 2m\n```\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n```\nx/(2m) = 3/1\n```\n\n```\nx = 6m\n```\n\nSubstituting this into the third equation, we get:\n\n```\nt = y - 10\n```\n\n```\nt = 2m - 10\n```\n\nTherefore, the number of males who purchased article B in June is **2m - 10**.\n\n**Step 3: Check the answer**\n\nWe can check our answer by plugging it back into the given ratios.\n\n```\nx/y = 3/1\n```\n\n```\n(6m)/y = 3/1\n```\n\n```\n6m = 3y\n```\n\n```\nm/f = 1/2\n```\n\n```\nm/(2m) = 1/2\n```\n\n```\nm = 2m\n```\n\n```\nt = y - 10\n```\n\n```\n(2m - 10) = y - 10\n```\n\n```\n2m = y\n```\n\nAll the ratios check out, so our answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of males who purchased article B in June is **2m - 10**.

We need to find that point.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the options**\n\nThe given options are:\n\n* Q\n* U\n* W\n* X\n* None of these\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the options**\n\nWe can eliminate option E since it is not a valid point.\n\nNow, let's examine the remaining options:\n\n* Q is two steps below R.\n* U is three steps below R.\n* W is four steps below R.\n* X is five steps below R.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the correct option**\n\nWe need to find the point that is twice the distance away from R as the distance between R and Y.\n\nSince R to Y is two steps, we need a point that is four steps below R.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is **C: W**.\n\n**Step 5: Explain the reasoning**\n\nThe number of persons living between R and Y is 2 (R, Y).\n\nThe number of persons living below W is 4 (U, Q, R, W).\n\nTherefore, the number of persons living between R and Y is half the number of persons living below W, which is the given statement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C: W.",

The options are 'V', 'T', 'S', 'W', and 'Q'.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the Options**\n\nLet's examine each option carefully:\n\n* 'V' is a consonant.\n* 'T' is a consonant.\n* 'S' is a consonant.\n* 'W' is a consonant.\n* 'Q' is a consonant.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Common Feature**\n\nAll five options are consonants. They are all letters that represent sounds produced without vocal cord vibrations. This suggests that all options belong to the same group.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Odd Option**\n\nSince all the options are consonants, there is no odd option based on the given information. All five options (V, T, S, W, Q) form a group of consonants.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe problem does not provide sufficient information to identify an odd option. All five options (V, T, S, W, Q) belong to the group of consonants. Therefore, no correct option can be determined.",
