Let's represent it as A.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Relationship Between Parks A and C**\n\nThe question mentions that the total females visited park A are 255 more than the total children visited park C. This means:\n\n```\nF = C + 255\n```\n\n**Step 2: Solve for F**\n\nWe can solve the above equation to find the value of F:\n\n```\nF - C = 255\n```\n\n**Step 3: Relate F to A**\n\nWe know that the total females visited park A is F. But since the question asks for the total children visited park A, we need to find the relationship between F and A.\n\nIn general, the total number of people visiting a park includes both children and adults (including females). Let's assume the total people visited park A is X. Then, we have:\n\n```\nX = A + F\n```\n\n**Step 4: Substitute F and Solve for A**\n\nSubstituting the value of F from Step 2, we get:\n\n```\nX = A + (C + 255)\n```\n\nWe need to find A, which is the total children visited park A. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n```\nA = X - (C + 255)\n```\n\nWe do not have the value of X or C in the given question. Therefore, we cannot find the exact value of A.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot determine the total children visited park A.

It is given that four out of the five options are alike in a certain way.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n* **O-L:** L is 2 positions after O in the alphabet.\n* **K-R:** R is 2 positions after K in the alphabet.\n* **L-N:** N is 2 positions after L in the alphabet.\n* **M-Q:** Q is 2 positions after M in the alphabet.\n* **Q-S:** S is not 2 positions after Q in the alphabet.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Odd One Out**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can see that all the options except **Q-S** follow the rule that the second letter is 2 positions after the first letter in the alphabet. Therefore, **Q-S** does not belong to the group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct option is **E** (Q-S), as it does not follow the pattern of the other options.",
