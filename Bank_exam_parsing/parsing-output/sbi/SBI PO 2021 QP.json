Unions are typically organizations that represent the interests of workers. The new owners are the people who have recently acquired ownership of the company.\n\nThe blank spaces in the question are asking for two words that describe the relationship between the unions and the new owners. The first word is a verb that describes what the unions did or said. The second word is a noun that describes the attitude or feeling that the unions have towards the new owners.\n\nThe correct answer, 'assured, loyalty', fits both of these requirements. The verb 'assured' means to give someone confidence or certainty about something. In this case, the unions are giving the new owners confidence about the loyalty of the workers. The noun 'loyalty' means the feeling of faithfulness and devotion to a person or cause. In this case, the unions are expressing their loyalty to the new owners.\n\nThe other options do not fit both of these requirements. For example, 'exempted, allegiance' does not make sense because 'exempted' means to free someone from an obligation, while 'allegiance' means loyalty. These two words are contradictory, so they cannot both be used to describe the relationship between the unions and the new owners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 'assured, loyalty'.",

The options provided are: P, L, S, O, and None of these.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Options**\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n* **P:** If the number of people born between P and S is the same as the number of people born between N and S, then P must be before N.\n* **L:** If the number of people born between L and S is the same as the number of people born between N and S, then L must be after S.\n* **S:** The question is about people born after S, so S itself cannot be the answer.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Correct Option**\n\nBy eliminating the incorrect options, we are left with only one option that satisfies the condition: P.\n\n**Reason:**\n\nThe number of people born between P and S will be the same as the number of people born between N and S only if P is before N. In this case, the number of people born after P will be equal to the number of people born between N and S.\n\n**Therefore, the correct option is A: P.**",
