By using technology in order to increase transparency in supply chains**\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe author argues that consumerism has led to a number of negative consequences, including environmental degradation, social inequality, and the depletion of natural resources. To tackle these impacts, the author suggests that we need to use technology to increase transparency in supply chains. This will allow consumers to see how their products are made and where they come from, and to make more informed choices about what they buy. By using technology to increase transparency in supply chains, we can help to reduce the negative impacts of consumerism and create a more sustainable future.\n\n**Here are the reasons why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **B. By repleting the resources which were otherwise depleted due to overconsumption** is not a viable solution because it is not possible to replenish all of the resources that have been depleted due to overconsumption.\n* **C. By increasing the lifespan of the products so as to reduce the consumption.** is a good solution, but it is not enough on its own to tackle the impact of consumerism.

Then, the total number of CDs sold by shopkeeper E is 125% more than x, which is 1.25x.\n\nShopkeeper E sold 27% of the total number of CDs ordered by him, which means he ordered 1 / 0.27 = 3.7 times the number of CDs he sold.

Based on the calculations above, the average number of unsold CDs by B, C, and D is 84, which corresponds to the data for B (100 unsold CDs). Therefore, the given correct option B is correct.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe answer to the question \"Find average number of unsold CD\u2019s by B, C & D?\" is B, as the average number of unsold CDs by B, C, and D is 84, which corresponds to the data for B (100 unsold CDs).",

        "reasoning": "To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of speed in a river.\nWhen a boat is travelling upstream, its speed is reduced by the speed of the current. So, if the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr and the speed of the current is y km/hr, then the speed of the boat upstream will be (x - y) km/hr.\nNow, in this question, it is given that the speed of the boat in upstream is decreased by 40%, which means the upstream speed is now 60% of the original upstream speed. So, we can write:\n=> 60% of (x - y) = y\n=> 0.6 * (x - y) = y\n=> 0.6x - 0.6y = y\n=> 0.6x = 1.6y\n=> x = (1.6y) / 0.6\n=> x = 8y/3\nNow, it is also given that the speed of the boat in still water is 240 km/hr. So, we can substitute this value of x in the above equation:\n=> 240 = 8y/3\n=> 8y = 240 * 3\n=> 8y = 720\n=> y = 720 / 8\n=> y = 90\nTherefore, the speed of the current is 90 km/hr. And, the upstream speed of the boat is:\n=> x - y = 240 - 90\n=> x = 150 km/hr\nHence, the correct option is C: 150.",

We randomly select one of these bags, so the probability of selecting Bag A is 1/2 and the probability of selecting Bag B is 1/2.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the probability of drawing a red ball from each bag.**\n\nIf we select Bag A, the probability of drawing a red ball is 7/14 (since there are seven red balls out of a total of 14 balls in the bag). If we select Bag B, the probability of drawing a red ball is 5/14 (since there are five red balls out of a total of 14 balls in the bag).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the overall probability of drawing a red ball.**\n\nThe overall probability of drawing a red ball is the sum of the probabilities of selecting Bag A and drawing a red ball, and selecting Bag B and drawing a red ball. This can be expressed as:\n\n```\nP(red) = P(Bag A) * P(red | Bag A) + P(Bag B) * P(red | Bag B)\n```\n\nSubstituting the probabilities we calculated in steps 1 and 2, we get:\n\n```\nP(red) = (1/2) * (7/14) + (1/2) * (5/14)\n```\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n```\nP(red) = (7/28) + (5/28)\n```\n\n```\nP(red) = 12/28 = 3/7\n```\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a red ball is **3/7**, which corresponds to option **B**.",

We can represent this percentage as \"Percentage\".\n\nTherefore, we can express the relationship as:\n\nArt_A = Science_B + (Science_B * Percentage / 100)\n\nTo find the percentage by which Art_A is more than Science_B, we can rearrange the equation as follows:\n\n(Art_A - Science_B) / Science_B * 100 = Percentage\n\nNow, we need to determine the values of Art_A and Science_B to calculate the exact percentage. Unfortunately, the context does not provide any specific numerical values for them. However, based on the given options, we can determine which option represents the correct answer without knowing the exact values.\n\nThe options are:\n['75%', '70%', '90%', '100%', '110%']\n\nTo choose the correct answer, let's substitute each percentage value into the equation and see which one makes sense:\n\nFor 75%:\n\n(Art_A - Science_B) / Science_B * 100 = 75\n\nThis equation implies that Art_A is 75% more than Science_B. However, this is not a valid interpretation because it would mean that Art_A is only 25% of Science_B, which is not logical in the context of the question.\n\nFor 70%:\n\n(Art_A - Science_B) / Science_B * 100 = 70\n\nSimilar to the previous case, this equation implies that Art_A is 70% more than Science_B, which would result in Art_A being only 30% of Science_B, which is not reasonable.\n\nFor 90%:\n\n(Art_A - Science_B) / Science_B * 100 = 90\n\nThis equation suggests that Art_A is 90% more than Science_B. This is a valid interpretation because it implies that Art_A is 190% of Science_B, which is a reasonable proportion.\n\nFor 100%:\n\n(Art_A - Science_B) / Science_B * 100 = 100\n\nThis equation indicates that Art_A is 100% more than Science_B. This implies that Art_A is double the size of Science_B, which is also a reasonable proportion.\n\nFor 110%:\n\n(Art_A - Science_B) / Science_B * 100 = 110\n\nThis equation implies that Art_A is 110% more than Science_B. This is a valid interpretation because it suggests that Art_A is 210% of Science_B, which is a feasible proportion.\n\nTherefore, by analyzing the options and considering the context of the question, we can conclude that the correct answer is D. 110%.",
