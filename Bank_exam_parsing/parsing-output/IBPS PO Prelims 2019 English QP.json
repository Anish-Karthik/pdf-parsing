The sentence is about the obligations of different parties in the event that a flight is cancelled.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the different parts of the sentence.**\n\nThe sentence is divided into two parts by the conjunction \"if\".

The first part of the sentence is the condition, and the second part of the sentence is the result.

In this case, the correct option is D, which means that if the obliged are alternative, the authorities are flights to provide compensation or an cancelled.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe obliged parties are the parties who are responsible for providing compensation or an alternative flight in the event that a flight is cancelled. If the obliged parties are alternative, then it means that they are not the same party. This means that the authorities must take action to ensure that the passengers receive the compensation or alternative flight that they are entitled to.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the relationship between the different parts of the sentence.

Option B is incorrect because it does not specify that the obliged parties are alternative.
