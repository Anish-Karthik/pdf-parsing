Reduced emissions from manufacturing and energy sectors:** This option could be a factor, but it's not the primary reason for the decrease in 2020.\n\n**B. The introduction of global policy over capping greenhouse gas emission by 30%:** This is not mentioned in the passage.\n\n**C. Global mobility restrictions and economic activity declination due to lockdown:** This is a plausible reason. Lockdowns and economic slowdown led to reduced travel, transportation, and industrial activity, resulting in lower emissions.\n\n**D. Increased use of renewable energy sources:** This could contribute to overall emissions reduction, but it's not the main reason for the decrease in 2020.\n\n**E. The emergence of the Climate Change:** This is not relevant to the immediate decrease in emissions in 2020.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Correct Option**\n\nThe correct option is **C. Global mobility restrictions and economic activity declination due to lockdown**. This aligns with the passage, which states that \"global mobility and economic activity declined due to lockdowns implemented to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.\" These restrictions significantly reduced transportation and industrial emissions, leading to a temporary decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in 2020.",

It reduces the risk of severe climate impacts.**\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has stated that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels is crucial to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. This is because:\n\n* **Reduces the risk of extreme weather events:** A 1.5 degree Celsius limit would reduce the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, and storms.\n* **Protects ecosystems:** Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would help to preserve ecosystems and biodiversity, reducing the risk of extinction and species loss.\n* **Safeguards human health:** Extreme weather events, air pollution, and other climate-related impacts can harm human health. A 1.5 degree Celsius limit would reduce these risks.\n* **Limits sea level rise:** Warming oceans cause sea levels to rise, threatening coastal communities and infrastructure. A 1.5 degree Celsius limit would slow down sea level rise and reduce its impacts.\n\nIn contrast, the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **A. It prevents all climate-related changes:** Even a 1.5 degree Celsius limit will not completely eliminate climate-related changes. However, it will significantly reduce the risks and impacts.\n* **B. It ensures immediate reductions in emissions:** While limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius requires rapid reductions in emissions, it does not ensure that reductions will happen immediately.\n* **C. It avoids the need for future climate action:** Even with a 1.5 degree Celsius limit, future climate action will still be necessary to address the long-term impacts of climate change.\n* **E. It guarantees economic growth:** Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is not a guarantee of economic growth, but it can help to create a more sustainable economy that is less vulnerable to climate risks.",

The passage emphasizes the need for urgent action to reduce emissions to mitigate the effects of climate change.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because they contradict the passage's overall message.

This means that for every 4 males working in public companies from city C, there are 5 females working in private companies from city B.\n\nLet's also assume that the number of females working in public companies from city B is 100. This means that there are 100 females working in public companies from city B.\n\nTo find the percentage of males working in public companies from city A, we need to divide the number of females working in public companies from city B by the number of males working in public companies from city C and then multiply by 100.\n\n```\nPercentage of males working in public companies from city A = (Number of females working in public companies from city B / Number of males working in public companies from city C) * 100\n```\n\n```\nPercentage of males working in public companies from city A = (100 / 4) * 100\n```\n\n```\nPercentage of males working in public companies from city A = 25 * 100\n```\n\n```\nPercentage of males working in public companies from city A = 2500%\n```\n\n**Step 3: Answer the question**\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of males working in public companies from city A.

Therefore, the number of male employees in F is:\n```\nMale employees in F = Average - Male employees in C\nMale employees in F = 200 - 200\nMale employees in F = 0\n```\n\n* **Calculate the number of female employees in F:** Since 80% of the total employees in F are females, the number of female employees in F is:\n```\nFemale employees in F = 80% * x\nFemale employees in F = 0.8 * x\n```\n\n* **Calculate the total number of employees in F:**\n```\nTotal employees in F = Male employees in F + Female employees in F\nTotal employees in F = 0 + 0.8 * x\nTotal employees in F = 0.8 * x\n```\n\n* **Calculate the difference as a percentage of 100y:**\n```\nDifference = (Total employees in F - 100y) / 100y * 100 %\nDifference = ((0.8 * x) - 100y) / 100y * 100 %\n```\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Options**\n\nTo determine the correct option, we can substitute different values of y and calculate the difference.\n\n* For option A (360), the difference is:\n```\nDifference = ((0.8 * x) - 100 * 360) / 100 * 360 * 100 %\nDifference = ((0.8 * x) - 36000) / 36000 * 100 %\n```\n\n* For option B (400), the difference is:\n```\nDifference = ((0.8 * x) - 100 * 400) / 100 * 400 * 100 %\nDifference = ((0.8 * x) - 40000) / 40000 * 100 %\n```\n\n* For option C (410), the difference is:\n```\nDifference = ((0.8 * x) - 100 * 410) / 100 * 410 * 100 %\nDifference = ((0.8 * x) - 41000) / 41000 * 100 %\n```\n\n* For option D (430), the difference is:\n```\nDifference = ((0.8 * x) - 100 * 430) / 100 * 430 * 100 %\nDifference = ((0.8 * x) - 43000) / 43000 * 100 %\n```\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Correct Option**\n\nWe can see that for option D (430), the difference is 0. This means that the total number of employees in F is exactly 100y. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Hence, the correct option is D (430).**",

Let's assume the amount of water in the initial mixture is x liters. Then, the amount of milk in the initial mixture is 1.5x liters.\n\n**Step 2: Find the total amount of milk and water in the initial mixture.**\n\nTotal amount = Milk + Water = 1.5x + x = 2.5x liters\n\nGiven that the total volume of the mixture is 79.99 liters, we have:\n2.5x = 79.99\nx = 32 liters\n\nTherefore, the amount of water in the initial mixture is 32 liters, and the amount of milk is 1.5x = 48 liters.\n\n**Step 3: Find the amount of milk and water removed.**\n\n20.03 liters of the mixture is taken out. Since the mixture contains 50% more milk than water, the amount of milk removed is 1.5 times the amount of water removed.\n\nLet's assume the amount of water removed is y liters. Then, the amount of milk removed is 1.5y liters.\n\nTotal amount removed = Milk removed + Water removed = 1.5y + y = 2.5y liters\n\nGiven that 20.03 liters of the mixture is taken out, we have:\n2.5y = 20.03\ny = 8.012 liters\n\nTherefore, the amount of water removed is 8.012 liters, and the amount of milk removed is 1.5y = 12.018 liters.\n\n**Step 4: Find the amount of milk and water added.**\n\n59.99 liters of mixture of milk and water is added to the remaining mixture. Let's assume the amount of water added is a liters. Then, the amount of milk added is 1.5a liters.\n\nTotal amount added = Milk added + Water added = 1.5a + a = 2.5a liters\n\nGiven that the total volume of the mixture after adding is 79.99 liters, we have:\n2.5a = 59.99\na = 24 liters\n\nTherefore, the amount of water added is 24 liters, and the amount of milk added is 1.5a = 36 liters.\n\n**Step 5: Find the amount of milk and water in the resultant mixture.**\n\nAmount of milk in the resultant mixture = Initial milk + Milk added - Milk removed = 48 + 36 - 12.018 = 71.982 liters\n\nAmount of water in the resultant mixture = Initial water + Water added - Water removed = 32 + 24 - 8.012 = 47.988 liters\n\n**Step 6: Check if the milk is two times of the water in the resultant mixture.**\n\nRatio of milk to water = Milk / Water = 71.982 / 47.988 = 1.5\n\nSince the ratio of milk to water is 1.5, the milk is indeed two times of the water in the resultant mixture.\n\n**Step 7: Find the approximate quantity of water added.**\n\nThe given options are (a)32, (b)44, (c)16, (d)30, (e)28.
