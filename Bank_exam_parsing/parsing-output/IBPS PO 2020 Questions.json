This barrier can arise due to a number of factors, including:\n\n* **Lack of training or expertise:** Teachers may not have the necessary skills or training to effectively use educational technology in their classrooms. This can lead to uncertainty and discomfort with implementing technology-based lesson plans.\n* **Established teaching practices:** Teachers may be accustomed to traditional teaching methods and reluctant to change their established routines. Introducing technology can disrupt their comfort zone and require significant effort to adapt.\n* **Concerns about effectiveness:** Some teachers may question the effectiveness of educational technology and hesitate to adopt it if they believe it will not enhance student learning.\n* **Resistance to change:** As with any major change, teachers may be resistant to adopting new technologies due to the perceived effort and potential disruption it could bring to their teaching practices.\n\nOvercoming this barrier requires providing adequate training and support for teachers, addressing their concerns, and demonstrating the benefits of educational technology in improving student learning outcomes.",

Removal of Physical Textbooks:**\nTechnology enables students to access digital textbooks and online learning resources, eliminating the need for expensive physical books. This can significantly reduce textbook costs.\n\n**II. Removal of Transportation Charges:**\nOnline learning platforms allow students to study from home or remote locations, removing the need to travel to physical classrooms or libraries. This can eliminate transportation expenses such as fuel, public transportation, or parking fees.\n\n**III. Most of the Academic Journals are Free for Students:**\nMany academic journals are now available online and are free to access for students. This eliminates the need for expensive subscriptions or library fees for accessing research materials.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nAll three options contribute to reducing the cost of learning by eliminating traditional expenses associated with physical textbooks, transportation, and academic resources.

This does not necessarily imply that the action or statement occurs regularly or frequently. Hence, \"repeating\" is not a suitable replacement for \"FREQUENTLY\".\n\n**Option B: Regularly**\n\n\"Regularly\" means to do or occur at fixed intervals or in a consistent pattern. This is the most suitable replacement for \"FREQUENTLY\" as it implies that the action or statement occurs on a regular basis.\n\n**Option C: Habit**\n\n\"Habit\" refers to a regular or customary practice or behavior. While \"habit\" implies a frequent occurrence, it does not necessarily specify the time interval between occurrences. Hence, \"habit\" is not as suitable a replacement for \"FREQUENTLY\" as \"regularly\".\n\n**Option D: Casually**\n\n\"Casually\" means in an informal or relaxed manner. It does not imply a specific frequency of occurrence and is therefore not a suitable replacement for \"FREQUENTLY\".\n\n**Option E: Occasionally**\n\n\"Occasionally\" means happening or occurring only from time to time or infrequently. This is the opposite of \"FREQUENTLY\" and hence not a suitable replacement.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is **B: Regularly**.
