It also states that the total postgraduate population in city B is equal to the total population of city A. The question asks us to find the ratio of the non-postgraduate population in city B to that of city C.\n\n**Step 2: Solve the problem**\n\nLet's assume that the total population of city A is X.\n\nAccording to the given information, the total postgraduate population in city B is also X.\n\nLet's assume that the total population of city C is Y.\n\nSince the ratio of postgraduate population in cities B and C is 7:8, the total postgraduate population in city C can be expressed as (8/7) * X.\n\nTherefore, the total non-postgraduate population in city B is X - (8/7) * X = (7/7) * X.\n\nThe total non-postgraduate population in city C is Y - (8/7) * X.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the non-postgraduate population in city B to that of city C is:\n\n= [(7/7) * X] / [Y - (8/7) * X]\n\n= [X / (Y - (8/7) * X)]\n\n= X / (7Y - 8X) / 7\n\n= X / (7Y - 8X)\n\n**Step 3: Check if the given option is correct**\n\nThe given correct option is '3:1'.
