  "passage": "\tDirection for Reading Comprehension: The passages given here are followed by some questions that have four answer choices; read the passage carefully and pick the option whose answer best aligns with the passage.\n\tStarting in 1957, [Noam Chomsky] proclaimed a new doctrine: Language, that most human of all attributes, was innate. The grammatical faculty was built into the infant brain, and your average 3-year-old was not a mere apprentice in the great enterprise of absorbing English from his or her parents, but a \u201clinguistic genius.\u201d Since this message was couched in terms of Chomskyan theoretical linguistics, in discourse so opaque that it was nearly incomprehensible even to some scholars, many people did not hear it. Now, in a brilliant, witty and altogether satisfying book, Mr. Chomsky's colleague Steven Pinker... has brought Mr. Chomsky's findings to everyman. In \u201cThe Language Instinct\u201d he has gathered persuasive data from such diverse fields as cognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology and speech therapy to make his points, and when he disagrees with Mr. Chomsky he tells you so....\n\tFor Mr. Chomsky and Mr. Pinker, somewhere in the human brain there is a complex set of neural circuits that have been programmed with \u201csuper-rules\u201d (making up what Mr.\n\tChomsky calls \u201cuniversal grammar\u201d), and that these rules are unconscious and instinctive. A half-century ago, this would have been pooh-poohed as a \u201cblack box\u201d theory, since one could not actually pinpoint this grammatical faculty in a specific part of the brain, or describe its functioning. But now things are different. Neurosurgeons [have now found that this] \u201cblackbox\u201d is situated in and around Broca\u2019s area, on the left side of the forebrain....\n\tUnlike Mr. Chomsky, Mr. Pinker firmly places the wiring of the brain for language within the framework of Darwinian natural selection and evolution. He effectively disposes of all claims that intelligent nonhuman primates like chimps have any abilities to learn and use language.\n\tItis not that chimps lack the vocal apparatus to speak; it is just that their brains are unable to produce or use grammar. On the other hand, the \u201clanguage instinct,\u201d when it first appeared among our most distant hominid ancestors, must have given them a selective reproductive advantage over their competitors (including the ancestral chimps)....\n\tSo according to Mr. Pinker, the roots of language must be in the genes, but there cannot be a \u201cgrammar gene\u201d any more than there can be a gene for the heart or any other complex body structure. This proposition will undoubtedly raise the hackles of some behavioural psychologists and anthropologists, for it apparently contradicts the liberal idea that human behavior may be changed for the better by improvements in culture and environment, and it might seem to invite the twin bugaboos of biological determinism and racism. Yet Mr.\n\tPinker stresses one point that should allay such fears. Even though there are 4,000 to 6,000languages today, they are all sufficiently alike to be considered one language by an extraterrestrial observer. In other words, most of the diversity of the world\u2019s cultures, so beloved to anthropologists, is superficial and minor compared to the similarities. Racial differences are literally only \u201cskin deep.\u201d The fundamental unity of humanity is the theme of Mr. Chomsky's universal grammar, and of this exciting book.",
