The answer, in brief, revolves around this conflation, not only by profit- motivated marketers but by a wide variety of interest groups. While abundant historical records have allowed the study of how tea itself moved from east to west, Rappaport is focused on the movement of the idea of tea to suit particular purposes.\n\tBeginning in the 1700s, the temperance movement advocated for tea as a pleasure that cheered but did not inebriate, and industrialists soon borrowed this moral argument in advancing their case for free trade in tea (and hence more open markets for their textiles).\n\tFactory owners joined in, compelled by the cause of a sober workforce, while Christian missionaries discovered that tea \u201cwould soothe any colonial encounter\u201d. During the Second World War, tea service was presented as a social and patriotic activity that uplifted soldiers and calmed refugees.\n\tBut it was tea\u2019s consumer-directed marketing by importers and retailers \u2013 and later by brands\u2013 that most closely portends current trade debates. An early version of the \u201cfarm to table\u201d movement was sparked by anti-Chinese sentiment and concerns over trade deficits, as well as by the reality and threat of adulterated tea containing dirt and hedge clippings.\n\tLipton was soon advertising \u201cfrom the Garden to Tea Cup\u201d supply chains originating in British India and supervised by \u201ceducated Englishmen\u201d. While tea marketing always presented direct consumer benefits (health, energy, relaxation), tea drinkers were also assured that they were participating in a larger noble project that advanced the causes of family, nation and civilization....\n\tRappaport\u2019s treatment of her subject is refreshingly apolitical. Indeed, it is a virtue that readers will be unable to guess her political orientation: both the miracle of markets and capitalism\u2019s dark underbelly are evident in tea\u2019s complex story, as are the complicated effects of British colonialism.... Commodity histories are now themselves commodities: recent works investigate cotton, salt, cod, sugar, chocolate, paper and milk. And morality marketing is now a commodity as well, applied to food, \u201cfair trade\u201d apparel and eco- tourism. Yet tea is, Rappaport makes clear, a world apart \u2013 an astonishing success story in which tea marketers not only succeeded in conveying a sense of moral elevation to the consumer but also arguably did advance the cause of civilisation and community.\n\tI have been offered tea at a British garden party, a Bedouin campfire, a Turkish carpet shop and a Japanese chashitsu, to name a few settings. In each case the offering was more an idea \u2013 friendship, community, respect \u2013 than a drink, and in each case the idea then created a reality. It is not a stretch to say that tea marketers have advanced the particularly noble cause of human dialogue and friendship.",
