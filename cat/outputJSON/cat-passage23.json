  "passage": "\tAs software improves, the people using it become less likely to sharpen their own know-how.\n\tApplications that offer lots of prompts and tips are often to blame; simpler, less solicitous programs push people harder to think, act and learn.\n\tTen years ago, information scientists at Utrecht University in the Netherlands had a group of people carry out complicated analytical and planning tasks using either rudimentary software that provided no assistance or sophisticated software that offered a great deal of aid. The researchers found that the people using the simple software developed better strategies, made fewer mistakes and developed a deeper aptitude for the work. The people using the more advanced software, meanwhile, would often \u201caimlessly click around\u201d when confronted with a tricky problem. The supposedly helpful software actually short-circuited their thinking and learning.\n\t[According to] philosopher Hubert Dreyfus.... our skills get sharper only through practice, when we use them regularly to overcome different sorts of difficult challenges. The goal of modern software, by contrast, is to ease our way through such challenges. Arduous, painstaking work is exactly what programmers are most eager to automate\u2014after all, that is where the immediate efficiency gains tend to lie. In other words, a fundamental tension ripples between the interests of the people doing the automation and the interests of the people doing the work.\n\tNevertheless, automation\u2019s scope continues to widen. With the rise of electronic health records, physicians increasingly rely on software templates to guide them through patient exams. The programs incorporate valuable checklists and alerts, but they also make medicine more routinized and formulaic\u2014and distance doctors from their patients.... Harvard Medical School professor Beth Lown, in a 2012 journal article... warned that when doctors become \u201cscreen-driven,\u201d following a computer\u2019s prompts rather than \u201cthe patient\u2019s narrative thread,\u201d their thinking can become constricted. In the worst cases, they may miss important diagnostic signals....\n\tIn a recent paper published in the journal Diagnosis, three medical researchers... examined the misdiagnosis of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to die of Ebola in the U.S., at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. They argue that the digital templates used by the hospital\u2019s clinicians to record patient information probably helped to induce a kind of tunnel vision. \u201cThese highly constrained tools,\u201d the researchers write, \u201care optimized for data capture but at the expense of sacrificing their utility for appropriate triage and diagnosis, leading users to miss the forest for the trees.\u201d Medical software, they write, is no \u201creplacement for basic history-taking, examination skills, and critical thinking.\u201d...\n\tThere is an alternative. In \u201chuman-centered automation,\u201d the talents of people take precedence.... In this model, software plays an essential but secondary role. It takes over routine functions that a human operator has already mastered, issues alerts when unexpected situations arise, provides fresh information that expands the operator\u2019s perspective and counters the biases that often distort human thinking. The technology becomes the expert\u2019s partner, not the expert\u2019s replacement.",
