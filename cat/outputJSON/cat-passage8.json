  "passage": "\tDirection for Reading Comprehension: The passages given here are followed by some questions that have four answer choices; read the passage carefully and pick the option whose answer best aligns with the passage.\n\tIt has been said that knowledge, or the problem of knowledge, is the scandal of philosophy.\n\tThe scandal is philosophy\u2019s apparent inability to show how, when and why we can be sure that we know something or, indeed, that we know anything. Philosopher Michael Williams writes: \u2018Is it possible to obtain knowledge at all? This problem is pressing because there are powerful arguments, some very ancient, for the conclusion that it is not... Scepticism is the skeleton in Western rationalism\u2019s closet\u2019. While it is not clear that the scandal matters to anyone but philosophers, philosophers point out that it should matter to everyone, at least given a certain conception of knowledge. For, they explain, unless we can ground our claims to knowledge as such, which is to say, distinguish it from mere opinion, superstition, fantasy, wishful thinking, ideology, illusion or delusion, then the actions we take on the basis of presumed knowledge \u2013boarding an airplane, swallowing a pill, finding someone guilty of a crime \u2013 will be irrational and unjustifiable.\n\tThat is all quite serious-sounding but so also are the rattlings of the skeleton: that is, the sceptic\u2019s contention that we cannot be sure that we know anything \u2013 at least not if we think of knowledge as something like having a correct mental representation of reality, and not if we think of reality as something like things-as-they-are-in-themselves, independent of our perceptions, ideas or descriptions. For, the sceptic will note, since reality, under that conception of it, is outside our ken (we cannot catch a glimpse of things-in-themselves around the corner of our own eyes; we cannot form an idea of reality that floats above the processes of our conceiving it), we have no way to compare our mental representations with things-as-they-are-in-themselves and therefore no way to determine whether they are correct or incorrect. Thus the sceptic may repeat (rattling loudly), you cannot be sure you \u2018know\u2019 something or anything at all \u2013 at least not, he may add (rattling softly before disappearing), if that is the way you conceive \u2018knowledge\u2019.\n\tThere are a number of ways to handle this situation. The most common is to ignore it. Most people outside the academy \u2013 and, indeed, most of us inside it \u2013 are unaware of or unperturbed by the philosophical scandal of knowledge and go about our lives without too many epistemic anxieties. We hold our beliefs and presumptive knowledges more or less confidently, usually depending on how we acquired them (I saw it with my own eyes; I heard it on Fox News; a guy at the office told me) and how broadly and strenuously they seem to be shared or endorsed by various relevant people: experts and authorities, friends and family members, colleagues and associates. And we examine our convictions more or less closely, explain them more or less extensively, and defend them more or less vigorously, usually depending on what seems to be at stake for ourselves and/or other people and what resources are available for reassuring ourselves or making our beliefs credible to others (look, it\u2019s right here on the page; add up the figures yourself; I happen to be a heart specialist).",
