During the original marshmallow test, psychologist Walter Mischel presented children between age four and six with one marshmallow. He told them that if they waited 15 minutes and didn\u2019t eat it, he would give them a second marshmallow. A long-term follow-up study showed that the children who waited for the second marshmallow had more success later in life.... The cuttlefish version of the experiment looked a lot different. The researchers worked with six cuttlefish under nine months old and presented them with seafood instead of sweets.\n\t(Preliminary experiments showed that cuttlefishes\u2019 favorite food is live grass shrimp, while raw prawns are so-so and Asian shore crab is nearly unacceptable.) Since the researchers couldn\u2019t explain to the cuttlefish that they would need to wait for their shrimp, they trained them to recognize certain shapes that indicated when a food item would become available.\n\tThe symbols were pasted on transparent drawers so that the cuttlefish could see the food that was stored inside. One drawer, labeled with a circle to mean \u201cimmediate,\u201d held raw king prawn. Another drawer, labeled with a triangle to mean \u201cdelayed,\u201d held live grass shrimp. During a control experiment, square labels meant \u201cnever.\u201d \u201cIf their self-control is flexible and I hadn\u2019t just trained them to wait in any context, you would expect the cuttlefish to take the immediate reward [in the control], even if it\u2019s their second preference,\u201d says Schnell... and that\u2019s what they did. That showed the researchers that cuttlefish wouldn\u2019t reject the prawns if it was the only food available. In the experimental trials, the cuttlefish didn\u2019t jump on the prawns if the live grass shrimp were labeled with a triangle\u2014many waited for the shrimp drawer to open up. Each time the cuttlefish showed it could wait, the researchers tacked another ten seconds on to the next round of waiting before releasing the shrimp. The longest that a cuttlefish waited was 130 seconds.\n\tSchnell [says] that the cuttlefish usually sat at the bottom of the tank and looked at the two food items while they waited, but sometimes, they would turn away from the king prawn \u201cas if to distract themselves from the temptation of the immediate reward.\u201d In past studies, humans, chimpanzees, parrots and dogs also tried to distract themselves while waiting for a reward.\n\tNot every species can use self-control, but most of the animals that can share another trait in common: long, social lives. Cuttlefish, on the other hand, are solitary creatures that don\u2019t form relationships even with mates or young.... \u201cWe don\u2019t know if living in a social group is important for complex cognition unless we also show those abilities are lacking in less social species,\u201d says... comparative psychologist Jennifer Vonk.",
