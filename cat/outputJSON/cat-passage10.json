The maximum accuracy of a clock is directly related to how much disorder, or entropy, it creates every time it ticks. Natalia Ares at the University of Oxford and her colleagues made this discovery using a tiny clock with an accuracy that can be controlled. The clock consists of a 50-nanometre-thick membrane of silicon nitride, vibrated by an electric current. Each time the membrane moved up and down once and then returned to its original position, the researchers counted a tick, and the regularity of the spacing between the ticks represented the accuracy of the clock. The researchers found that as they increased the clock\u2019s accuracy, the heat produced in the system grew, increasing the entropy of its surroundings by jostling nearby particles... \u201cIf a clock is more accurate, you are paying for it somehow,\u201d says Ares. In this case, you pay for it by pouring more ordered energy into the clock, which is then converted into entropy. \u201cBy measuring time, we are increasing the entropy of the universe,\u201d says Ares. The more entropy there is in the universe, the closer it may be to its eventual demise. \u201cMaybe we should stop measuring time,\u201d says Ares. The scale of the additional entropy is so small, though, that there is no need to worry about its effects, she says.\n\tThe increase in entropy in timekeeping may be related to the \u201carrow of time\u201d, says Marcus Huber at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna, who was part of the research team. It has been suggested that the reason that time only flows forward, not in reverse, is that the total amount of entropy in the universe is constantly increasing, creating disorder that cannot be put in order again.\n\tThe relationship that the researchers found is a limit on the accuracy of a clock, so it doesn\u2019t mean that a clock that creates the most possible entropy would be maximally accurate \u2013 hence a large, inefficient grandfather clock isn\u2019t more precise than an atomic clock. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like fuel use in a car. Just because I\u2019m using more fuel doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m going faster or further,\u201d says Huber.\n\tWhen the researchers compared their results with theoretical models developed for clocks that rely on quantum effects, they were surprised to find that the relationship between accuracy and entropy seemed to be the same for both.... We can\u2019t be sure yet that these results are actually universal, though, because there are many types of clocks for which the relationship between accuracy and entropy haven\u2019t been tested. \u201cIt\u2019s still unclear how this principle plays out in real devices such as atomic clocks, which push the ultimate quantum limits of accuracy,\u201d says Mark Mitchison at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland. Understanding this relationship could be helpful for designing clocks in the future, particularly those used in quantum computers and other devices where both accuracy and temperature are crucial, says Ares. This finding could also help us understand more generally how the quantum world and the classical world are similar and different in terms of thermodynamics and the passage of time.",
