<h2>Your Body's Backbone: Understanding the Vertebral Column</h2>
<p>Your spine, or vertebral column, is the central support system of your body. It's made up of individual bones called vertebrae, stacked on top of each other and connected by ligaments and muscles. This flexible column protects your spinal cord, allows for movement, and helps you stand tall.</p>
<p>The vertebral column is divided into five distinct regions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cervical Vertebrae (C1-C7):</strong>  These seven vertebrae make up your neck. The first two, atlas (C1) and axis (C2), are specially shaped for head movement.</li>
<li><strong>Thoracic Vertebrae (T1-T12):</strong> These twelve vertebrae are located in your chest, connecting to your ribs and forming the rib cage.</li>
<li><strong>Lumbar Vertebrae (L1-L5):</strong> These five vertebrae make up your lower back. They are the largest and strongest, supporting the weight of your upper body.</li>
<li><strong>Sacral Vertebrae (S1-S5):</strong> These five vertebrae are fused together to form the sacrum, which connects your spine to your pelvis. </li>
<li><strong>Coccygeal Vertebrae (Co1-Co4):</strong> These 3-5 fused vertebrae make up your tailbone (coccyx).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember this order:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cervical – Thoracic – Lumbar – Sacral – Coccygeal</strong> </p>
<p>This order helps you understand how your spine is organized, from your neck down to your tailbone.  </p>
