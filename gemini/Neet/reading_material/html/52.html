<p>The rib cage is like a protective cage for your vital organs, especially your heart and lungs.  It's made of 12 pairs of ribs, each connected to your spine at the back.  The first 7 pairs attach directly to the breastbone (sternum) in the front. The next 3 pairs attach indirectly, sharing cartilage.  But the last 2 pairs, the 11th and 12th, are called <strong>floating ribs</strong> because they don't connect to the breastbone at all! </p>
