<p>The human body is a marvel of movement, powered by different types of muscles, each with unique characteristics and roles.  </p>
<p><strong>Striated Muscles:</strong> These muscles are named for their striped appearance under a microscope, thanks to the organized arrangement of proteins called actin and myosin. This structure allows for powerful and quick contractions.  There are two main types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skeletal Muscles:</strong>  These are the muscles we control consciously, attached to our bones, enabling us to walk, run, lift, and more. </li>
<li><strong>Cardiac Muscles:</strong> These form the heart and are responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. Interestingly, while they are striated, they are not under conscious control.  They beat automatically, ensuring a constant supply of blood.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Involuntary Muscles:</strong> These muscles operate without our conscious control, managed by the autonomic nervous system, which handles internal bodily functions. There are two main types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cardiac Muscles:</strong> As mentioned, these are the muscles of the heart.</li>
<li><strong>Smooth Muscles:</strong> Found in the walls of internal organs like the stomach and bladder, smooth muscles control internal processes like digestion and urination. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So, what muscles are both striated and involuntary?</strong> The answer is <strong>Cardiac Muscles</strong>. They have the striated appearance of skeletal muscles but operate without conscious control, like smooth muscles. This unique combination allows the heart to work tirelessly and rhythmically, ensuring our survival. </p>
