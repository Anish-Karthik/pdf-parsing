<p>Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that weakens muscles. The body's own immune system mistakenly attacks the acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the neuromuscular junction, disrupting communication between nerves and muscles. This disruption leads to muscle weakness, which is the main symptom of MG. </p>
<p><strong>In short, Myasthenia gravis is a muscle disorder caused by defective antibodies.</strong> </p>
