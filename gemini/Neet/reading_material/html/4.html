<p>Our bodies are amazing movement machines, thanks to <strong>skeletal muscle</strong>.  These powerful muscles are responsible for everything from walking to lifting weights. </p>
<p>Here's what makes skeletal muscle special:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Striped:</strong> Under a microscope, skeletal muscle looks like it has stripes.</li>
<li><strong>Voluntary:</strong> You control skeletal muscles -  you decide when to move them! </li>
<li><strong>Locomotion:</strong>  Skeletal muscle is the star of movement, letting you walk, run, and jump.</li>
<li><strong>Posture:</strong> It also helps keep you upright and balanced.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So, the answer to the question is skeletal muscle.</strong> Think of the biceps in your arm -  that's a great example of a skeletal muscle that helps you flex your arm. </p>
