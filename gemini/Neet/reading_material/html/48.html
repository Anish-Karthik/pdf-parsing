<p>The human skeleton is a marvel of engineering, providing structure, support, and movement.  Each arm is a complex system of 30 bones, working together to give us the dexterity and strength we need to interact with the world around us.</p>
<p>Let's break down the arm's bony structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shoulder:</strong> The shoulder joint is where the arm meets the body. It's made up of the scapula (shoulder blade) and clavicle (collarbone).</li>
<li><strong>Upper Arm:</strong> The upper arm contains the humerus, the long bone connecting the shoulder and elbow.</li>
<li><strong>Forearm:</strong> The forearm has two bones, the radius and ulna. They work together to move the hand.</li>
<li><strong>Wrist and Hand:</strong>  The wrist contains 8 tiny bones called carpals. The hand itself has 5 metacarpals (palm bones) and 14 phalanges (finger bones).</li>
</ul>
<p>These bones, along with the muscles and joints, create a powerful system that allows us to reach, grasp, and move with precision.  </p>
<p><strong>So, the answer is: Each arm of a human is made of 30 bones.</strong> </p>
