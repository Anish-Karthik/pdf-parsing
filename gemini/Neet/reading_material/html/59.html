<p>The joint where your thumb connects to your wrist is called the <strong>carpometacarpal joint</strong>. This specific joint, the one between the trapezium bone (in your wrist) and the first metacarpal (your thumb bone), is a special type called a <strong>saddle joint</strong>.  </p>
<p>Think of a rider sitting in a saddle - that's how this joint works! The trapezium bone has a concave (hollowed-out) surface that the thumb bone, with its convex (rounded) surface, fits perfectly into. This unique shape lets your thumb move in many directions: you can touch your fingertips, bend it, move it away from your hand, and more! </p>
<p>This special joint is the reason we have such incredible dexterity and can grasp objects with our hands.  </p>
