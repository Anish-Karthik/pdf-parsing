<p>Imagine a muscle fiber as a tiny string of beads, with each bead representing a functional unit called a sarcomere. Inside each sarcomere, you'll find thicker and thinner strands of proteins, called thick and thin filaments. These filaments are responsible for muscle contraction.</p>
<p>The thick filaments, made primarily of the protein myosin, are like bundles of tiny clubs with heads that can bind to the thinner filaments. The thin filaments, made of the protein actin, are like strings that wrap around the thick filaments.</p>
<p>When a muscle is relaxed, the thin filaments only partially overlap the thick filaments. This creates a central region within the thick filament that's not covered by the thin filaments.  This region is known as the <strong>H-zone</strong>.</p>
<p>So, the answer is:  <strong>The central part of the thick filament, not overlapped by thin filaments when a muscle is in a relaxed state is called the H-zone.</strong> </p>
