<p>The human skeleton is a marvel of engineering, providing support, protection, and allowing for movement.  One interesting aspect is the structure of the hands and feet.  </p>
<p>Our wrists are made up of eight small bones called carpals.  The ankles, on the other hand, consist of seven small bones called tarsals.  So, the analogy is: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carpals: 8 :: Tarsals: 7</strong> </li>
</ul>
