<p>Our bodies are incredible machines, powered by different types of muscles.  Let's explore them:</p>
<p><strong>Visceral Muscles: The Unsung Heroes</strong></p>
<p>These muscles are found in the walls of our internal organs, like the stomach, intestines, and bladder. They work tirelessly, moving these organs to help us digest food, urinate, and even circulate blood.  Think of them as the hardworking crew behind the scenes, keeping our bodies functioning smoothly. </p>
<p>You might know them by other names too: <strong>involuntary non-striated muscles</strong> or <strong>smooth muscles</strong>. The "non-striated" part means they lack the striped appearance you see under a microscope, unlike skeletal muscles. </p>
<p><strong>Involuntary Muscles: Working Without Our Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>Involuntary muscles are controlled by our autonomic nervous system. This means we don't have to think about making them move â€“ they just do their thing automatically!  Examples include the visceral muscles we just talked about, and even our heart muscle (cardiac muscle). </p>
<p><strong>Smooth Muscles: The Gentle Giants</strong></p>
<p>Smooth muscles are responsible for slow, sustained movements inside our bodies. They're found in the walls of our digestive tract, urinary bladder, and even our blood vessels. Imagine them as the calm, steady hands guiding our internal processes.</p>
<p><strong>Locomotion and Movement: Working Together</strong></p>
<p>While skeletal muscles help us move around, smooth muscles are crucial for internal movements. They assist in digestion, blood circulation, and other essential functions. Together, they create a symphony of movement within our bodies.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway: Visceral muscles are also known as involuntary non-striated muscles, or smooth muscles.</strong> They play a vital role in keeping our internal organs functioning smoothly and efficiently. </p>
