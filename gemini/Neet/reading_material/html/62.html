<p>Our bodies are amazing machines!  One of the most important parts is our skeleton, which acts like a framework, holding us up and giving us shape.  But how do we move?  That's where <strong>joints</strong> come in. </p>
<p>Joints are where bones meet, and they allow us to bend, twist, and move in different ways.  One special kind of joint is called a <strong>pivot joint</strong>, which lets us rotate parts of our body.</p>
<p>A great example of a pivot joint is the one in our neck, between the <strong>atlas</strong> and <strong>axis</strong>, two special bones that let us turn our heads from side to side.</p>
<p>The <strong>atlas</strong>, the first bone in our neck, is shaped like a ring and sits right below our skull.  The <strong>axis</strong>, the second bone, has a bony projection called the <strong>odontoid process</strong>, which sticks up through the atlas. This acts like a pivot point, allowing the atlas to spin around it.</p>
<p>So, when you shake your head "no," the atlas is rotating around the odontoid process of the axis, thanks to that amazing pivot joint!  </p>
