It's essentially a specialized type of **tissue fluid** that originates from blood plasma.</p><hr><h3>Key Components of Lymph</h3><p>Lymph is composed of:</p><ul>    <li><strong>Water:</strong> The main constituent, acting as a solvent for other components.</li>    <li><strong>Dissolved substances:</strong> This includes nutrients, electrolytes, and waste products.</li>    <li><strong>White blood cells (lymphocytes):</strong> These are crucial for immune defense, fighting infections and foreign invaders.</li>    <li><strong>Small proteins:</strong> Lymph contains smaller proteins that have leaked out from the blood, aiding in the transport of nutrients and waste.</li></ul><hr><h3>What Lymph Doesn't Contain</h3><p>While lymph is derived from blood plasma, it lacks some of the larger components found in blood. These include:</p><ul>    <li><strong>Large proteins:</strong>  Large proteins, like albumin, are too big to pass through the capillary walls that filter blood plasma into tissue fluid and eventually lymph.</li>    <li><strong>Most of the formed elements:</strong> This refers to the blood cells â€“ red blood cells, white blood cells (except lymphocytes), and platelets. These cells are larger and remain within the blood vessels.</li></ul><hr><h3>Comparison with Blood</h3><p>Here's a simple comparison to illustrate the differences:</p><table>    <tr>        <th>Feature</th>        <th>Blood</th>        <th>Lymph</th>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>Color</td>        <td>Red</td>        <td>Clear</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>Protein content</td>        <td>High (including large proteins)</td>        <td>Low (mainly smaller proteins)</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>Formed elements</td>        <td>All blood cells</td>        <td>Primarily lymphocytes</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>Oxygen content</td>        <td>High</td>        <td>Lower</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>Flow</td>        <td>Circulates through blood vessels</td>        <td>Flows through lymphatic vessels</td>    </tr></table><hr><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Lymph is a vital fluid essential for maintaining the body's fluid balance and immune system function. While it's closely related to blood, it differs in its composition, primarily lacking large proteins and most formed elements. This difference highlights the specialized function of lymph in the body's complex network of fluids.</p></body></html>
