<p>Our bodies are amazing machines, and the secret to their movement lies in <strong>joints</strong>, the places where bones meet. These connections allow us to do everything from walking to dancing!</p>
<p>Imagine our spines, made up of individual bones called <strong>vertebrae</strong>. These vertebrae are stacked like building blocks, creating a strong and flexible column. The joints between these vertebrae are special - they allow for <strong>limited movement</strong>, which is super important for the spine's flexibility and stability. This means you can bend, twist, and move your spine while still keeping it strong!</p>
<p>These types of joints are called <strong>cartilaginous joints</strong>, and they're designed for controlled movement. They're different from joints like your shoulder, which lets your arm move freely in many directions.</p>
<p>So, the joints between adjacent vertebrae are key for giving your spine its amazing ability to move while still being super strong and supportive! </p>
