<p>Our bones are a vital part of our body, providing structure, protection, and allowing us to move.  However, sometimes our bones can become weak, leading to a condition called <strong>osteoporosis</strong>. </p>
<p>Osteoporosis means our bones lose density, becoming brittle and fragile. This makes them more likely to break, even from minor falls or everyday activities.  While it can happen at any age, osteoporosis is more common as we get older. </p>
<p>So, the answer is: <strong>Osteoporosis - Decrease in bone mass and higher chances of fractures with advancing age.</strong> </p>
