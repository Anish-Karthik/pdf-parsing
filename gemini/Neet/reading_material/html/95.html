<h2>Your Rib Cage: A Protective Shield</h2>
<p>Your rib cage is a strong, bony framework that protects your vital organs, like your heart and lungs. It's made up of 12 pairs of ribs, each one a curved, flat bone.  </p>
<p>Here's the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>True Ribs:</strong> The top 7 pairs connect directly to your sternum (breastbone) using their own cartilage. </li>
<li><strong>False Ribs:</strong> Ribs 8, 9, and 10 are a bit trickier. They don't connect directly to the sternum but instead share a cartilage connection with the 7th rib.  </li>
<li><strong>Floating Ribs:</strong> The last two pairs (11th and 12th) are called "floating" because they don't attach to the sternum at all.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hyaline Cartilage:</strong> This flexible connective tissue acts like a smooth, slippery surface between bones, allowing them to move easily. It plays a vital role in connecting the ribs to the sternum.</p>
<p><strong>So, the ribs that don't directly connect to the sternum, but attach to the cartilage of another rib, are the 8th, 9th, and 10th ribs.</strong>  They're a team! </p>
