<p>The neck is a complex structure made up of several bones that work together to allow for movement and support the head.  The first bone in the neck, known as the atlas (C1), is a unique vertebra that lacks a body and instead has two lateral masses connected by arches. It articulates with the occipital condyles, which are two bony projections on the underside of the skull. This articulation allows the head to nod and tilt. </p>
<p>The second vertebra, called the axis (C2), has a special projection called the odontoid process that extends upwards, acting as a pivot point for the atlas. This allows the head to rotate from side to side.</p>
<p>The statement <strong>"The first vertebra is axis and it articulates with occipital condyles"</strong> is incorrect. The first vertebra is the atlas (C1), not the axis (C2). And the atlas articulates with the occipital condyles, not the axis. </p>
