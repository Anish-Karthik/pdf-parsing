<p>Muscle contraction is a fascinating process that allows us to move.  At the heart of this process is the sliding filament model, which explains how muscles shorten. </p>
<p>The sliding filament model focuses on two key protein players: actin and myosin.  Actin, a thin filament, forms long chains that look like ropes. Myosin, a thicker filament with "heads", acts like a motor protein that can grab onto the actin rope. </p>
<p>During contraction, the myosin heads bind to actin and use energy to "walk" along the actin filament. This "walking" action pulls the actin filaments closer together, causing the muscle to shorten. </p>
<p>So, the polymerized molecule that moves to shorten a muscle is <strong>actin</strong>. </p>
