<p>Imagine the sarcomere, the muscle's tiny engine, with actin and myosin filaments as its key components. During contraction, the myosin heads pull on the actin filaments, causing them to slide closer to the M line, the sarcomere's center point. </p>
<p>This shortening makes the entire sarcomere denser, blurring the distinct appearance of the M line.  It doesn't actually disappear, but its visibility is masked by the dense overlap of actin and myosin filaments. </p>
