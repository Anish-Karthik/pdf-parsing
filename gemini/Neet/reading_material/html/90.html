<p>Bones are the building blocks of our skeletal system, providing support, protection, and enabling movement. When something goes wrong with our bones, it's called a bone disorder.  Examples include osteoporosis, where bones become weak and brittle, or rickets, a condition that affects bone growth in children.</p>
<p>Now, think about blood vessels.  These are the tubes that carry blood throughout our body, delivering oxygen and nutrients. Sometimes, these blood vessels can become clogged with fatty deposits, a condition known as atherosclerosis. While this affects our blood flow, it doesn't directly impact our bones.</p>
<p>So, while a healthy cardiovascular system is important for overall health, including bone health, atherosclerosis is not considered a disorder of the bones. </p>
