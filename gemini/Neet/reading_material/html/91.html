<h2>Macrophages and Leucocytes: On the Move!</h2>
<p>Imagine your body as a bustling city, with different types of cells working together to keep everything running smoothly. Among these cells are the <strong>macrophages</strong> and <strong>leucocytes</strong>. They're like the first responders, patrolling the city and fighting off invaders like bacteria and viruses. </p>
<p>To get around, macrophages and leucocytes use a unique form of movement called <strong>amoeboid movement</strong>. Imagine a blob of goo extending itself forward, forming temporary "arms" called <strong>pseudopodia</strong>. These cells literally crawl through tissues using these pseudopodia, allowing them to reach infection sites and engulf pathogens.</p>
<p>This movement is crucial for their job: <strong>phagocytosis</strong>.  They use their "arms" to surround and engulf foreign invaders like bacteria and cellular debris, effectively cleaning up the city and keeping you healthy. </p>
<p>So, the next time you think about your immune system, remember these amazing cells that constantly move and fight to keep you safe! </p>
