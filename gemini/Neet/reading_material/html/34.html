<p>Our skulls are incredibly strong and protective thanks to the way their bones are joined together.  These connections are called <strong>fibrous joints</strong>, and they're specifically designed for strength and stability.</p>
<p>Think of the skull bones like puzzle pieces, interlocking with each other.  They're held tightly in place by <strong>dense fibrous connective tissue</strong>, which is a tough, flexible material that acts like glue. These joints, called <strong>sutures</strong>, are only found in the skull and give it the rigidity needed to protect our brains. </p>
<p>So, the answer is <strong>fibrous joint</strong>. </p>
