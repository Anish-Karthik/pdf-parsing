<p>Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder that weakens skeletal muscles. This happens because the body mistakenly attacks the acetylcholine receptors on muscle fibers, making it hard for nerves to signal muscles to contract.</p>
<p>To combat this, a primary treatment is <strong>injection of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors</strong>. These drugs work by preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine, the chemical messenger that helps muscles contract. This means more acetylcholine is available to bind to the remaining receptors, leading to improved muscle function. </p>
