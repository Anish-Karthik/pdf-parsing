<p>Our skeletal system is a complex and amazing framework that supports and protects our bodies. Let's explore some key parts and how they work together.</p>
<p>The <strong>sternum</strong>, or "breastbone," is a flat bone in the center of your chest. It acts as a central anchor point for the <strong>ribs</strong>, which form the protective cage around your heart and lungs. </p>
<p>These ribs are connected to the sternum by <strong>hyaline cartilage</strong>, a type of flexible connective tissue. This type of cartilage is called <strong>costal cartilage</strong> when it connects ribs to the sternum. It allows for a bit of flexibility in the rib cage, which is important for breathing.  It also helps prevent the ribs from rubbing directly on the sternum, protecting the delicate tissues inside. </p>
<p>So, the answer is <strong>hyaline cartilage</strong>!  </p>
