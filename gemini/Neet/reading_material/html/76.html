<p>Moving around is a complex feat!  Think of it like a well-oiled machine:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locomotion:</strong> The big picture - the act of getting from point A to point B.</li>
<li><strong>Movement:</strong>  The smaller parts - any change in position, even just wiggling your toes.</li>
<li><strong>Biological:</strong>  The life force behind it all - the processes that make our bodies work.</li>
<li><strong>Muscles:</strong>  The engines! They contract and pull, making things move.</li>
<li><strong>Skeletal System:</strong>  The frame! Bones provide structure and attachment points for the muscles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>They all work together perfectly.</strong>  Muscles pull on bones, and the bones move.  These are the biological processes that make locomotion possible.  It's a beautiful symphony of moving parts! </p>
