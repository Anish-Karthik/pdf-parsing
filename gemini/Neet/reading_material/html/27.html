<p>Imagine a muscle fiber as a tiny factory filled with microscopic machines called sarcomeres. These sarcomeres are the workhorses of muscle contraction, each containing two types of protein filaments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thin filaments (Actin):</strong> These are like long chains anchored at the edges of the sarcomere.</li>
<li><strong>Thick filaments (Myosin):</strong> These are thicker filaments with "heads" that reach out towards the actin chains.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a muscle receives a signal to contract, the myosin heads grab onto the actin chains and pull them inwards, like tiny tugboats. This movement is called the <strong>sliding filament theory</strong>. The key thing to remember is that <strong>the thick filaments (myosin) don't move inwards</strong>; they stay anchored in place while the thin filaments (actin) slide past them.</p>
<p>Think of it like a rope ladder. During contraction, the rungs (actin) slide down the rope (myosin), but the rope itself stays fixed. This pulling action shortens the sarcomere, which in turn shortens the entire muscle fiber, leading to contraction.</p>
<p><strong>So, the answer to the question is: Thick filaments slide inward towards the M-line.</strong> This doesn't happen! The thick filaments stay put while the thin filaments slide towards them. </p>
