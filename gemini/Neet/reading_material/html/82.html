<p>The vertebral column, or backbone, is a crucial part of the skeletal system in many animals, including mammals. It's made up of individual bones called vertebrae, stacked on top of each other and separated by intervertebral discs.</p>
<p>Think of these discs as nature's shock absorbers! They're tough, fibrous pads that cushion the vertebrae, allowing for flexibility and movement. These discs are especially important for mammals, as they allow for a wide range of locomotion, from crawling to running, swimming, and flying. </p>
<p><strong>Intervertebral discs are found in the vertebral column of mammals.</strong> They are essential for the flexibility and movement of the spine, providing structural support for the entire body. </p>
