To find what you're looking for easily, you might organize them into groups: cars, dolls, blocks, etc. That's what scientists do with living organisms: they use a system called **taxonomy** to classify and name them.</p><p>This system helps us understand the relationships between different species and study their characteristics.</p><h3>Key Terms:</h3><ul>  <li>**Classification:** The process of grouping organisms based on shared features.</li>  <li>**Taxonomic Categories:** These are levels within the classification system, like kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.  Think of them as nested boxes, with each level containing a smaller group.</li>  <li>**Hierarchy:** The arrangement of these categories from broadest to most specific.  </li>  <li>**Nomenclature:** The system of naming organisms using a standardized set of rules.</li></ul><p>So, how does the suffix "-oideae" fit into all of this?</p><div class="explanation">  <h3>The Suffix "-oideae"</h3>  <p>The suffix "-oideae" is specifically used in the **botanical** classification system.  It designates a **subfamily**, a taxonomic category that ranks below the family but above the tribe. </p>  <p>Here's a simple example:</p>  <ul>    <li>**Family:**  Rosaceae (Rose family)</li>    <li>**Subfamily:** Rosoideae (Rose subfamily)</li>  </ul>  <p>Remember: "-oideae" specifically signifies a subfamily in botany, not in other fields of biology.</p></div></body></html>
