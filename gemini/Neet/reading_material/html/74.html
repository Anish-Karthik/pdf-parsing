<p>Our bodies are incredible machines, with different types of muscle tissue working tirelessly to keep us going. One of these, smooth muscle, is found in our internal organs, responsible for tasks like moving food through our digestive system. </p>
<p>While other muscles, like the ones we use to walk and lift, need lots of blood to fuel their activity, smooth muscle doesn't require as much. This is because it works slowly and doesn't need as much energy. Think of it like a marathon runner compared to a sprinter â€“ the runner needs fuel for a long, steady pace, while the sprinter needs a quick burst of energy.</p>
<p>So, when it comes to the least blood supply, it's the smooth muscle that takes the lead. </p>
