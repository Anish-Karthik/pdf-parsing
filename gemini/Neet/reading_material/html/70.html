<p>Myasthenia gravis is a tricky autoimmune disease. Imagine your body's immune system, meant to protect you, attacking your own muscles!  It does this by targeting <strong>acetylcholine receptors</strong> (those little gateways that help your muscles receive signals to move).  When antibodies bind to these receptors, they block the signal, leading to <strong>muscle weakness</strong> that worsens with activity. So, even simple tasks can become tiring. </p>
