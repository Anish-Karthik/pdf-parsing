<p>Macrophages are like the body's clean-up crew, patrolling tissues to gobble up invaders and debris. To do this, they need to move around. They achieve this with special structures called <strong>pseudopodia</strong>. Imagine a blob of jelly pushing out little arms to move forward â€“ that's exactly what pseudopodia do!
