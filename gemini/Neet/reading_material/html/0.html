<h2>Rh Incompatibility: A Quick Guide</h2><p>Imagine a mother who doesn't have a certain protein on her red blood cells (<span class=\"important\">Rh-negative</span>).  She gives birth to a baby who <em>does</em> have this protein (<span class=\"important\">Rh-positive</span>). This creates a potential problem: </p><p><strong>The Danger:</strong>  During birth, a small amount of the baby's blood can enter the mother's bloodstream. Her immune system sees this \"foreign\" protein and starts making antibodies to fight it. If she gets pregnant again with another <span class=\"important\">Rh-positive</span> baby, these antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's blood, causing anemia and even death. This is called <strong>Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN).</strong></p><p><strong>The Solution:</strong>  Fortunately, there's a simple solution!  Doctors give the mother a special injection called <span class=\"important\">RhoGAM</span> right after delivery. This injection contains antibodies that bind to any <span class=\"important\">Rh-positive</span> blood cells in the mother's system, preventing her from developing her own harmful antibodies.</p><p><strong>In short, <span class=\"important\">RhoGAM</span> protects future pregnancies for <span class=\"important\">Rh-negative</span> mothers by preventing their immune systems from attacking <span class=\"important\">Rh-positive</span> babies.</strong> </p>
