<p>The human hand is a marvel of engineering, with a complex arrangement of bones that allows for incredible dexterity. One way to understand this structure is through the <strong>phalangeal formula</strong>. This formula describes the number of bones (phalanges) in each finger, starting with the thumb and moving towards the pinky. </p>
<p>The thumb, being different from the other fingers, has only two phalanges: a proximal and a distal.  Each of the remaining fingers – index, middle, ring, and little –  has three phalanges: proximal, middle, and distal. </p>
<p>This leads to the phalangeal formula for the human hand: <strong>2-3-3-3-3</strong>.  So, in essence, the human hand has <strong>2</strong> phalanges in the thumb, <strong>3</strong> in the index finger, <strong>3</strong> in the middle finger, <strong>3</strong> in the ring finger, and <strong>3</strong> in the little finger. </p>
