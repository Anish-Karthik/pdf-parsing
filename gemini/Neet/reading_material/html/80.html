<p>Your body's framework, the skeleton, is made up of strong bones connected by ligaments and tendons.  This amazing structure provides support, protects vital organs, and allows for movement. </p>
<p>One important part of your skeleton is the <strong>thoracic cage</strong>. This bony cage protects your heart and lungs. It's made up of the <strong>sternum</strong> (your breastbone), the <strong>ribs</strong>, and the <strong>vertebral column</strong> (your spine). </p>
<p><strong>Ribs are attached to the sternum</strong> at the front of your body. They also connect to the vertebral column at the back, forming a strong, protective structure. </p>
