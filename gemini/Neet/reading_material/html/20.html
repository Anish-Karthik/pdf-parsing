<p>The <strong>axial skeleton</strong> forms the central axis of your body, providing support and protection for vital organs. It's made up of the skull, spine, and rib cage.  </p>
<p>Within the <strong>thorax</strong>, the chest region, lies the <strong>sternum</strong>, also known as the breastbone. This <strong>flat bone</strong> is located on the <strong>ventral midline</strong>, which is the front center line of your body. The sternum connects to the ribs through costal cartilages, creating the front part of your rib cage.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, the flat bone of the axial skeleton that sits on the ventral midline of the thorax is the sternum.</strong> </p>
