<p>Our bodies are amazing machines!  They're built with bones that connect to each other through <strong>joints</strong>. Joints are like hinges, allowing us to move and bend in all sorts of ways.  But not all joints are the same! </p>
<p>There are three main types of joints:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fibrous Joints:</strong> These joints are super strong and <strong>don't allow any movement</strong>. They're like glue holding bones together. Think of the sutures in your skull, keeping your head safe and strong.</li>
<li><strong>Cartilaginous Joints:</strong> These joints allow a little bit of movement, but not much. They're like flexible cushions, giving us a bit of bend. The intervertebral discs in your spine are a great example.</li>
<li><strong>Synovial Joints:</strong> These joints are the superstars of movement. They're <strong>freely movable</strong>, letting us bend, twist, and rotate.  Our knees, shoulders, and hips are all synovial joints.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the answer to your question is <strong>Fibrous Joints</strong>. They are the rock stars of stability and strength, keeping our bones locked in place. </p>
