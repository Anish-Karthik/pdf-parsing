<p>Muscular dystrophy is a group of genetic disorders that cause progressive weakness and degeneration of skeletal muscles. This means the muscles that control movement, like those in your arms and legs, gradually weaken and break down over time.  This makes it harder and harder to walk, run, climb stairs, and do everyday activities. </p>
