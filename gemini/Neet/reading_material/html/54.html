<h2>The Pectoral Girdle: Your Upper Limb's Foundation</h2>
<p>The pectoral girdle acts like a bridge, connecting your upper limbs to your torso.  It's made up of two strong bones on each side: the clavicle (collarbone) and the scapula (shoulder blade).</p>
<p><strong>Clavicle:</strong> This S-shaped bone runs horizontally across your chest, linking the scapula to your breastbone (sternum).</p>
<p><strong>Scapula:</strong> This triangular bone sits on your back, nestled against your ribcage. It has a prominent bump called the <strong>acromion</strong>, which forms a joint with the clavicle.</p>
<p><strong>The Glenoid Cavity: Where the Magic Happens</strong></p>
<p>The scapula also has a special feature: the <strong>glenoid cavity</strong>. This shallow, cup-shaped socket on the scapula's outer side is where the head of your humerus (upper arm bone) fits snugly. This connection forms the <strong>shoulder joint</strong>, which allows for incredible flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> While the glenoid cavity is essential for the shoulder joint, it's not a separate component of the pectoral girdle. It's a part of the <strong>scapula</strong>, one of the two bones that make up the pectoral girdle. </p>
