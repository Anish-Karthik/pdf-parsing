<p>Let's talk about bones! The human skeleton is a complex system of over 200 bones that provide structure and support.  </p>
<p>When we talk about <strong>girdle bones</strong>, we're referring to special bones that act like bridges, connecting our limbs to the main body. Think of the <strong>pectoral girdle</strong>, which holds our arms in place with the help of the shoulder blade and collarbone.  Or the <strong>pelvic girdle</strong> that connects our legs with the hips, made up of the ilium, ischium, and pubis.</p>
<p>Now, let's consider the <strong>ileum</strong>.  The ileum isn't a bone at all! It's part of our digestive system, specifically the small intestine, which is responsible for absorbing nutrients from the food we eat. </p>
<p>So, the odd one out is the <strong>ileum</strong>, as it's not a bone and isn't part of the skeletal system like the other terms. </p>
