<p>Imagine a muscle like a tiny machine, made of tiny units called sarcomeres. Inside each sarcomere, there are two types of protein threads: thin actin filaments and thick myosin filaments.  </p>
<p>These filaments work together to make the muscle contract. Think of them like tiny hands grabbing onto each other and pulling.  The "grabbing" action is powered by ATP, a molecule that acts like fuel for the muscle.</p>
<p>Now, let's say the ATP supply suddenly stops. The myosin filaments, still holding onto the actin filaments, can't let go.  They're stuck in a "grabbing" position, and the muscle remains contracted.  </p>
<p>What's more, without ATP, the calcium that helps the muscle relax can't be pumped back into its storage area.  This means the muscle can't relax, even if it wants to. </p>
<p>So, in short: If ATP suddenly disappears, the muscle stays contracted and unable to relax. It's like the machine suddenly loses its power source, locking up in whatever position it was in.  </p>
