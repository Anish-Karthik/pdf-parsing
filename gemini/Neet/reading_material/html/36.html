<p>The human rib cage is a vital protective structure, made up of 12 pairs of ribs, the sternum, and vertebrae.  While most ribs connect directly to the sternum, some are attached indirectly or not at all.</p>
<p><strong>Here's the breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>True Ribs (1-7):</strong>  Attached directly to the sternum via cartilage.</li>
<li><strong>False Ribs (8-10):</strong>  Connected to the 7th rib through cartilage, not directly to the sternum.</li>
<li><strong>Floating Ribs (11-12):</strong>  Only attached to the vertebrae, not the sternum.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term <strong>"vertebrochondral ribs"</strong> specifically refers to the <strong>false ribs (8-10)</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>The Incorrect Match:</strong></p>
<p>The statement <strong>"Vertebrochondral ribs - 11th and 12th pair of ribs"</strong> is <strong>incorrect</strong>.  The 11th and 12th ribs are <strong>floating ribs</strong>, not vertebrochondral. </p>
