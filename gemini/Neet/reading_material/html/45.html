<p>Our bodies have an incredible defense system called the immune system. It protects us from invaders like bacteria and viruses using a process called inflammation. However, sometimes the immune system mistakenly attacks its own healthy cells, leading to autoimmune disorders. </p>
<p>These disorders, like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis, cause chronic inflammation and damage to various parts of the body. Gout, on the other hand, isn't an autoimmune disorder. It's caused by a buildup of uric acid in the blood, which forms crystals that deposit in joints, causing pain and inflammation.  </p>
<p>Autoimmune disorders can significantly affect movement and mobility due to inflammation in joints, muscles, and nerves. This can result in pain, stiffness, limited range of motion, muscle weakness, and impaired mobility.  </p>
<p>Remember, understanding the difference between autoimmune disorders and other conditions like gout is essential for proper diagnosis and treatment. </p>
