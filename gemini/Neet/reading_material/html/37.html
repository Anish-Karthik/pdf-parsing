<p>The statement "A single U-shaped bone called hyoid is present at the base of the buccal cavity: Appendicular skeleton" is <strong>mismatched</strong>. </p>
<p>Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hyoid Bone:</strong> This unique bone sits in your neck, above your voice box. It's the only bone in your body that doesn't connect directly to another bone. It helps with swallowing and talking. </li>
<li><strong>Appendicular Skeleton:</strong> This is your body's framework for movement. It includes your arms, legs, shoulders, and hips.  </li>
<li><strong>The Mismatch:</strong> The hyoid bone belongs to your <strong>axial skeleton</strong>, which is your body's central axis. It includes your skull, spine, ribs, and breastbone. It's not part of your appendicular skeleton. </li>
</ul>
<p>So, while the hyoid bone is indeed a single U-shaped bone near the mouth (buccal cavity), it's not part of your appendicular skeleton! </p>
