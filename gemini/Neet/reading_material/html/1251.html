This process involves grouping organisms based on shared characteristics, and the resulting groups are known as <strong>taxa</strong> (singular: <strong>taxon</strong>).</p><hr><h2>Defining Taxon</h2><p>A **taxon** represents a single unit within the classification system. For instance, a specific species like <em>Homo sapiens</em> would be considered a taxon.  Think of it as a specific category or label within a hierarchy.</p><hr><h2>Defining Taxa</h2><p>The term **taxa** simply represents the plural form of **taxon**. So, if we are talking about multiple groups within a classification system, we would refer to them as **taxa**. For example, "Different taxa of animals exist within the kingdom Animalia." </p><hr><h2>Key Points to Remember:</h2><ul>  <li>**Taxon:** Singular form, representing a single unit within the classification system.</li>  <li>**Taxa:** Plural form, representing multiple units within the classification system.</li></ul><p>In essence, "taxa" are simply multiple instances of "taxon".</p></body></html>
