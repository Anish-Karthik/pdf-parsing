<p>Imagine a muscle fiber as a chain of tiny units called sarcomeres. These are like mini-engines responsible for muscle movement. They are made up of two main types of protein filaments: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thin Filaments (Actin):</strong> Anchored at the edges of the sarcomere, these filaments slide during contraction.</li>
<li><strong>Thick Filaments (Myosin):</strong> Located in the center, these filaments have "heads" that bind to actin, pulling them together.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a relaxed state, the <strong>H-zone</strong> is the central, lighter region within the sarcomere where only <strong>myosin filaments</strong> are present. This means there's no overlap with the actin filaments. </p>
<p>When a muscle contracts, the myosin heads pull on the actin filaments, shortening the sarcomere and reducing the H-zone. </p>
<p><strong>Therefore, in a relaxed sarcomere, the H-zone will only contain myosin proteins.</strong> </p>
