<p>Our bodies are incredible machines, powered by a symphony of different tissues working together.  Two of the most fascinating players in this orchestra are <strong>muscular tissue</strong> and <strong>neural tissue</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Muscular tissue</strong> is the engine of motion, allowing us to move, walk, run, and even breathe. It comes in three forms: skeletal muscle (attached to bones for voluntary movement), smooth muscle (lining internal organs for involuntary actions), and cardiac muscle (powering our heart's rhythmic beat).</p>
<p><strong>Neural tissue</strong> acts as the body's communication network. It's made up of neurons, specialized cells that transmit information using electrical and chemical signals.  Think of neurons as the body's messengers, relaying instructions from the brain to the muscles.</p>
<p><strong>What connects these two tissues?  Excitability.</strong> This means both can respond to stimuli.  Neurons respond to stimuli by firing signals, while muscles respond by contracting.  This intricate interplay between neural signals and muscular contractions is what allows us to move. </p>
<p>So, next time you take a step, remember the incredible teamwork of these two tissues, all thanks to their shared property of <strong>excitability</strong>. </p>
