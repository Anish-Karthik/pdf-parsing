<p>The spine is a marvel of engineering! It's made up of individual bones called vertebrae, stacked on top of each other like building blocks.  But how does this rigid structure allow for such amazing flexibility and movement? The secret lies in the <strong>joints</strong> between the vertebrae. </p>
<p>One type of joint found in the spine is called a <strong>gliding joint</strong>. These are like tiny sliding doors, allowing bones to move smoothly past each other. In the spine, these gliding joints are located between the <strong>zygapophyses</strong>, also known as facet joints. </p>
<p>These facet joints, located on the back of each vertebra, allow for a limited but essential range of movement. Imagine the spine as a chain of tiny hinges â€“  each facet joint acts as a hinge, enabling the spine to bend, twist, and rotate, allowing us to walk, run, and perform all sorts of movements.</p>
<p><strong>So, the correct pair is: Gliding joint - Between zygapophyses of the successive vertebrae.</strong> </p>
