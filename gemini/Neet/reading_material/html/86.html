<h2>How Bones Connect: Understanding Joints</h2>
<p>Bones don't just sit next to each other, they're connected by special structures called <strong>joints</strong>.  These joints allow our bodies to move in incredible ways! Think of them like the hinges on a door, but for your bones! </p>
<p>There are different types of joints, each with its own special movement capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hinge Joint:</strong>  Imagine a door hinge – it only allows movement in one direction, like opening and closing.  That's exactly what hinge joints do in your body, like in your elbow and knees.</li>
<li><strong>Ball and Socket Joint:</strong> This one allows for the most movement! Picture a ball sitting in a socket. This is how your shoulder and hip joints work, letting you move your arms and legs in many directions.</li>
<li><strong>Pivot Joint:</strong>  This one lets you rotate around a central point, like turning your forearm. </li>
<li><strong>Gliding Joint:</strong>  Think of sliding two pieces of paper on top of each other – that's what gliding joints do, allowing for small movements like in your wrists and ankles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's talk about the <strong>shoulder joint</strong>.  It's not a hinge joint, but a <strong>ball and socket joint</strong>, allowing for all that awesome arm movement. </p>
<p><strong>So, which one is incorrect?</strong> </p>
<p>It's the idea that the humerus (your upper arm bone) connects to the pectoral girdle (your shoulder bones) with a hinge joint. That's not right – it's a <strong>ball and socket joint</strong>! </p>
