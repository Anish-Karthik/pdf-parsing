<p>Our bodies are amazing machines! One of the key ways they work is through the intricate connection between our muscles and our nervous system.</p>
<p>The nervous system acts like the body's control center, receiving and sending signals. It's divided into two main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Central Nervous System (CNS):</strong> This includes the brain and spinal cord. It's like the body's headquarters, processing information and sending out instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):</strong> This is a network of nerves that connects the CNS to the rest of the body. It acts like the communication system, carrying signals back and forth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's talk about muscles. There are two main types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voluntary Muscles (Skeletal Muscles):</strong> These are the muscles we can control consciously, like lifting a weight or walking. They're attached to our bones and are also called striated muscles because of their striped appearance under a microscope. </li>
<li><strong>Involuntary Muscles (Smooth Muscles):</strong>  These muscles work automatically without us thinking about them.  They are found in the walls of organs like the stomach, intestines, bladder, and blood vessels. They are responsible for essential body functions like digestion and blood flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>The urinary bladder is a hollow organ that stores urine. Its walls are made of smooth muscle, which is controlled by the autonomic nervous system, a part of the PNS that regulates involuntary functions like breathing, heart rate, and digestion.  </p>
<p>So, the walls of the urinary bladder are <strong>not</strong> under our conscious control. We can't choose to make them contract or relax â€“ they work automatically to help us urinate.  </p>
