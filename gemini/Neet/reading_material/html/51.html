<p>Your face is a marvel of engineering, and the <strong>mandible</strong>, or <strong>lower jaw</strong>, is one of its most important parts.  It's the only bone in your skull that can move, allowing you to chew, talk, and even smile!  </p>
<p>The mandible is strong and sturdy, holding your lower teeth and connecting to your skull at the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).  This allows for a wide range of movement, making it essential for eating, speaking, and expressing yourself.  </p>
<p>So, next time you chew on a juicy burger or share a laugh with a friend, remember the mighty mandible â€“ it's the powerhouse behind those actions! </p>
