<p>Your spine, also known as the vertebral column, is a marvel of engineering! It's not just a straight rod, but a series of graceful curves that make you flexible and strong. </p>
<p>Imagine your spine as an "S" shape. The curves facing forward, like the top of the "S", are called <strong>anterior curves</strong>.  These are the ones that allow you to move freely and absorb shock when you walk or run. You have <strong>two</strong> of these anterior curves: one in your neck (the <strong>cervical curve</strong>) and one in your lower back (the <strong>lumbar curve</strong>). </p>
<p>The other curves, facing backward, are called <strong>posterior curves</strong>.  These help to keep you balanced and upright. </p>
<p>So, there you have it: <strong>Two</strong> anterior curves are essential for a healthy and mobile spine! </p>
