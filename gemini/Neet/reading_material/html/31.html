<p>Our bodies are supported by a strong, bony framework called the skeleton. It's divided into two main parts: the <strong>axial skeleton</strong>, which forms the central axis of the body, and the <strong>appendicular skeleton</strong>, which includes the bones of our limbs.</p>
<p>The <strong>axial skeleton</strong> includes the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage.  The <strong>skull</strong>, which protects our brain, is made up of several bones, including the <strong>sphenoid bone</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>appendicular skeleton</strong> is responsible for movement and mobility. It includes the bones of our arms, hands, shoulders, legs, feet, and hips.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> The <strong>sphenoid bone</strong> is a key part of the skull, which is part of the <strong>axial skeleton</strong>. Therefore, it is <strong>not</strong> part of the appendicular skeleton. </p>
