<p>Our muscles are amazing machines, powered by a tiny but mighty chemical messenger: calcium. When calcium levels are just right, it triggers a dance between proteins called actin and myosin, causing our muscles to contract and move us.</p>
<p>But when calcium levels drop, this delicate dance goes haywire. Without enough calcium, muscles go into a frenzy, spasming uncontrollably â€“ this is called <strong>tetany</strong>. Imagine a symphony orchestra where the conductor suddenly disappears, leaving the musicians playing wildly out of sync!</p>
<p>Tetany can disrupt everything from walking to breathing, even becoming life-threatening. So, keeping those calcium levels balanced is crucial for smooth, coordinated movement. </p>
