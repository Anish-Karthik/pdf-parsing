<p>Imagine a muscle as a tiny engine that responds to electrical signals. These signals, called action potentials, are like flicking a switch that makes the muscle contract and then relax.  </p>
<p>A <strong>muscle twitch</strong> is the simplest response â€“  a single flick of the switch. This brief electrical signal causes the muscle to contract quickly and then relax just as quickly.  It's like a single, brief burst of energy.  </p>
<p>So, the statement <strong>"A muscle twitch is a single action potential causing brief contraction and then relaxation"</strong> is <strong>absolutely correct</strong>.  It's the basic building block of muscle activity. </p>
