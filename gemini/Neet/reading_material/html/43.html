<h2>Menopause and Your Bones: The Estrogen Connection</h2>
<p>Menopause, a natural transition marking the end of a woman's menstrual cycle, brings a significant decrease in estrogen levels.  This change has a big impact on bone health. </p>
<p>Why? Because estrogen is a powerful bone protector.  It keeps our bones strong by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building bone:</strong> Estrogen fuels the activity of osteoblasts, the cells that create new bone. </li>
<li><strong>Slowing bone breakdown:</strong> It also keeps osteoclasts, the cells that break down bone, in check.</li>
</ul>
<p>When estrogen levels drop during menopause, this balance is disrupted.  Osteoclasts become more active, leading to accelerated bone loss. At the same time, bone formation slows down. </p>
<p>This double whammy significantly increases the risk of osteoporosis, a condition where bones become weak and brittle, making fractures more likely.  </p>
<p><strong>The takeaway?</strong>  The decrease in estrogen during menopause is a major factor contributing to osteoporosis. </p>
