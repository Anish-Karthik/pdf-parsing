<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that attacks the body's own healthy tissues, especially in the joints.  This attack focuses on the synovial membrane, the thin layer of tissue lining the inside of joints.  The synovial membrane produces synovial fluid, a lubricant that allows for smooth joint movement.</p>
<p>However, in RA, the immune system goes awry. It attacks the synovial membrane, causing it to produce abnormal granules called <strong>pannus</strong>. Pannus is essentially scar tissue composed of inflammatory cells, blood vessels, and fibrous tissue. This abnormal growth spreads over the articular cartilage, the smooth tissue covering the ends of bones within a joint. </p>
<p>Pannus wreaks havoc on the joint:</p>
<ul>
<li>It <strong>erodes cartilage</strong>, leading to joint damage.</li>
<li>It <strong>thickens the synovial membrane</strong>, causing stiffness.</li>
<li>The inflammatory cells within pannus release substances that cause <strong>pain, swelling, and redness</strong>.</li>
<li>Eventually, the joint can become <strong>deformed</strong>, making movement difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The formation of pannus, secreted by the synovial membrane, is a hallmark feature of rheumatoid arthritis.</strong> </p>
