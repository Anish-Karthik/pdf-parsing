<p>Our bodies are powered by muscles, which come in three main types: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. Each type has a unique structure and function. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skeletal muscles</strong> are attached to bones and are responsible for voluntary movements like walking, talking, and lifting. They have a striated appearance due to the arrangement of proteins within their fibers. </li>
<li><strong>Smooth muscles</strong> are found in the walls of internal organs like the stomach, intestines, and blood vessels. They are responsible for involuntary actions like digestion and blood flow regulation. Smooth muscles lack the striations seen in skeletal muscles.</li>
<li><strong>Cardiac muscles</strong> are found only in the heart. They exhibit striations like skeletal muscles, but their contractions are involuntary. </li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>alimentary canal</strong> is the muscular tube that runs from the mouth to the anus, responsible for breaking down food and absorbing nutrients. Its walls are composed of layers of smooth muscle, which contract and relax rhythmically to propel food through the digestive system. </p>
<p><strong>It is incorrect to say that the muscles in the alimentary canal are striated and involuntary.</strong>  These muscles are actually <strong>smooth</strong> and <strong>involuntary</strong>.  </p>
