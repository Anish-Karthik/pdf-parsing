<p>Macrophages and leucocytes are essential components of our immune system, tasked with fighting off infections.  One crucial way they accomplish this is through <strong>amoeboid movement</strong>. </p>
<p>Imagine them as tiny, brave soldiers crawling through the body's tissues.  They extend parts of themselves, called pseudopodia, like little arms, to pull themselves along.  This allows them to reach the site of an infection quickly and efficiently. </p>
<p>Macrophages, specifically, are like the heavy artillery of the immune system. They engulf and destroy harmful invaders through a process called phagocytosis. Their ability to move around freely is critical for finding and eliminating these threats. </p>
<p>So, the answer is <strong>amoeboid movement</strong>. It's a vital characteristic that enables macrophages and leucocytes to do their job and keep us healthy. </p>
