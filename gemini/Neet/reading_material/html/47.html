<p>Our bodies are amazing machines built for movement, and joints are the key to our flexibility.  They allow us to bend, twist, and move freely.</p>
<p>There are different types of joints, but the most common and flexible ones are called <strong>synovial joints</strong>. These joints have a special fluid-filled space called the <strong>synovial cavity</strong> that helps them move smoothly. They are also covered with a smooth layer called <strong>articular cartilage</strong> which protects the bones.</p>
<p>However, not all joints are synovial. For example, the <strong>joints between adjacent vertebrae</strong> in our spine are <strong>cartilaginous joints</strong>. These joints are held together by <strong>intervertebral discs</strong> made of a special type of cartilage, which allows for some movement but not as much as synovial joints.</p>
<p><strong>So, the answer is: Joints between adjacent vertebrae are not an example of synovial joints.</strong></p>
