<h2>The Shoulder Joint: Where the Humerus Meets the Scapula</h2>
<p>Imagine your arm. The long bone in your upper arm is the humerus. At its top, you'll find a rounded ball called the head of the humerus. This ball fits perfectly into a shallow cup-shaped socket called the glenoid cavity, located on the scapula (shoulder blade). This connection is crucial for the movement of your arm.</p>
<p>The scapula and the clavicle (collarbone) make up the pectoral girdle, which acts like a bridge connecting your arm to your torso. The shoulder joint, where the head of the humerus meets the glenoid cavity, is a ball-and-socket joint. This design allows your arm to move in almost every direction, making it incredibly flexible. </p>
<p>So, the statement "<strong>Head of humerus bone articulates with the glenoid cavity of pectoral girdle</strong>" is <strong>TRUE</strong>. This articulation forms the shoulder joint, a vital structure enabling the complex movement of your arm. </p>
