<p>The knee cap, or patella, is a small, triangular bone that sits in front of the knee joint. While it's often called a "modified tendon," this isn't entirely accurate.  The patella is actually a <strong>sesamoid bone</strong>, meaning it's a small, round bone embedded within a tendon â€“ in this case, the <strong>quadriceps tendon</strong>. </p>
<p>So, while it's part of the tendon system, the patella itself is <strong>formed from bone</strong>, not modified tendon. It's a crucial part of the knee, protecting the joint and helping the leg extend efficiently. </p>
