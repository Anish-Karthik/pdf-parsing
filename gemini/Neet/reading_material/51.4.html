<h1>Blood and its Components</h1>

<p>Our blood is a vital fluid that keeps us alive by delivering oxygen and nutrients while removing waste. It's made up of different parts, each with a specific job.</p>

<h2>Key Components of Blood</h2>

<ul>
  <li>*Proteins* are important building blocks found in blood.</li>
  <li>*Antibodies*, a type of protein, are our body's defenders against invaders like bacteria and viruses.</li>
  <li>Blood is a type of *body fluid*, and another important one is *lymph*, which is similar to blood but lacks red blood cells. Lymph collects waste from tissues and takes it to the bloodstream.</li>
  <li>*Red blood cells (RBCs)* carry oxygen from our lungs to the rest of our body.</li>
  <li>*Blood plasma* is the liquid part of blood and contains water, proteins, and other dissolved substances.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blood Groups and Rh Factor</h2>

<ul>
  <li>*Blood group* is based on the presence or absence of specific *antigens* on the surface of RBCs. The most common blood groups are A, B, AB, and O.</li>
  <li>*Rh factor* is another antigen found on RBCs. People can be either *Rh positive* (having the Rh factor) or *Rh negative* (lacking it).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blood Transfusion and Compatibility</h2>

<ul>
  <li>*Blood transfusion*, giving blood from one person to another, is a life-saving procedure. However, it's crucial that the donor and recipient have compatible blood groups. If the recipient has antibodies against the donor's blood group, it can cause a dangerous reaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Erythroblastosis Foetalis</h2>

<ul>
  <li>*Erythroblastosis foetalis* is a serious condition that can happen during pregnancy if the mother is Rh negative and the fetus is Rh positive. The mother's body can develop antibodies against the fetus's Rh factor, which can harm the fetus's red blood cells.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blood Analysis</h2>

<ul>
  <li>*Blood analysis* is a way to check a person's health by testing different parts of their blood, like red and white blood cells, proteins, and antibodies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blood Group 'O' - The Universal Donor</h2>

<ul>
  <li>*Blood group 'O'* is the universal donor because it lacks both A and B antigens, making it safe for transfusion to people with any blood group.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rh Negative Mothers and Rh Positive Fetuses</h2>

<ul>
  <li>*Rh negative* mothers who have an *Rh positive* fetus during a second pregnancy are at risk of Erythroblastosis foetalis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blood Transfusion Compatibility Example</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A person with blood group A positive (*A antigens and Rh factor* on RBCs and *B antibodies* in plasma) should not donate blood to someone with *A negative* blood. This is because the Rh factor could cause a reaction in the recipient.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lymph vs. Blood</h2>

<ul>
  <li>*Lymph* has less protein and more waste products than blood.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blood Group Determination</h2>

<ul>
  <li>*Blood groups* are determined by the presence of antigens on the surface of red blood cells, not the antibodies in the plasma.</li>
</ul>
