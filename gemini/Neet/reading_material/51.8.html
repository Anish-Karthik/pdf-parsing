<h1>The Human Heart</h1>

The human heart is a powerful pump that keeps our blood flowing. It's a four-chambered organ, with two upper chambers called *atria* and two lower chambers called *ventricles*. 

The heart is protected by a double-walled sac called the *pericardium*, which cushions and lubricates it, preventing friction during contractions. 

The heart walls are made of three layers:

* **Epicardium:** This is the outermost layer, like a thin protective shield.
* **Myocardium:** This middle layer is responsible for the heart's powerful contractions. It's thicker in the ventricles, especially the left ventricle, which pumps oxygenated blood to the entire body.
* **Endocardium:** The smooth inner layer, which prevents blood clotting and ensures smooth blood flow.

The heart plays a crucial role in double circulation, where blood travels through the heart twice in one complete cycle. The left ventricle, the strongest chamber, pumps oxygenated blood to the body. The right ventricle pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs for re-oxygenation.

The heart's contractions are controlled by a specialized conducting system, including the *Purkinje fibres* located in the ventricular walls. These fibres help transmit electrical signals that trigger contractions. 

*Blood pressure* is the force of blood against the walls of blood vessels. It's measured as two numbers: *systolic pressure* (when the heart contracts) and *diastolic pressure* (when the heart relaxes). The difference between these two is called *pulse pressure*, which indicates the strength of the heart's contractions.

The *left auricle* and *left ventricle* in higher vertebrates are known as the *systemic heart*, as they are responsible for pumping oxygenated blood to the entire body.
