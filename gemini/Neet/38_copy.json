The Two Kingdom System: A Starting Point</strong></p>\n<p>Long ago, scientists like Linnaeus tried to organize living things into groups. They came up with a simple system: <strong>Plantae</strong> for plants and <strong>Animalia</strong> for animals. </p>\n<p><strong>2.  Limitations of the Two Kingdom System</strong></p>\n<p>The Two Kingdom system was a great start, but it didn't consider the differences between simple single-celled organisms and complex multicellular ones. It also didn't recognize the unique features of organisms like fungi!</p>\n<p><strong>3.  Introducing Fungi:  A Unique Kingdom</strong></p>\n<p>Let's take a closer look at a mysterious organism:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cell type:</strong> Eukaryotic (meaning its cells have a nucleus)</li>\n<li><strong>Cell wall:</strong>  Present, but made of chitin, not cellulose (like plants)</li>\n<li><strong>Nuclear membrane:</strong>  Present (its DNA is neatly packaged)</li>\n<li><strong>Body organization:</strong> Multicellular (made of many cells), sometimes loosely organized</li>\n<li><strong>Mode of nutrition:</strong>  Heterotrophic (can't make their own food), either saprophytic (eating dead things) or parasitic (living off other organisms)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4.  Fungi:  Masters of Decomposition</strong></p>\n<p>This set of characteristics fits perfectly with the amazing kingdom of <strong>Fungi</strong>.
