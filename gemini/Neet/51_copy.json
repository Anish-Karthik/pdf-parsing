It's like a tiny army made up of white blood cells (WBCs), which patrol our body fluids, like blood and lymph. One type of WBC, the T-lymphocyte, helps identify and destroy invaders.  Another important player is the antibody, a protein that can latch onto specific harmful substances, marking them for destruction.  While T-lymphocytes don't produce antibodies, they are a crucial part of the immune response. </p>\n<p><strong>The incorrect match is:</strong> T-Lymphocytes - Produce antibodies. </p>",
