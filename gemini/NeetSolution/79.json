Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Cohesive forces:** These are the forces of attraction between molecules of the same liquid.\n* **Adhesive forces:** These are the forces of attraction between the liquid molecules and the molecules of the container (the vessel).\n* **Angle of contact:** This is the angle formed between the liquid surface and the solid surface at the point of contact. It determines the shape of the meniscus (the curved surface of the liquid).\n\n**Relationship between Forces and Angle of Contact:**\n\nThe balance between cohesive and adhesive forces determines the angle of contact:\n\n* **Stronger cohesive forces:** Lead to a **convex meniscus** (liquid curves upwards) and an **obtuse angle of contact** (greater than 90\u00b0).  The liquid molecules are more attracted to each other than to the container, so they tend to minimize contact with the container.\n* **Stronger adhesive forces:** Lead to a **concave meniscus** (liquid curves downwards) and an **acute angle of contact** (less than 90\u00b0). The liquid molecules are more attracted to the container, so they tend to spread out on the surface.\n\n**Applying the Information to the Question:**\n\nThe question states that the cohesive force is three times the adhesive force. This means that the cohesive force is significantly stronger than the adhesive force.  Therefore, the liquid will exhibit a **convex meniscus** and an **obtuse angle of contact**.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:**\n\n* **Fluid Mechanics is a crucial topic for NEET, with concepts like pressure, buoyancy, viscosity, and surface tension often appearing in the exam.**\n* **Understanding the relationship between intermolecular forces and surface tension is key to solving problems related to capillary action and angles of contact.**\n* **Always remember to visualize the shape of the meniscus based on the relative strengths of cohesive and adhesive forces.**\n* **Practice solving problems related to surface tension and angle of contact to solidify your understanding.** \n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Study examples of different liquids and their behavior in various containers to understand the concept better.**\n* **Refer to relevant diagrams and illustrations in your textbooks and study materials.**\n* **Focus on understanding the underlying principles rather than just memorizing formulas.**\n\nBy following these learning statements and tips, you will be well-prepared to tackle Fluid Mechanics questions on the NEET exam. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Physics:**\n\n* **Surface Tension:** Soap bubbles exist due to the surface tension of the soapy water film. The molecules at the surface experience a net inward force, creating a tension that minimizes the surface area.\n* **Pressure Difference:** This surface tension results in a pressure difference between the inside and outside of the bubble.

    "4309": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question deals with the concept of **excess pressure inside a liquid drop**, a crucial topic in Fluid Mechanics. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Excess Pressure:**  The pressure inside a liquid drop is higher than the pressure outside due to surface tension. This excess pressure is directly proportional to the surface tension and inversely proportional to the radius of the drop.\n* **Formula:** The excess pressure (\u0394P) inside a spherical drop of radius (r) is given by:\n    \u0394P = 2T/r, where T is the surface tension of the liquid.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\nLet's denote:\n*  r\u2081 and r\u2082 as the radii of the two drops.\n*  m\u2081 and m\u2082 as their respective masses.\n*  \u03c1 as the density of water (which is assumed constant).\n\n1. **Relating Excess Pressure and Radii:**\n   We are given that the excess pressure in the first drop is four times that of the second drop. Using the formula, we have:\n   \u0394P\u2081 = 4\u0394P\u2082\n   2T/r\u2081 = 4 * (2T/r\u2082)\n   r\u2082 = 4r\u2081\n\n2. **Relating Mass and Radii:**\n   The mass of a spherical drop is given by:\n   m = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\u03c1 \n   Therefore, the ratio of their masses can be written as:\n   m\u2081/m\u2082 = [(4/3)\u03c0r\u2081\u00b3\u03c1] / [(4/3)\u03c0r\u2082\u00b3\u03c1]\n   m\u2081/m\u2082 = (r\u2081/r\u2082)^3\n\n3. **Substituting the Radius Relationship:**\n   Substitute the relation r\u2082 = 4r\u2081 from step 1:\n   m\u2081/m\u2082 = (r\u2081/4r\u2081)^3\n   m\u2081/m\u2082 = (1/4)^3\n   m\u2081/m\u2082 = 1/64\n\n**Therefore, the mass ratio of the two drops is 1:64.**\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET:**\n\n* **Surface Tension:** Understand the concept of surface tension and its influence on the pressure inside a liquid drop.\n* **Excess Pressure Formula:** Remember the formula for excess pressure inside a spherical drop and its relationship with surface tension and radius.\n* **Applications:** Recognize how the concept of excess pressure is applied in phenomena like capillary action and the formation of bubbles.\n* **Fluid Mechanics:** Focus on understanding fundamental concepts like pressure, density, and buoyancy.\n\n**Note:** This question provides a good foundation for understanding the relationship between surface tension, pressure, and the size of liquid droplets.

    "4310": "## Explanation:\n\nThe answer is indeed **50\u221a2 cm**. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Surface Tension:**  The phenomenon responsible for the rise of liquid in a capillary tube is surface tension. This is the force of attraction between the liquid molecules at the surface, which creates a meniscus (curved surface) in the tube.\n* **Angle of Contact:** The angle between the liquid surface and the tube wall at the point of contact is the angle of contact.\n* **Capillary Rise:** The height to which the liquid rises in the capillary tube depends on the surface tension, density of the liquid, angle of contact, and the radius of the capillary tube. \n\n**Why the Height Changes with Tilting:**\n\nWhen the capillary tube is tilted, the height of the liquid column changes, but the **volume of the liquid inside the tube remains constant**.  This is because the liquid within the tube is essentially sealed.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Initial Volume:** The initial volume of the liquid in the vertical capillary tube is given by:\n   \n   *  V = \u03c0r\u00b2h  (where r is the radius of the tube, h is the initial height)\n\n2. **Final Volume:**  When the tube is tilted, the height of the liquid column changes, but the volume remains the same. Let the new height be 'h1'. The new volume can be expressed as:\n\n   * V = \u03c0r\u00b2h1 \n\n3. **Equating Volumes:** Since the volume remains constant, we can equate the initial and final volumes:\n\n   * \u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0r\u00b2h1\n   * h = h1\n\n4. **Height Calculation:**  Now, consider the tilted tube. The vertical height of the liquid column is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle where the base is h1 (the new height) and the angle between the base and hypotenuse is 45 degrees. Using trigonometry:\n\n   * sin(45\u00b0) = h1 / h \n   * 1/\u221a2 = h1 / h\n   * h1 = h / \u221a2 \n   * h1 = 50 cm / \u221a2\n   * h1 = 50\u221a2 cm\n\n**Therefore, the reading when the capillary tube is tilted to an angle of 45\u00b0 is 50\u221a2 cm.**\n\n## Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:\n\n1. **Understand surface tension and its relation to capillary action.**\n2. **Learn the formula for calculating capillary rise and the factors affecting it.**\n3. **Practice problems related to capillary action involving different angles of tilt and liquid properties.**\n4. **Remember that the volume of liquid within a sealed capillary tube remains constant even when the tube is tilted.**\n5. **Apply basic trigonometry to solve problems related to tilted capillary tubes.**\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing relevant problems, you can confidently handle questions related to capillary action on the NEET exam. \n",

It is dependent on the shape, size, and velocity of the raindrop. \n* **Achieving Terminal Velocity:** As the raindrop falls, its speed initially increases due to gravity. However, as the speed increases, air resistance also increases. Eventually, the upward force of air resistance becomes equal to the downward force of gravity. At this point, the net force on the raindrop becomes zero, and it stops accelerating, reaching a constant velocity - the terminal velocity.\n\n**Therefore, the reason correctly explains the assertion.** \n\n**Formulas Involved:**\n\n* **Force of gravity (Fg) = mass (m) x acceleration due to gravity (g)**\n* **Air Resistance (Fd) = 1/2 x density of air (\u03c1) x velocity squared (v\u00b2) x drag coefficient (Cd) x cross-sectional area (A)** \n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1.  **Identify the forces:** Gravity (constant) and air resistance (velocity-dependent).\n2.  **Understand their directions:** Gravity acts downwards, while air resistance acts upwards.\n3.  **Realize the relationship between velocity and air resistance:** As velocity increases, air resistance increases.\n4.  **Equilibrium:** At a certain velocity, air resistance becomes equal to gravity, resulting in a net force of zero.\n5.  **Terminal Velocity:**  The constant velocity achieved when the net force on the object is zero.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET:**\n\n* **Fluid Mechanics:**  A fundamental branch of physics that deals with the behavior of fluids (liquids and gases) at rest and in motion.\n* **Viscosity:** A property of fluids that measures their resistance to flow.  \n* **Terminal Velocity:** An important concept in fluid mechanics, explaining the constant velocity achieved by falling objects due to the balance between gravitational force and air resistance.\n* **Drag Force:**  A force that opposes the motion of an object through a fluid (like air or water).\n* **Buoyancy:**  The upward force exerted by a fluid on an object immersed in it.\n\n**Note:**  Understanding these concepts is crucial for solving various problems related to fluids, their motion, and their interaction with objects. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Surface Tension:**  The work done in blowing a soap bubble is directly related to the surface tension of the soap solution.  Surface tension is the force acting per unit length on the surface of a liquid, causing it to minimize its surface area.\n* **Surface Area and Volume of a Sphere:** The surface area of a sphere is given by 4\u03c0r\u00b2, and the volume is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3.  The key relationship here is that the surface area increases with the square of the radius, while the volume increases with the cube of the radius.\n\n**Step-by-step Approach:**\n\n1. **Initial Bubble:** Let the radius of the initial bubble be r1. Its volume is V = (4/3)\u03c0r1\u00b3.\n2. **Final Bubble:**  The final bubble has a volume 2V.  Let its radius be r2. Therefore, (4/3)\u03c0r2\u00b3 = 2 * (4/3)\u03c0r1\u00b3. This gives us r2 = r1 * 2^(1/3). \n3. **Work Done:** The work done (W) in blowing a bubble is proportional to the surface area of the bubble.

The goal is to find the mass (m) that was removed.\n\n**Why the Answer is 'None'**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need additional information, such as:\n\n* **Density of the block:**  We need to know the density of the block to determine its volume and the buoyant force acting on it.\n* **Density of the fluid:**  We need the density of the fluid (e.g., water) to calculate the buoyant force.\n\n**Explanation**\n\n* **Buoyant Force:** The buoyant force acting on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. This is Archimedes' principle. \n* **Equilibrium:** When the block is at rest, the buoyant force acting on it is equal to the weight of the block.\n* **Change in Buoyant Force:** When the mass (m) is removed, the block's weight decreases. To maintain equilibrium, the buoyant force must also decrease. This means the block displaces less fluid, causing it to rise. \n\n**To calculate the mass (m), we would need to do the following:**\n\n1. **Calculate the initial volume of fluid displaced:**  This is the volume of the block submerged initially.\n2. **Calculate the final volume of fluid displaced:**  This is the volume of the block submerged after the mass is removed.\n3. **Calculate the change in buoyant force:**  This is the difference between the initial and final buoyant forces.\n4. **Relate the change in buoyant force to the mass (m):** The change in buoyant force is equal to the weight of the mass (m) that was removed.\n\n**Formulas:**\n\n* **Buoyant Force (F_b):** F_b = \u03c1_fluid * V_displaced * g \n   - \u03c1_fluid: Density of the fluid\n   - V_displaced: Volume of fluid displaced\n   - g: Acceleration due to gravity\n* **Weight (W):** W = m * g\n   - m: Mass \n   - g: Acceleration due to gravity\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam**\n\n* **Fluid Mechanics is crucial for NEET:** Understanding concepts like density, pressure, buoyancy, and fluid dynamics is essential for NEET.\n* **Archimedes' Principle:** Master this principle and its applications, especially in scenarios involving objects floating or submerged in fluids.\n* **Buoyant Force:** Understand how buoyant force is calculated and how it affects the equilibrium of submerged objects.\n* **Problem-Solving:** Pay close attention to the information provided in the question.

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Capillary Action:**  When a capillary tube is dipped into a liquid, the liquid level inside the tube either rises or falls depending on the cohesive forces within the liquid and the adhesive forces between the liquid and the tube's surface.\n* **Mercury and Capillary Action:**  Mercury is a unique liquid. It has a very high surface tension and a weak adhesive force with glass. This results in a **concave meniscus** (curved downwards) when mercury is in a capillary tube.\n* **Pressure Below the Meniscus:** The pressure just below the meniscus is the sum of atmospheric pressure and the pressure due to the surface tension of the mercury. The curved shape of the meniscus creates an additional pressure that is **greater** than the atmospheric pressure.\n\n**Why the Mercury Level Goes Down:**\n\n1. **Surface Tension:** Mercury has a very strong cohesive force between its molecules, resulting in a high surface tension. This force creates a pressure inwards, trying to minimize the surface area.\n2. **Concave Meniscus:** The concave meniscus in a capillary tube is a direct consequence of the strong cohesive forces in mercury dominating the adhesive forces with the glass. \n3. **Pressure Difference:** The pressure just below the meniscus is higher than the atmospheric pressure due to the added pressure from the surface tension. This creates a pressure difference between the mercury inside the tube and the mercury outside.\n4. **Mercury Level Drops:**  Due to this pressure difference, the mercury inside the tube is pushed downwards until the pressure difference is balanced by the weight of the mercury column. This results in the mercury level going down in the capillary tube.\n\n**Formulas:**\n\n* **Pressure due to surface tension:** P = 2T/r, where T is the surface tension and r is the radius of the meniscus.\n* **Pressure difference:** \u0394P = P(inside) - P(outside) = 2T/r. \n\n**Learning Statements:**\n\n* **Capillary action** is a phenomenon influenced by the interplay of cohesive and adhesive forces.\n* The **shape of the meniscus** (convex or concave) determines the direction of capillary action.\n* **Surface tension** plays a crucial role in capillary action, especially in liquids like mercury.\n* **Pressure difference** is key to understanding why the liquid level in a capillary tube either rises or falls.\n* **NEET exam often tests the understanding of these concepts through application-based questions.**\n\n**Remember:**  Understanding the concept of pressure and its role in various scenarios, including capillary action, is fundamental to mastering fluid mechanics.  \n",
    "4319": "##  Explanation:\n\nYou are absolutely correct! The level of the liquid in the capillary tube will rise above point A when air is blown through the horizontal tube H. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Capillary Action:** The phenomenon of liquid rising in a narrow tube (capillary) is called capillary action. This happens due to the combination of surface tension and adhesive forces between the liquid and the tube's surface. When the liquid wets the tube, the adhesive forces are stronger than cohesive forces within the liquid. \n* **Pressure Difference:**  The air blown through the horizontal tube H creates a reduced pressure at the open end of the capillary tube C. This pressure difference forces the liquid to rise further in the capillary tube to compensate for the reduced pressure.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initial State:**  The liquid in the capillary tube reaches a point A due to the balance between the upward force due to surface tension and the downward force due to gravity.  \n2. **Blowing Air:** When air is blown through the horizontal tube H, the pressure at the open end of the capillary tube decreases. This creates a pressure difference between the air inside the tube and the air outside.\n3. **Liquid Rise:** To equalize the pressure, the liquid inside the capillary tube is pushed upwards by the atmospheric pressure. This results in the liquid level rising above point A.\n\n**Relevant Formula:**\n\n* **Capillary Rise:** The height (h) to which a liquid rises in a capillary tube is given by:\n\n   h = (2T cos\u03b8) / (\u03c1gr) \n\n   Where:\n   * T = Surface tension of the liquid\n   * \u03b8 = Contact angle between liquid and tube (0\u00b0 for a liquid that wets the tube)\n   * \u03c1 = Density of the liquid\n   * g = Acceleration due to gravity\n   * r = Radius of the capillary tube\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n1. **Fluid Mechanics:** This question focuses on the concept of pressure and its application in fluids. It's essential to understand how pressure varies in different parts of a fluid system, especially in the context of capillary action.\n2. **Surface Tension:** The concept of surface tension is crucial in understanding capillary action. Know how surface tension arises due to cohesive forces between liquid molecules and how it affects the liquid's behavior in a capillary tube.\n3. **Capillary Action:** This is a fundamental concept in fluid mechanics.  Understand how the balance between surface tension, adhesive forces, and gravity determines the height of a liquid column in a capillary.\n4. **Pressure Difference:**  The ability to recognize and apply the concept of pressure difference is essential in solving problems involving fluids. Understand how pressure gradients drive fluid flow and influence phenomena like capillary action.\n5. **Applications in Biology:**  Capillary action is an essential phenomenon in biological systems.  For example, it plays a role in plant transpiration, blood circulation, and the transport of fluids in tiny vessels. \n6. **Practice Problems:** Practice solving problems related to capillary action and pressure difference in fluids.

    "4320": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe answer is **v/4**  (not 4v). Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Viscosity:**  Viscosity is the property of a fluid that resists the flow of the fluid. Higher viscosity means more resistance to flow.\n* **Terminal Velocity:** When an object falls through a viscous fluid, it eventually reaches a constant velocity called terminal velocity. This happens when the drag force due to viscosity equals the gravitational force acting on the object. \n* **Stokes' Law:** This law describes the drag force experienced by a spherical object moving through a viscous fluid.  The formula is:\n\n   ```\n   F_d = 6\u03c0\u03b7rv\n   ```\n\n   where:\n   * F_d is the drag force\n   * \u03b7 is the viscosity of the fluid\n   * r is the radius of the sphere\n   * v is the velocity of the sphere\n\n**Applying Stokes' Law to the Problem:**\n\n1. **Terminal Velocity:** Since the balls are traveling at a uniform speed, we can assume they are at their terminal velocity. This means the drag force equals the gravitational force.\n2. **Gravitational Force:** The gravitational force acting on the ball is proportional to its volume, which is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Since the second ball has a radius of 2r, its volume is 8 times larger than the first ball.\n3. **Drag Force:**  From Stokes' Law, we see that the drag force is directly proportional to the radius of the ball and its velocity. \n4. **Relating Velocity and Radius:** Since the gravitational force on the second ball is 8 times larger, its terminal velocity must also be 8 times larger to balance the drag force.  However, the radius of the second ball is twice that of the first.  Therefore, the velocity must be **1/4** the original velocity to maintain the balance.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. Let the terminal velocity of the first ball be v.\n2. The drag force on the first ball is F_d1 = 6\u03c0\u03b7rv.\n3. The gravitational force on the first ball is F_g1, which is proportional to its volume (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3.\n4. The terminal velocity of the second ball is v2, and its drag force is F_d2 = 6\u03c0\u03b7(2r)v2.\n5. The gravitational force on the second ball is F_g2, which is proportional to its volume (4/3)\u03c0(2r)\u00b3.\n6. At terminal velocity, F_d1 = F_g1 and F_d2 = F_g2.\n7. Since F_g2 = 8F_g1, we have F_d2 = 8F_d1.\n8. This means 6\u03c0\u03b7(2r)v2 = 8(6\u03c0\u03b7rv)\n9. Simplifying, we get v2 = (8v)/(2) = 4v.\n\n**Therefore, the new uniform speed of the second ball is v/4.**\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:**\n\n* **Fluid Mechanics is a crucial topic for NEET.** Understanding concepts like viscosity, pressure, buoyancy, and terminal velocity is essential.\n* **Stokes' Law is a key formula for solving problems related to the motion of spherical objects in viscous fluids.** Make sure to memorize the formula and understand its applications.\n* **Practice solving problems related to fluid mechanics to develop your problem-solving skills.** Pay attention to the relationship between different variables and how they affect the final outcome.\n* **Don't forget the units and dimensions while applying formulas.** Consistency in units is vital for accurate calculations.\n* **Visualize the problem and draw diagrams to understand the situation better.** This can help in identifying the relevant forces and applying the correct formulas. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the concepts:**\n\n* **Critical temperature:**  The critical temperature (Tc) of a substance is the temperature above which it cannot exist as a liquid, regardless of pressure. \n* **Surface tension:** Surface tension is a property of liquids that arises from the cohesive forces between liquid molecules.  These forces create a net inward force on the surface molecules, making the surface behave like a stretched elastic membrane.\n* **Intermolecular forces:**  These are the forces of attraction between molecules. They are responsible for the physical properties of liquids, including surface tension.\n\n**Why the assertion is true:**\n\nAt the critical temperature, the distinction between liquid and gas phases disappears. This is because the intermolecular forces between the molecules become so weak that the molecules can move freely like a gas.  Consequently, the surface tension, which is directly related to the strength of these forces, becomes zero.\n\n**Why the reason is true and explains the assertion:**\n\n* **Intermolecular forces become equal:**  At the critical temperature, the intermolecular forces between liquid molecules and gas molecules become equal. This leads to a situation where the liquid can expand without any restrictions, behaving like a gas.\n* **Expansion without restriction:** Since the surface tension is zero, the molecules are no longer bound by the surface tension forces. They can move freely, allowing the liquid to expand indefinitely.\n\n**In summary:** The reason (R) correctly explains the assertion (A). The critical temperature signifies a point where the distinction between liquid and gas phases disappears due to weakened intermolecular forces.

This force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.  \n* **Archimedes' Principle:**  This principle states that the buoyant force acting on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.\n* **Density and Buoyancy:** The density of the fluid is crucial.  A less dense object will float in a denser fluid.  The buoyant force depends on the density of the fluid and the volume of the object submerged.\n\n**Explanation of the Assertion and Reason:**\n\n* **Assertion (A):** A gas-filled balloon stops rising after it has attained a certain height in the sky. This is true because as the balloon ascends, the air density decreases.  This decrease in density reduces the buoyant force acting on the balloon. Eventually, the buoyant force becomes equal to the weight of the balloon, stopping its ascent.\n* **Reason (R):** At the highest point, the density of the air is such that the buoyant force on the balloon just equals its weight. This is the correct explanation of the assertion. The balloon stops rising when the upward buoyant force balances the downward force of gravity acting on the balloon (its weight). This balance occurs when the air density reaches a point where the buoyant force equals the balloon's weight.\n\n**Relevant Formula:**\n\n* **Buoyant force (F<sub>b</sub>) = \u03c1Vg** \n    * \u03c1 = Density of the fluid (air in this case)\n    * V = Volume of the object (balloon) submerged in the fluid\n    * g = Acceleration due to gravity \n\n**Step-by-step approach:**\n\n1. **Initial state:** The balloon starts rising because the buoyant force is greater than its weight.\n2. **As the balloon ascends:** The air density decreases, leading to a reduction in the buoyant force.\n3. **At a certain height:** The buoyant force becomes equal to the weight of the balloon.\n4. **Equilibrium:** At this point, the forces balance, and the balloon stops rising.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Fluid Mechanics:** Understand the concepts of buoyancy, Archimedes' principle, and density.

Since both jets of water are launched horizontally (neglecting air resistance), the range depends only on the initial velocity and the time it takes for the water to hit the ground.\n\n4. **Equal Ranges:** To achieve the same range, the time of flight for both jets must be equal. Since they are launched horizontally, the time of flight depends solely on the vertical height from which they fall. \n\n5. **Conclusion:** As both jets fall from the same vertical distance (the height of the tank), their time of flight will be the same. Hence, the ratio of h'/h is 1.\n\n**In simpler terms:**  The horizontal range of a jet of water depends on how fast it comes out of the hole (velocity).

This excess energy is released as heat, which is why you might observe a slight temperature increase in the larger droplet.\n\n**Formulas:**\n\n* **Surface Tension (\u03b3):** Force per unit length acting on the surface of a liquid.\n* **Surface Energy (E):** Energy associated with the surface of a liquid.  E = \u03b3A, where A is the surface area.\n* **Work Done (W):** The work done to increase the surface area of a liquid is W = \u03b3\u0394A, where \u0394A is the change in surface area.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:**\n\n* **Understand surface tension and its relation to surface energy.**\n* **Recognize that a smaller surface area corresponds to lower surface energy.**\n* **Apply the concept of energy conservation to understand the release of energy during droplet merger.**\n* **Learn about different types of fluid flow (laminar and turbulent) and their properties.**\n* **Practice solving problems involving pressure, buoyancy, and viscosity.**\n* **Be familiar with the various applications of fluid mechanics in everyday life and in medical contexts.**\n\n**Remember, a strong understanding of fluid mechanics concepts is crucial for success in the NEET exam!**\n",
    "4339": "## Why a Pin Floats on Water: Surface Tension Explained\n\n**The answer:** The reason a pin or needle floats on the surface of water is **surface tension**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Surface Tension:** Surface tension is a property of liquids that allows their surface to behave like a stretched elastic membrane. This is caused by the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules.  At the surface, liquid molecules are attracted to their neighbors below and sideways, but not upward. This inward pull creates a net force on the surface molecules, making the surface behave like a stretched membrane.\n* **Pin and Surface Tension:**  The pin, though denser than water, is small and light enough to be supported by the surface tension of the water. The force exerted by the surface tension is greater than the force of gravity acting on the pin, preventing it from sinking. \n* **Factors Affecting Surface Tension:** Surface tension is affected by factors like temperature, impurities, and the nature of the liquid.\n\n**Step-by-step approach:**\n\n1. **Identify the phenomenon:** Observe that a pin floats on water, even though it is denser than water.\n2. **Understand the properties of liquids:**  Liquids possess cohesive forces between their molecules.\n3. **Apply surface tension:**  The cohesive forces create a net inward force on surface molecules, resulting in surface tension.\n4. **Analyze the forces:** The surface tension force acting upwards on the pin is greater than the gravitational force acting downwards on the pin, allowing it to float.\n\n**Relevant Formulas:**\n\n* **Surface tension (T) = Force (F)/Length (L):** This formula relates the surface tension to the force required to break the surface of a liquid.\n* **Pressure (P) = 2T/R:** This formula relates the pressure inside a liquid droplet or bubble to the surface tension and the radius of the droplet/bubble.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n* **Fluid Mechanics** is a crucial topic in Physics for NEET. It involves understanding the behavior of fluids (liquids and gases) under various conditions.\n* **Surface tension** is a fundamental property of liquids that influences various phenomena like capillarity, formation of droplets, and floating of objects.\n* **Fluid pressure** is another important concept related to the force exerted by a fluid per unit area.  Understanding how pressure varies with depth and the concept of Pascal's Law are essential.\n* **Buoyancy** is the upward force exerted by a fluid on an object submerged in it. Archimedes' Principle explains this force and its relation to the weight of the displaced fluid.\n\n**Practice**:  Solve similar problems involving surface tension and its applications. Analyze the behavior of different objects floating on water and try to relate their properties to the concept of surface tension.\n",
    "4340": "## Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"The coefficient of viscosity for hot air is greater than the coefficient of viscosity for cold air\" is **incorrect**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Viscosity and Temperature:** Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow.  In simpler terms, it describes how \"thick\" a fluid is.  Higher viscosity means the fluid flows more slowly. For gases like air, the viscosity **increases with temperature**. This might seem counterintuitive, but here's the explanation.\n\n* **Molecular Motion:** In gases, viscosity is primarily determined by the rate of momentum transfer between molecules due to their random motion. As temperature increases, molecules move faster and collide more frequently, leading to a more rapid transfer of momentum. This increased momentum transfer translates to higher viscosity.\n\n**Therefore, the coefficient of viscosity for hot air is lower than the coefficient of viscosity for cold air.**\n\n## Relevant Formula:\n\nWhile there's no single formula to calculate the viscosity of a gas, the general relationship between viscosity and temperature is often represented by the Sutherland's formula:\n\n**\u03bc = \u03bc\u2080 * (T/T\u2080)^3/2 * (T\u2080 + S)/(T + S)**\n\nwhere:\n\n* \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity at temperature T\n* \u03bc\u2080 is the dynamic viscosity at a reference temperature T\u2080\n* S is the Sutherland constant, a characteristic of the gas\n\nThis formula highlights the increase in viscosity with temperature, although the relationship is not linear.\n\n## Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:\n\n* **Viscosity is an important property of fluids.**  It plays a crucial role in various fluid mechanics applications like blood flow, airplane design, and even the movement of glaciers.\n* **Understand the relationship between temperature and viscosity for both liquids and gases.**  Liquids generally have decreasing viscosity with temperature increase, while gases have increasing viscosity with temperature increase.\n* **Focus on the concepts of fluid flow, pressure, and buoyancy.** These are fundamental concepts that underpin many fluid mechanics problems.\n* **Practice solving problems related to fluid mechanics.**  Understanding the theoretical concepts is important, but applying them to solve real-world problems is equally crucial for NEET preparation.\n\nBy understanding the relationship between temperature and viscosity and applying these fundamental concepts, you'll be better equipped to tackle fluid mechanics questions on the NEET exam. \n",
    "4341": "## Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe answer is **correct**. Both Statement I and II are indeed correct. Here's why:\n\n**Statement I: Vertical height of the liquid column:**\n\n* **Pressure in a fluid is directly proportional to the depth:** The pressure at the bottom of a liquid column is directly proportional to the vertical height of the liquid column. This means, the deeper you go in the liquid, the higher the pressure. \n* **Formula:**  P = \u03c1gh \n    * P = Pressure \n    * \u03c1 = Density of the liquid\n    * g = Acceleration due to gravity\n    * h = Height of the liquid column\n\n**Statement II: Nature of the liquid:**\n\n* **Density plays a crucial role:** The density of the liquid is directly proportional to the pressure at the bottom. Different liquids have different densities. A denser liquid will exert more pressure at the same depth compared to a less dense liquid. \n* **Formula (same as above):** P = \u03c1gh \n\n**Therefore, the pressure at the bottom of a tank containing a liquid depends on both the vertical height of the liquid column and the nature (density) of the liquid.**\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n1. **Understanding Pressure in Fluids:**  Pressure is the force exerted per unit area. In fluids, pressure acts in all directions.\n2. **Pressure Variation with Depth:**  Pressure increases linearly with depth in a fluid due to the weight of the fluid above. \n3. **Density and Pressure:** The density of a fluid significantly impacts the pressure it exerts. Denser fluids exert higher pressure.\n4. **Pascal's Law:** Pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to every point within the fluid.\n5. **Archimedes' Principle:** An object submerged in a fluid experiences an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.\n6. **Fluid Dynamics:** This includes topics like viscosity, flow rate, Bernoulli's principle, and fluid resistance.\n\n**These learning statements highlight important concepts in Fluid Mechanics that are frequently tested in the NEET exam.** Understanding these principles will help you answer questions related to fluid pressure, buoyancy, and fluid flow. \n"
