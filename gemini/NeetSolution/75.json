This force is responsible for keeping the motorcycle in contact with the track.\n\n**Minimum Speed Condition:**\n\nFor the motorcycle to complete the loop without falling, the centripetal force required to keep it moving in a circle must be greater than or equal to the force of gravity.  At the minimum speed, the normal force becomes zero. This is because any lower speed would mean the force of gravity would be stronger, and the motorcycle would fall.\n\n**Applying the Formulas:**\n\n1. **Centripetal Force:** The force required to keep an object moving in a circle is called the centripetal force.

Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Conservation of Energy:** The key to solving this problem lies in understanding that the total mechanical energy of the body remains constant throughout its journey. This means the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE) remains the same.\n* **Circular Motion:** As the body enters the loop, it experiences a centripetal force that keeps it moving in a circular path. This force is provided by the normal force from the track.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n* **At the Highest Point of the Loop:**\n    * Let the speed of the body at the highest point of the loop be 'v'.\n    * At this point, the body's PE is maximum (mgh) and its KE is minimum (1/2mv^2).\n    * The centripetal force required for circular motion is provided by the normal force (N) and the weight of the body (mg): N + mg = mv^2/R (where R = D/2 is the radius of the loop).\n    * To just complete the loop, the normal force (N) must be at least zero. Therefore, mg = mv^2/R.\n* **At the Initial Point:**\n    * At the initial height 'h', the body only has PE (mgh) and no KE.\n* **Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n    * Initial total energy (PE at h) = Final total energy (PE + KE at the highest point of the loop)\n    * mgh = mgD + 1/2mv^2 \n    * From the previous step, we know mg = mv^2/R, so substituting: \n        * mgh = mgD + 1/2(mgR)\n        * h = D + R/2\n        * h = D + (D/2)/2\n        * **h = 5D/4**\n\n**3.

    "4215": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis problem involves the concept of conservation of linear momentum, centripetal force, and the dynamics of circular motion. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Analyzing the situation**\n\n* Initially, the 2.9 kg mass is at rest, hanging vertically. This means the tension in the string is equal to the gravitational force acting on it (T = mg).\n* The 0.1 kg mass hits the hanging mass horizontally, causing both masses to move together in a circular path. This is because the string acts as a constraint, forcing the combined mass to move in a circular arc.\n* The final angle of 60\u00b0 with the vertical indicates the point in the circular path where we need to find the tension.\n\n**Step 2: Applying Conservation of Linear Momentum**\n\n* Before the collision, the horizontal momentum of the system is only due to the 0.1 kg mass.\n* After the collision, the combined mass (2.9 kg + 0.1 kg = 3 kg) moves with a velocity (v). \n* Applying conservation of linear momentum:\n    * Initial momentum = Final momentum\n    * (0.1 kg)(150 m/s) = (3 kg)(v)\n    * Solving for v, we get v = 5 m/s \n\n**Step 3: Finding the radius of the circular path**\n\n* We know the length of the string (L = 50 cm = 0.5 m) and the angle it makes with the vertical (\u03b8 = 60\u00b0).\n* From the geometry, we can find the radius (r) of the circular path:\n    *  cos \u03b8 = r/L\n    *  r = L cos \u03b8 = 0.5 m * cos 60\u00b0 = 0.25 m\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the centripetal force**\n\n* The combined mass (3 kg) moves in a circular path with velocity (v = 5 m/s) and radius (r = 0.25 m).\n* Centripetal force (Fc) required to keep the mass moving in this circular path is given by:\n    * Fc = (mv^2)/r = (3 kg)(5 m/s)^2 / 0.25 m = 300 N\n\n**Step 5: Resolving the forces at the point of 60\u00b0 angle**\n\n* At this point, the tension in the string (T) acts in the direction of the string. \n* The tension can be resolved into two components:\n    * Vertical component (T cos \u03b8) which balances the gravitational force (mg)\n    * Horizontal component (T sin \u03b8) which provides the centripetal force (Fc) \n\n**Step 6: Calculating the tension (T)**\n\n* We know:\n    * T sin \u03b8 = Fc = 300 N\n    * T cos \u03b8 = mg = (3 kg)(9.8 m/s^2) = 29.4 N\n* Dividing the first equation by the second equation:\n    * tan \u03b8 = Fc / (mg)\n    * tan 60\u00b0 = 300 N / 29.4 N\n    * Solving for T, we get T \u2248 135 N\n\nTherefore, the tension in the string when it makes an angle of 60\u00b0 with the vertical is approximately **135 N**, which is the answer provided. \n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n* **Conservation of linear momentum** is a fundamental principle in physics and is particularly important in collision problems. \n* **Centripetal force** is the force that acts towards the center of a circular path, keeping an object moving in a circle. \n* **Circular motion** is a common phenomenon in nature and is essential for understanding the motion of planets, satellites, and other objects in orbit.\n* **Resolution of forces** is a crucial technique to analyze forces acting at an angle.

    "4216": "Here's a detailed explanation of why the answer is 60\u00b0 and how to approach this problem:\n\n**Understanding the Physics**\n\n* **Forces Involved:** When the pendulum swings, the tension in the string provides the centripetal force needed to keep the sphere moving in a circular arc.  There's also the force of gravity acting on the sphere.\n* **Breaking Strength:** The string will break if the tension in it exceeds 2Mg.  This is the maximum force the string can handle.\n* **Maximum Angular Amplitude:**  We need to find the maximum angle the pendulum can swing from the vertical before the string breaks.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. **Free Body Diagram:** Draw a free body diagram of the sphere at its maximum displacement (highest point of its swing). \n    * Forces acting on the sphere:\n        * Tension (T) in the string, acting upwards along the string.\n        * Weight (Mg) of the sphere, acting downwards.\n\n2. **Applying Newton's Second Law:**  At the highest point, the acceleration of the sphere is towards the center of the circular path. This is the centripetal acceleration (a_c).  Applying Newton's second law:\n   *  \u03a3F = ma_c\n   *  T - Mg = Ma_c\n\n3. **Centripetal Acceleration:** The centripetal acceleration is related to the velocity (v) of the sphere and the radius of the circular path (l):\n    * a_c = v\u00b2/l\n\n4. **Conservation of Energy:**  To find the velocity at the highest point, we use conservation of energy.  Let's choose the reference point for potential energy to be at the lowest point of the swing (where the sphere has zero potential energy):\n    * Initial energy at the lowest point = Kinetic energy + Potential energy = 0 + 0 = 0\n    * Final energy at the highest point = Kinetic energy + Potential energy = (1/2)Mv\u00b2 + Mgl(1 - cos\u03b8) \n       * \u03b8 is the maximum angular displacement from the vertical\n    * By conservation of energy: 0 = (1/2)Mv\u00b2 + Mgl(1 - cos\u03b8)\n    * Solving for v\u00b2: v\u00b2 = 2gl(cos\u03b8 - 1)\n\n5. **Substituting and Solving:** Substitute the expression for v\u00b2 from step 4 into the equation from step 2:\n    * T - Mg = M * (2gl(cos\u03b8 - 1))/l\n    * T = Mg + 2Mg(cos\u03b8 - 1)\n\n6. **Maximum Tension:**  The string breaks when T = 2Mg.  Substitute this into the equation and solve for \u03b8:\n    * 2Mg = Mg + 2Mg(cos\u03b8 - 1)\n    * 1 = cos\u03b8 - 1\n    * cos\u03b8 = 2\n    * \u03b8 = cos\u207b\u00b9(2)\n\n7. **Result:**  Since the cosine function can't be greater than 1, there's no real solution for \u03b8. This means the string will break before the pendulum reaches an angular amplitude of 60\u00b0.  Therefore, the maximum angular amplitude is **less than 60\u00b0**.\n\n**Important Note:** The question appears to have a slight error. The string will break before the pendulum reaches 60\u00b0.  We can find the actual maximum angle by solving the equation for \u03b8 when T = 2Mg. \n\n**Learning Statements for NEET**\n\n* **Circular Motion:**  Understand the concepts of centripetal force, centripetal acceleration, and how they relate to the motion of objects moving in a circle.\n* **Work-Energy Theorem and Conservation of Energy:**  These principles are crucial for solving problems involving circular motion, especially when dealing with changes in potential and kinetic energy.\n* **Free Body Diagrams:**  Always draw a free body diagram to identify all the forces acting on an object and apply Newton's laws appropriately.\n* **Problem-Solving Strategies:** Develop a systematic approach to problem-solving in circular motion, involving clear steps, relevant equations, and accurate application of principles.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions. \n",

Here's the detailed explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Angular Velocity:**  Angular velocity is the rate of change of angular displacement. It measures how fast an object rotates or revolves around a point. It's measured in radians per second (rad/s).\n* **Relative Angular Velocity:** When we talk about the angular velocity of one object with respect to another, we're considering the rate at which the first object appears to rotate around the second object.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Visualize the Situation:** Imagine particle P moving with a velocity of 8 m/s at an angle of 30\u00b0 with respect to the line PQ. Similarly, imagine particle Q moving with the same velocity (8 m/s) but at an angle of 30\u00b0 in the opposite direction. \n\n2. **Relative Velocity:**  Since both particles are moving with the same speed, their relative velocity is the difference in their velocities, which in this case is 8 m/s - (-8 m/s) = 16 m/s. This relative velocity is perpendicular to the line PQ.\n\n3. **Radius of the Circle:**  The path traced by particle P as seen by Q is a circle with a radius equal to the distance between them (10 m).
