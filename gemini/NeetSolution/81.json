Here's why:\n\n**Free Expansion:**\n\n* **Definition:** Free expansion refers to the expansion of a gas into a vacuum.  There is no external pressure opposing the expansion. \n* **Conditions:** The process is carried out in an isolated system, meaning no heat exchange (Q = 0) and no work done by or on the system (W = 0).\n\n**Ideal Gas Assumptions:**\n\n* **Internal energy only depends on temperature:** For an ideal gas, internal energy (U) is a function of temperature only. \n* **No intermolecular interactions:** Ideal gas molecules do not interact with each other except during collisions.\n\n**Why Q = 0:**\n\n* The process is adiabatic, meaning no heat exchange occurs between the system and surroundings. This is because the expansion happens in an isolated system, preventing any heat flow.\n\n**Why W = 0:**\n\n* Work is defined as force times displacement. In free expansion, there is no external force acting on the gas. The gas expands into a vacuum, meaning no opposing pressure. Therefore, no work is done. \n\n**Why \u0394U = 0:**\n\n* From the first law of thermodynamics, we have: \n   \u0394U = Q + W \n* Since both Q and W are zero in free expansion,  \u0394U = 0.\n* This means the internal energy of the gas remains constant during free expansion. \n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Identify the process:** Free expansion of an ideal gas.\n2. **Apply the conditions:**  Q = 0 (adiabatic), W = 0 (no external pressure).\n3. **Use the first law of thermodynamics:** \u0394U = Q + W.\n4. **Substitute values:** \u0394U = 0 + 0 = 0.\n5. **Conclusion:** \u0394U = 0, meaning the internal energy of the ideal gas remains constant.\n\n**Relevant Formulas:**\n\n* **First Law of Thermodynamics:** \u0394U = Q + W\n* **Internal Energy of an ideal gas:** U = f/2 * nRT  (where f is the degrees of freedom, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature).\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:**\n\n* **Understanding the First Law of Thermodynamics:**  The First Law is fundamental for understanding energy transformations in thermodynamic systems. \n* **Ideal Gas Assumptions:** Be familiar with the properties of ideal gases and how they differ from real gases. \n* **Types of Thermodynamic Processes:** Understand the difference between adiabatic, isothermal, isobaric, and isochoric processes. \n* **Work done by a gas:**  Understand how work is done by a gas during expansion or compression. \n* **Internal Energy:** Know the factors affecting internal energy and how it relates to temperature and other thermodynamic parameters.\n\n**Practice more problems involving different thermodynamic processes and the First Law of Thermodynamics to strengthen your understanding.** \n",

This results in a higher value of (1 - (T\u2082/T\u2081)), leading to higher efficiency.\n* **Lower T\u2082:**  As the temperature of the cold reservoir (T\u2082) decreases, the term (T\u2082/T\u2081) decreases, again leading to a higher value of (1 - (T\u2082/T\u2081)) and increased efficiency.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, for the efficiency of a Carnot engine to be the greatest, the temperature of the hot reservoir (T\u2081) should be high and the temperature of the cold reservoir (T\u2082) should be low.

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts**\n\n* **Ideal Gas:** An ideal gas is a theoretical gas that follows certain ideal gas laws, such as Boyle's Law and Charles' Law. In an ideal gas, the intermolecular forces are negligible, and the particles are point masses.\n* **Expansion:** Expansion refers to the increase in volume of a gas.\n* **Slow vs. Quick Expansion:** The speed of expansion refers to how fast the volume of the gas changes. Slow expansion means the volume change occurs over a longer period, while quick expansion means the volume change occurs over a shorter period.\n* **Pressure:** Pressure is the force exerted per unit area. In a gas, it's a measure of how much the gas molecules are colliding with the walls of the container.\n\n**Why Pressure Change is Greater in Quick Expansion**\n\n* **Work Done by the Gas:** When a gas expands, it does work on its surroundings. The work done is directly proportional to the pressure change and the volume change. \n* **Heat Transfer:**  In a quick expansion, there is less time for heat transfer to occur between the gas and its surroundings. This means the expansion is more **adiabatic** (no heat exchange).\n* **Adiabatic Expansion:** In an adiabatic expansion, the work done by the gas is entirely at the expense of its internal energy. This leads to a greater decrease in internal energy and, consequently, a larger drop in pressure.\n* **Slow Expansion:** In a slow expansion, the gas has more time to exchange heat with its surroundings. This means the expansion is closer to being **isothermal** (constant temperature). In an isothermal expansion, the pressure change is less because the internal energy remains relatively constant.\n\n**Formulas**\n\n* **Adiabatic Process:**  P\u2081V\u2081^\u03b3 = P\u2082V\u2082^\u03b3  (where \u03b3 is the adiabatic index, usually between 1.4 and 1.6)\n* **Isothermal Process:** P\u2081V\u2081 = P\u2082V\u2082 \n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Identify the type of process:** In this case, the quick expansion is closer to adiabatic, while the slow expansion is closer to isothermal.\n2. **Apply the relevant formula:** Use the appropriate formula for each process to calculate the pressure change.\n3. **Compare the results:** You'll find that the pressure change is greater in the adiabatic process (quick expansion) compared to the isothermal process (slow expansion).\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n* Understanding the different types of thermodynamic processes (isothermal, adiabatic, isobaric, isochoric) is crucial. \n* Familiarize yourself with the equations associated with each process.\n* Focus on the relationship between work done, heat transfer, and internal energy changes in different thermodynamic processes.\n* Practice solving problems involving ideal gas expansion and compression. \n* Remember that the concept of adiabatic and isothermal processes is fundamental for understanding how engines, refrigerators, and other thermodynamic systems work. \n",

Mathematically: \n   \u0394U = Q - W\n\n* **State Function:**  Internal energy (U) is a state function, meaning its value depends only on the initial and final states of the system, not the path taken to reach those states. This implies that the change in internal energy (\u0394U) is the same for both processes I and II.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Process I:** We are given Q\u2081 = 100 J and W\u2081 = 80 J. Using the First Law of Thermodynamics, we can find the change in internal energy:\n   \u0394U = Q\u2081 - W\u2081 = 100 J - 80 J = 20 J\n\n2. **Process II:** Since internal energy is a state function, \u0394U is the same for both processes. Therefore, \u0394U = 20 J for process II as well. We are given W\u2082 = 60 J. We can now use the First Law of Thermodynamics to find the heat absorbed (Q\u2082) in process II:\n   Q\u2082 = \u0394U + W\u2082 = 20 J + 60 J = 80 J\n\n**Therefore, the heat absorbed in process II is 80 J.**\n\n## Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:\n\n* **Internal energy is a key concept in thermodynamics:**  Understanding that internal energy is a state function is crucial for solving problems involving different processes.\n* **The First Law of Thermodynamics is fundamental:**  This law forms the basis for many thermodynamic calculations and helps relate heat, work, and internal energy.\n* **Work and heat are path functions:**  Their values depend on the specific process used to reach a state, unlike state functions.\n* **Practice analyzing thermodynamic processes:**  Become comfortable with identifying different types of processes (isothermal, adiabatic, isobaric, isochoric) and applying the First Law of Thermodynamics to calculate relevant quantities.\n\n**Remember:** Understanding the fundamental concepts and applying them to real-world scenarios will help you ace your NEET exam.\n",
