    "4391": "## Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"In rotatory motion, linear velocities of all particles of the body are different\" is **correct**. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Rotatory Motion:**\n\nRotatory motion, also known as rotational motion, is the movement of a rigid body around a fixed axis.  This means that every point on the body moves in a circular path. \n\n**Linear Velocity and Rotational Motion:**\n\n* **Linear Velocity (v):** This is the rate of change of an object's position in a straight line. It has both magnitude (speed) and direction.\n* **Angular Velocity (\u03c9):** In rotational motion, we use angular velocity to describe the rate of change of the angle of rotation. It is measured in radians per second (rad/s). \n\n**Key Relationship:**\n\nThe linear velocity of a particle in a rotating body is directly proportional to its distance from the axis of rotation. This relationship is given by:\n\n**v = r\u03c9**\n\nWhere:\n\n* v = linear velocity of the particle\n* r = distance of the particle from the axis of rotation\n* \u03c9 = angular velocity of the body\n\n**Why Linear Velocities Differ:**\n\nSince different particles in a rotating body are located at different distances from the axis of rotation (r), their linear velocities (v) will be different, even if they share the same angular velocity (\u03c9).\n\n**Example:**\n\nConsider a rotating fan blade. The tip of the blade is further from the axis of rotation than the base of the blade. The tip has a higher linear velocity than the base, even though both points rotate with the same angular velocity.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n* Understand the difference between linear velocity and angular velocity.\n* Know the relationship between linear velocity, angular velocity, and radius of rotation.\n* Be able to apply this relationship to solve problems involving rotating bodies.\n* Remember that in rotational motion, all particles have the same angular velocity, but their linear velocities are different.\n\nBy understanding these concepts, you will be well-prepared to tackle questions about rotational motion in the NEET exam. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Center of Mass:**\n\nThe center of mass (COM) of a body is a point that represents the average position of all the mass within the body. It's like the \"balancing point\" of the object.\n\n**Factors Influencing COM Location:**\n\n* **Shape and Mass Distribution:** The location of the COM is primarily determined by the shape of the object and how its mass is distributed. For symmetrical objects with uniform density, the COM will lie at the geometric center.\n* **Irregular Shapes and Non-Uniform Density:** However, for irregular shapes or objects with non-uniform density, the COM can be located anywhere, including outside the body.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n1. **Solid Sphere:** The COM of a solid sphere lies at its geometric center, which is also within the sphere.\n\n2. **Hollow Sphere:** The COM of a hollow sphere also lies at its geometric center, which is within the sphere, despite the fact that there is no mass at the center.\n\n3. **Crescent Moon:** The COM of a crescent moon shape lies outside the body.\n\n4. **Doughnut:** The COM of a doughnut lies at the center of the hole, which is outside the body of the doughnut.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe location of the COM is not limited to the interior of the body.

    "4394": "## Why the motion of the center of mass depends on the total external forces:\n\nThe statement \"The motion of the center of mass depends on the total external forces\" is a fundamental concept in physics, particularly in the study of systems of particles and rotational motion. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n**1. Center of Mass:**\n\n- The center of mass (CM) of a system is a point that represents the average position of all the mass in the system. \n- Its position is calculated as a weighted average of the positions of all the individual particles in the system.\n\n**2.  Newton's Second Law for the Center of Mass:**\n\n-  Newton's Second Law, which states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it, also applies to the center of mass of a system.\n-  For a system of particles, the net external force acting on the system is equal to the mass of the system times the acceleration of the center of mass.\n\n**Formula:** \n \n    \u03a3F_ext = M_total * a_CM\n\nWhere:\n- \u03a3F_ext:  Total external force acting on the system\n- M_total: Total mass of the system\n- a_CM: Acceleration of the center of mass\n\n**3.  Explanation:**\n\n- The above formula shows a direct relationship between the total external force acting on a system and the acceleration of its center of mass.\n- If there is no net external force (\u03a3F_ext = 0), the center of mass will remain at rest or continue to move at a constant velocity (Newton's First Law).\n- Conversely, if there is a net external force, the center of mass will accelerate in the direction of that force.\n\n**4.  Example:**\n\n- Imagine pushing a box across a smooth floor. The force you apply is an external force acting on the box. The box accelerates in the direction of your push, and the center of mass of the box moves along with it.\n\n**5.  Internal Forces:**\n\n- Internal forces, such as the forces between particles within the system, do not affect the motion of the center of mass. \n- These forces cancel out in the overall calculation because they act in equal and opposite directions.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:**\n\n**System of Particles and Rotational Motion:**\n\n* **Understanding the concept of center of mass is crucial for analyzing the motion of complex systems.**\n* **Internal forces do not affect the motion of the center of mass, only external forces do.**\n* **The motion of the center of mass is governed by Newton's Laws of Motion, just like any individual particle.**\n* **Be familiar with the formula \u03a3F_ext = M_total * a_CM and its implications.**\n* **Practice solving problems involving the motion of the center of mass, including systems with multiple particles.**\n* **Remember to analyze the forces acting on a system carefully to determine the net external force affecting its motion.**\n* **Consider the conservation of linear momentum in relation to the motion of the center of mass.** \n* **Learn about different types of rotational motion and how to calculate angular momentum and torque.**\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing, you can excel in the \"System of Particles and Rotational Motion\" section of the NEET exam. \n",

It's a linear combination of the position vectors r\u2081 and r\u2082, which means R_COM will always be a point lying on the line joining r\u2081 and r\u2082.  \n\n**In simpler terms:** \n\nThink of a seesaw. If you place two objects of different masses on the seesaw, the balance point (the COM) will be closer to the heavier object.  The COM is always along the line connecting the two objects, even if they have different masses.\n\n## Learning Statements for NEET Exam:\n\nHere are some key takeaways from this concept:\n\n* **Center of Mass is a Fundamental Concept:** Understanding the centre of mass is crucial for understanding the motion of rigid bodies and systems of particles.\n* **Importance of Mass Distribution:** The position of the COM depends on the distribution of masses in the system.\n* **Equilibrium and Stability:** The COM plays a key role in determining the equilibrium and stability of a system.\n* **Rotational Motion:** The concept of COM is essential for understanding rotational motion, including moments of inertia and angular momentum.\n\nBy focusing on these key points, you'll be well-prepared for the NEET exam regarding System of Particles and Rotational Motion. \n",

This means there is no linear acceleration.\n3. **Net torque is non-zero:** However, the forces create a **torque** due to their separation. \n4. **Torque causes rotation:** The net torque on the body causes it to rotate about the axis of rotation.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine opening a door.  You apply a force on the door handle (one force), and the door hinge provides an equal and opposite force (the other force).  These two forces constitute a couple.  The torque generated by this couple causes the door to rotate on its hinges.\n\n**Learning Statements:**\n\n* **Understanding Torque:** A couple is a key concept in rotational motion because it directly generates torque, which is the driving force behind rotation.\n* **Net Force vs. Net Torque:** Remember that a couple produces zero net force but non-zero net torque, leading to rotational motion without linear acceleration.\n* **Types of Rotational Motion:**  Different types of rotational motion (uniform, non-uniform, etc.) arise from different torque configurations and their application. \n* **Rotational Inertia:**  The tendency of a body to resist changes in its rotational motion is measured by its rotational inertia, which depends on the mass distribution of the body.\n* **Angular Momentum:** Rotational motion is also characterized by angular momentum, which is a measure of the body's mass and velocity in rotation.\n\n**Note:** The NEET exam often tests the ability to apply these concepts to different scenarios involving rigid bodies and rotational motion. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Moment of Inertia**\n\nMoment of inertia (I) is a measure of an object's resistance to rotational motion. It depends on the object's mass distribution and the axis of rotation.  The further the mass is distributed from the axis of rotation, the greater the moment of inertia.\n\n**The Difference Between Raw and Half-Boiled Eggs**\n\n* **Raw Egg:** The yolk and white are liquid and distributed throughout the egg. This means the mass is spread out further from the central axis. \n* **Half-Boiled Egg:** The yolk becomes solid, and the white partially solidifies. This concentrates the mass closer to the central axis.\n\n**Why Raw Egg Has Greater Moment of Inertia**\n\nSince the mass in a raw egg is distributed further from the central axis compared to a half-boiled egg, the raw egg will have a greater moment of inertia. This is because the more distant mass contributes more significantly to the moment of inertia.\n\n**Formulas**\n\nWhile the exact calculation of moment of inertia for an egg is complex, the general formula is:\n\nI = \u2211 mi * ri\u00b2 \n\nwhere:\n\n* I is the moment of inertia\n* mi is the mass of the ith particle\n* ri is the distance of the ith particle from the axis of rotation\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam**\n\n* **Moment of Inertia is crucial for rotational motion:** Just like mass influences linear motion, moment of inertia governs rotational motion. Understanding it is key to analyzing objects moving in a circular path.\n* **Mass distribution impacts moment of inertia:** The distribution of mass within an object significantly affects its moment of inertia. This concept applies to various scenarios, like understanding the stability of spinning objects.\n* **Moment of inertia is not just about mass:** It also depends on the axis of rotation. The same object can have different moment of inertia depending on where it's rotating around.\n\n**Important Note:** This is a simplified explanation, and the actual moment of inertia of an egg would involve complex calculations and the shape of the egg.

This means \u03b8 = 36 * 2\u03c0 radians (one rotation is 2\u03c0 radians).\n\n3. **Solving for Angular Acceleration:**\n    * Substitute the known values into the equation:\n    (\u03c9\u2080/2)\u00b2 = \u03c9\u2080\u00b2 + 2\u03b1(36 * 2\u03c0)\n    * Simplifying the equation:\n    \u03c9\u2080\u00b2/4 - \u03c9\u2080\u00b2 = 144\u03b1\u03c0\n    * Solving for \u03b1:\n    \u03b1 = -\u03c9\u2080\u00b2 / (576\u03c0)\n\n4. **Finding Rotations to Rest:**\n    * Now, we need to find the angular displacement (\u03b8\u2081) the fan makes while coming to rest from its current velocity (\u03c9\u2080/2). Since the fan comes to rest, \u03c9 = 0.\n    * Using the same equation of motion:\n    0\u00b2 = (\u03c9\u2080/2)\u00b2 + 2\u03b1\u03b8\u2081\n    * Substituting the value of \u03b1:\n    0\u00b2 = (\u03c9\u2080/2)\u00b2 + 2 * (-\u03c9\u2080\u00b2 / (576\u03c0))\u03b8\u2081\n    * Solving for \u03b8\u2081:\n    \u03b8\u2081 = 144\u03c0 radians \n\n5. **Converting to Rotations:**\n    * \u03b8\u2081 = 144\u03c0 radians corresponds to \u03b8\u2081 / 2\u03c0 = 72 rotations.\n\n6. **Final Answer:** The fan makes a total of 72 rotations after its velocity halves.  Since it already made 36 rotations, it will make **72 - 36 = 12** more rotations before coming to rest. \n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:**\n\n* Understand the concepts of angular velocity, angular acceleration, and uniform angular acceleration.\n* Be familiar with the equations of motion for rotational motion with constant angular acceleration.\n* Learn how to relate angular displacement and angular velocity using these equations.\n* Practice solving problems involving the dynamics of rotating bodies.\n\nRemember, understanding the concepts and applying them to various scenarios is key to success in NEET. \n",
    "4425": "## Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"the angular momentum is conserved about the point of contact only\" is **correct** in the scenario described. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Scenario**\n\n* **Linear Velocity:** When a disc is given a linear velocity on a rough surface, it means the disc is moving in a straight line.\n* **Rough Surface:** The rough surface introduces friction, which acts as a torque on the disc. This torque opposes the disc's motion, causing it to slow down.\n* **Angular Momentum:** Angular momentum is a measure of an object's tendency to rotate. It depends on the object's mass, velocity, and distance from the axis of rotation.\n\n**Why Angular Momentum is Conserved about the Point of Contact**\n\n1. **No External Torque:** Since the frictional force acts at the point of contact, the net torque acting on the disc **about the point of contact** is zero. This is because the lever arm of the frictional force with respect to the point of contact is zero.\n2. **Conservation of Angular Momentum:**  A fundamental principle in physics states that angular momentum remains constant in the absence of external torque. Since the torque about the point of contact is zero, the angular momentum of the disc **about that point** remains conserved.\n\n**Why Angular Momentum is Not Conserved about other Points**\n\n* **Torque about other Points:**  The frictional force does exert a torque about any point other than the point of contact. This is because the lever arm of the frictional force is non-zero with respect to those points.\n* **Change in Angular Momentum:**  Since there's a net torque about these points, the angular momentum of the disc about those points will change over time.\n\n**Formulas:**\n\n* **Angular Momentum (L):**  L = I\u03c9, where I is the moment of inertia and \u03c9 is the angular velocity.\n* **Torque (\u03c4):**  \u03c4 = r x F, where r is the lever arm and F is the force.\n\n**Learning Statements:**\n\n* **Angular momentum is a conserved quantity in the absence of external torque.** This is a fundamental principle in rotational motion.\n* **The point about which angular momentum is conserved is crucial.**  Different points can experience different torques, leading to different conservation behaviors.\n* **Friction can act as a torque.**  Understanding the relationship between friction, torque, and angular momentum is vital in solving problems involving rotational motion. \n* **Understanding the concept of lever arm is important in determining torque.** The lever arm is the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the line of action of the force.\n\nBy applying these concepts and practicing relevant problems, you can build a solid foundation in System of Particles and Rotational Motion, a crucial topic for NEET preparation.\n"
