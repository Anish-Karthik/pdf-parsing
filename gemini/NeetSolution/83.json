This means its scale is not calibrated correctly. We need to find the corresponding temperature on the faulty scale for a given Celsius temperature.\n\n**Solution**\n\n1. **Find the difference in the fixed points:**\n   - The faulty thermometer's freezing point is -5\u00b0 compared to 0\u00b0 on the Celsius scale, a difference of 5\u00b0.\n   - The faulty thermometer's boiling point is 95\u00b0 compared to 100\u00b0 on the Celsius scale, a difference of 5\u00b0.\n\n2. **Calculate the scale factor:**\n   - The faulty thermometer has a range of 100\u00b0 (95\u00b0 - (-5\u00b0)) compared to the Celsius scale's range of 100\u00b0 (100\u00b0 - 0\u00b0).\n   - Therefore, the scale factor is 1:1. This means every degree on the faulty thermometer is equivalent to one degree on the Celsius scale.\n\n3. **Convert the Celsius temperature to the faulty scale:**\n   - The Celsius temperature is 55\u00b0.\n   - Since the scale factor is 1:1, the corresponding temperature on the faulty thermometer is also **55\u00b0**.\n\n**Why the answer is 50 is incorrect**\n\nThe answer provided (50\u00b0) is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that the faulty thermometer has its zero point shifted. While the scale factor is 1:1, the offset of 5\u00b0 needs to be considered.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation**\n\n* **Temperature Scales:** Familiarize yourself with different temperature scales (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin) and how to convert between them.\n* **Thermal Expansion:** Understand the concept of thermal expansion and how different materials expand or contract at different rates.\n* **Specific Heat Capacity:**  Know the definition of specific heat capacity and its importance in calculating heat transfer.\n* **Heat Transfer:** Learn the different modes of heat transfer (conduction, convection, radiation) and their characteristics.\n* **Calorimetry:** Be able to apply the principles of calorimetry to solve problems involving heat transfer and temperature changes.\n\n**Key Formula for Thermal Properties of Matter**\n\n* **Heat Transfer:** Q = mc\u0394T \n    - Q = Heat transferred\n    - m = Mass of the substance\n    - c = Specific heat capacity\n    - \u0394T = Change in temperature \n\n**Practice Problems:**\n\nTo solidify your understanding, try solving similar problems with different fixed points on the faulty thermometer and different Celsius temperatures.

Let's represent the initial length as 'L' and the change in length as '\u0394L'. We can express this as:\n    * \u0394L = 0.03L\n\n2. **Area Expansion:** The area of the base of the cylinder is given by:\n    * A = \u03c0r\u00b2 (where 'r' is the radius)\n\n    Since the cylinder is uniform, the radius also increases proportionally to the length.

    "4437": "##  Explanation of the Answer and Relevant Concepts\n\nThe answer provided, **39.2\u00b0F**, is **incorrect**. The maximum density of water occurs at **4\u00b0C (39.2\u00b0F)**, not -39.2\u00b0F. This is a crucial concept in understanding the behavior of water and its unique properties.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n**1. Density and Temperature Relationship:**\n\n* Generally, as the temperature of a substance increases, its density decreases. This is because the molecules gain kinetic energy and move further apart, increasing the volume while the mass remains constant.\n* However, water exhibits an unusual behavior due to its hydrogen bonding.\n\n**2. Hydrogen Bonding in Water:**\n\n* Water molecules form strong hydrogen bonds with each other. These bonds create a network of interconnected molecules, influencing its physical properties.\n* At temperatures below 4\u00b0C, the hydrogen bonds dominate, causing the water molecules to arrange in a more open structure, leading to a lower density.\n\n**3. Maximum Density at 4\u00b0C:**\n\n* As water cools from room temperature to 4\u00b0C, the hydrogen bonding strengthens, causing the molecules to pack closer together, resulting in maximum density.\n* Below 4\u00b0C, the open structure formed by hydrogen bonding becomes more pronounced, causing the density to decrease again.\n\n**4. Why -39.2\u00b0F is incorrect:**\n\n* -39.2\u00b0F is the freezing point of water. At this temperature, water transitions from a liquid state to a solid state (ice). The density of ice is lower than that of liquid water, which is why ice floats.\n\n**Relevant Formulas:**\n\nWhile this question doesn't require specific formulas, understanding the concept of density is important:\n\n* **Density (\u03c1) = Mass (m) / Volume (V)**\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:**\n\n1. **Water's Unique Behavior:** Understand that water's density behavior is different from most other substances.  It reaches its maximum density at 4\u00b0C, and this unique property has significant implications for life on Earth.\n2. **Hydrogen Bonding:**  Be familiar with hydrogen bonding, its effect on water's properties, and how it influences the structure and behavior of water molecules.\n3. **Density and Temperature:**  Relate the concepts of density and temperature. Understand that temperature changes can influence density, but water's behavior due to hydrogen bonding is exceptional.\n4. **Freezing Point:** Remember the freezing point of water (0\u00b0C or 32\u00b0F) and the associated density changes during the transition from liquid to solid.\n5. **Thermal Properties of Matter:**  This question belongs to the broader topic of \"Thermal Properties of Matter\" and its relation to the physical properties of substances.  Be prepared to analyze the behavior of matter under different temperature conditions.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and their implications, you will be well-equipped to answer similar questions in the NEET exam. \n",

Its solid form (ice) is less dense than its liquid form. This is because the hydrogen bonds in ice create a very open, crystalline structure.\n* **Pressure and Melting Point:** When pressure is applied to ice, the molecules are forced closer together, effectively \"compressing\" the open structure. This reduces the volume occupied by ice and increases its density.\n* **Phase Equilibrium:** For ice to melt, it needs to absorb enough heat to overcome the intermolecular forces holding its structure together. At normal pressure, this occurs at 0\u00b0C.  However, when pressure increases, the ice structure is already partially compressed, requiring less energy to break the bonds. \n* **Le Chatelier's Principle:** This principle states that a system at equilibrium will shift in a direction that relieves the stress applied. In the case of ice, increasing pressure favors the denser liquid phase, which is why the melting point decreases. \n\n**Step-by-step approach:**\n\n1. **Understand the unique properties of water:** Water's solid form (ice) is less dense than its liquid form.\n2. **Consider the effect of pressure:**  Pressure applied to ice forces its molecules closer together, reducing its volume and increasing its density.\n3. **Relate pressure to melting point:** The increased density of compressed ice requires less energy to break its structure, effectively lowering its melting point.\n4. **Apply Le Chatelier's principle:** The system shifts towards the denser liquid phase to relieve the pressure stress.\n\n**Relevant Formulas:**\n\n* **Clausius-Clapeyron Equation:** This equation relates the change in vapor pressure of a substance with temperature and enthalpy of vaporization. While it's not directly applied here, it is important for understanding phase transitions.\n* **Density Formula:** Density = Mass/Volume.

Conversely, when water is cooled below 4\u00b0C, its density also decreases and its volume increases.\n* **Overflowing:**  Since the beaker is already filled to the brim, any increase in the volume of water, either due to heating above 4\u00b0C or cooling below 4\u00b0C, will result in the water overflowing. \n\n**Step-by-step approach:**\n\n1. **Understand the concept of thermal expansion:** Thermal expansion refers to the change in volume of a substance due to changes in temperature.\n2. **Identify the anomalous behavior of water:** Water expands when heated above 4\u00b0C and also when cooled below 4\u00b0C. \n3. **Apply the concept to the scenario:** Since the beaker is full, any change in volume (due to expansion) will cause the water to overflow.\n\n**Relevant formulas:**\n\n* **Volume expansion coefficient (\u03b2):** This represents the fractional change in volume per degree Celsius change in temperature.\n* **\u0394V = V\u2080\u03b2\u0394T:**  where \u0394V is the change in volume, V\u2080 is the initial volume, \u03b2 is the volume expansion coefficient, and \u0394T is the change in temperature.\n\n**Learning statements for NEET exam:**\n\n1. **Anomalous behavior of water:** Understanding the unique expansion behavior of water is crucial for solving problems related to its density, volume, and other properties.\n2. **Thermal expansion:**  Be familiar with the concepts of linear, areal, and volume expansion, and their respective coefficients.\n3. **Applications of thermal expansion:**  Learn how thermal expansion is used in various applications, such as thermometers, bimetallic strips, and bridges.\n4. **Density and its relation to volume and temperature:**  Understand how density changes with temperature, especially in the case of water.\n5. **Real-life examples:**  Think about practical scenarios where thermal expansion plays a significant role, like the expansion of railway tracks in summer or the expansion of metal pipes in winter. \n\nBy mastering these concepts, you'll be better prepared for NEET exam questions related to thermal properties of matter. \n",
    "4448": "## Explanation:\n\nThe answer is **Volume** because of the relationship between temperature, volume, and the three dimensions of a solid object. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n**1. Thermal Expansion:**\n\nWhen a substance is heated, its particles gain kinetic energy and vibrate more vigorously. This increased vibration causes the average distance between particles to increase, leading to an expansion in size. This phenomenon is called **thermal expansion**.\n\n**2.

While most substances contract in volume as they cool down, water expands slightly when cooled from 4\u00b0C to 0\u00b0C. \n\n**The Explanation:**\n\n* **Hydrogen Bonding:** Water molecules form strong hydrogen bonds with each other. These bonds are responsible for many of water's unique properties, including its high boiling point and surface tension.\n* **Structure at Different Temperatures:**\n    * **Above 4\u00b0C:** As water warms, the molecules move faster, breaking some hydrogen bonds and increasing the distance between them. This leads to an increase in volume and a decrease in density.\n    * **Below 4\u00b0C:** As water cools further below 4\u00b0C, the hydrogen bonds become more stable and ordered. This ordered structure creates a more open arrangement of water molecules, leading to a slight expansion in volume and a decrease in density.\n* **Maximum Density:** At 4\u00b0C, the balance between thermal motion and hydrogen bonding results in the most compact arrangement of water molecules, leading to its maximum density. \n\n**Learning Statements for NEET:**\n\n* **Thermal Properties of Matter:** This topic is crucial for understanding the behavior of matter under different temperature conditions.

    "4452": "## Explanation:\n\nThe answer is correct because water exhibits an anomalous expansion behaviour. Here's why:\n\n* **Normal Expansion:** Most substances, including water, expand when heated and contract when cooled. This is because the molecules gain kinetic energy upon heating and move further apart, leading to increased volume. \n* **Anomalous Expansion of Water:**  However, water behaves unusually between 0\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C. In this temperature range, water contracts upon heating and expands upon cooling. This is due to the unique structure of water molecules and the way they form hydrogen bonds.\n* **The Phenomenon:**  At 4\u00b0C, water reaches its maximum density.  As the temperature drops below 4\u00b0C, water starts expanding because the hydrogen bonds become more dominant, forcing the molecules further apart despite the decrease in kinetic energy.\n\n**Therefore, a beaker completely filled with water at 4\u00b0C will overflow:**\n\n* **When heated:** As the temperature rises above 4\u00b0C, the water will expand normally and overflow.\n* **When cooled:**  As the temperature drops below 4\u00b0C, the water will expand due to its anomalous behavior and overflow.\n\n##  Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Special Case:** Recognize that the question involves water at 4\u00b0C, the temperature where it has its maximum density.\n2. **Understand Anomalous Expansion:** Recall the concept of anomalous expansion of water between 0\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C.\n3. **Apply the Concept:**  Since water expands when cooled below 4\u00b0C and expands when heated above 4\u00b0C, it will overflow in both cases.\n\n## Relevant Formula:\n\nWhile this question doesn't involve specific calculations, the formula for density is relevant to understand the concept:\n\n**Density (\u03c1) = Mass (m) / Volume (V)**\n\nThe anomalous expansion of water is related to the density changes as temperature varies.\n\n## Learning Statements for NEET:\n\n* **Master the concept of thermal expansion and its different types:** This includes linear, area, and volume expansion.\n* **Understand the anomalous expansion of water:**  Learn the temperature range where it occurs and its implications.\n* **Know the factors affecting thermal expansion:** These include the nature of the material, temperature change, and initial volume.\n* **Be able to solve problems involving thermal expansion:** Practice using the relevant formulas and applying the concepts to various scenarios.\n\nRemember that these learning statements are general guidelines.

While it might affect the overall weight of the strip, it doesn't impact the relative expansion and contraction of the metals.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Identify the principle:** Thermostats work based on the differential expansion of materials.\n2. **Recall the relevant property:** The property that governs the expansion and contraction of materials with temperature change is the coefficient of linear expansion.\n3. **Understand the bimetallic strip:** The bimetallic strip is designed to utilize the difference in expansion between two metals with different coefficients of linear expansion.\n\n**Relevant Formulas:**\n\n* **Linear Expansion:** \u0394L = \u03b1L\u0394T \n   * \u0394L = change in length\n   * \u03b1 = coefficient of linear expansion\n   * L = original length\n   * \u0394T = change in temperature\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n* **Thermal Properties of Matter:** This topic is crucial for understanding how materials behave under varying temperatures.\n* **Coefficient of Linear Expansion:**  This property is key for understanding the expansion and contraction of solids. Be able to calculate the change in length using the formula above.\n* **Applications of Thermal Expansion:**  Learn about real-world applications of thermal expansion, such as bimetallic strips in thermostats, bridges, and railway tracks.\n* **Thermal Stress:** Understand how differences in expansion can create stress in materials, potentially leading to cracking or deformation.\n\nBy understanding these concepts, you will be well-prepared to tackle NEET questions related to thermal properties of matter. \n",
    "4458": "## Explanation of the Answer\n\nThe statement \"Thermal expansion of a solid is because of an asymmetric potential energy curve\" is **correct**. Here's why:\n\n**1. Potential Energy and Atomic Vibrations:**\n\n*  Atoms in a solid are not stationary. They vibrate about their mean positions due to thermal energy. \n*  The potential energy of an atom in a solid is represented by a potential energy curve, which describes the interaction between the atom and its neighbors.\n* **Asymmetric Potential Energy Curve:**  A perfectly symmetric potential energy curve would mean that the atom experiences the same force pulling it back towards its equilibrium position regardless of the direction of its displacement. This is not the case in real solids. \n\n**2. Asymmetric Curve and Expansion:**\n\n* **Unequal Forces:**  An asymmetric potential energy curve indicates that the restoring force experienced by the atom is stronger when it is displaced in one direction than the other. This means the atom will spend more time on the side of the curve with the stronger force.\n* **Increased Spacing:** As the temperature increases, the atoms vibrate with greater amplitude. Since the potential energy curve is asymmetric, the average distance between the atoms (and hence the solid's size) increases more on the side with the weaker restoring force. This leads to thermal expansion.\n\n**3. Visualization:**\n\nImagine a spring with unequal spring constants. When stretched, it will be harder to pull it further on one side than the other. Similarly, the asymmetric potential energy curve of a solid creates a situation where the average distance between atoms is greater when they vibrate more vigorously.\n\n**Key Formula for Understanding Thermal Expansion:**\n\n* **Linear Thermal Expansion:** \u0394L = \u03b1L\u2080\u0394T\n   * \u0394L: Change in length\n   * \u03b1: Coefficient of linear thermal expansion (material-specific)\n   * L\u2080: Original length\n   * \u0394T: Change in temperature\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:**\n\n* **Understanding the concept of thermal expansion:** Thermal expansion is a crucial concept in understanding the behavior of materials under changing temperatures.\n* **Connecting thermal expansion to potential energy:** The asymmetry of the potential energy curve is the fundamental reason behind thermal expansion.\n* **Learning about the coefficient of thermal expansion:** Each material has its unique coefficient of thermal expansion.\n* **Applying the formula for thermal expansion:** Practice using the formula to calculate changes in length, volume, or area due to temperature changes.\n\n**Important Note:** While the asymmetric potential energy curve is a fundamental explanation, other factors like intermolecular forces and lattice structure also play a role in thermal expansion.\n",
    "4459": "The answer provided is **incorrect**. The time period of a pendulum does **not** increase with increasing temperature. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Time Period of a Pendulum**\n\nThe time period (T) of a simple pendulum, the time taken for one complete oscillation, is determined by:\n\n* **Length of the pendulum (L):**  The longer the pendulum, the longer the time period.\n* **Acceleration due to gravity (g):** The stronger the gravitational force, the shorter the time period.\n\nThe formula for the time period is:\n\n```\nT = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g) \n```\n\n**Impact of Temperature on Pendulum Length**\n\nWhen the temperature increases, the length of the pendulum **does** increase due to thermal expansion. This expansion is usually a very small change, but it does affect the time period.\n\n**Why the Answer is Incorrect**\n\nThe answer states that the time period increases because the length increases. While this is true, it misses a crucial point:\n\n* **The center of mass of the bob remains at the center of the bob.** This means that the effective length of the pendulum, the distance from the pivot point to the center of mass, remains **approximately** the same.\n\n**Corrected Explanation**\n\n* **Increase in length:**  The pendulum's length increases due to thermal expansion.\n* **Negligible change in effective length:** The expansion is usually small enough that the change in the distance from the pivot point to the center of mass is negligible.\n* **Negligible change in time period:** Since the effective length remains almost constant, the time period of the pendulum remains nearly the same, even though the overall length has increased.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam**\n\n* **Thermal Expansion:** Understand the concept of linear, areal, and volumetric thermal expansion of solids, liquids, and gases. Be able to calculate the change in length, area, or volume due to temperature changes.\n* **Pendulums:** Know the factors that influence the time period of a pendulum and be able to apply the formula.\n* **Real-world Applications:** Consider the effects of temperature changes on real-world objects and systems, like bridges, buildings, and clocks. \n* **Neglecting Minor Effects:**  In many physics problems, especially those involving pendulums, we often neglect small changes in length due to temperature variations. Understand when these approximations are valid and when they might lead to significant errors. \n",
    "4460": "##  Explanation:\n\nThe answer \"It has high specific heat\" is correct. Here's why:\n\n**Specific Heat Capacity:**\n\n* **Definition:**  Specific heat capacity (c) is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of a substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 Kelvin). \n* **Formula:**  Q = mc\u0394T, where:\n    * Q = Heat energy transferred\n    * m = Mass of the substance\n    * c = Specific heat capacity of the substance\n    * \u0394T = Change in temperature \n\n**Why Water is a Good Coolant and Heater:**\n\n* **High Specific Heat Capacity:**  Water has a very high specific heat capacity compared to many other substances. This means it can absorb a large amount of heat energy without a significant increase in its own temperature. \n* **Coolant:** In automobile radiators, water absorbs heat from the engine, preventing it from overheating.  Since water has a high specific heat, it can absorb a large amount of heat energy without reaching a dangerous temperature.  The water is then circulated through the radiator, where the heat is dissipated into the air.\n* **Heater:** In hot water bags, water absorbs heat from a source (e.g., boiling water) and retains it due to its high specific heat.  This allows the hot water bag to provide warmth for a longer duration.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nWater's high specific heat capacity makes it an excellent choice for both cooling and heating applications. It can absorb or release large amounts of heat energy with minimal temperature changes, making it effective at regulating temperature.\n\n## Learning Statements for NEET Exam:\n\n* **Understand the definition and formula for specific heat capacity.**\n* **Recognize the significance of high specific heat capacity for substances used in cooling and heating applications.**\n* **Be able to explain why water is a good coolant and heater based on its high specific heat capacity.**\n* **Understand the role of specific heat capacity in heat transfer processes.**\n* **Study other thermal properties of matter, such as thermal conductivity and latent heat, to understand their applications in different situations.**\n\n**Note:** These learning statements are a starting point. You should explore the topic of thermal properties of matter in more depth using your NEET study materials and practice solving various problems. \n"
