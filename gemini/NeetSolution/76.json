    "4238": "## Explanation:\n\nThe ionization potential of an atom is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from its outermost shell. The second ionization potential refers to the energy required to remove the second electron from the atom, after the first electron has already been removed.\n\n**For Helium (He):**\n\n* Helium has an atomic number of 2, meaning it has 2 electrons in its electronic configuration: 1s\u00b2. \n* The first ionization potential of Helium is the energy required to remove one electron from the 1s orbital, leaving behind a He\u207a ion.\n* The second ionization potential is the energy required to remove the second electron from the He\u207a ion to form a He\u00b2\u207a ion. This electron is also in the 1s orbital.\n\n**Why 54.4 V is correct:**\n\nThe second ionization potential of Helium is significantly higher than the first ionization potential. This is because:\n\n1. **Nuclear Charge:** After removing one electron, the He\u207a ion has a greater nuclear charge (+2) compared to the neutral Helium atom (+1). This stronger attraction makes it harder to remove the second electron.\n2. **Electron-Electron Repulsion:** In neutral Helium, the two electrons in the 1s orbital experience some repulsion. When one electron is removed, this repulsion is eliminated, making the remaining electron more tightly bound to the nucleus.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThe ionization potential can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n**Ionization Potential (IP) = 13.6 * Z\u00b2/n\u00b2  eV**\n\nWhere:\n\n* Z = Atomic number\n* n = Principal quantum number of the electron shell\n\nFor the second ionization of Helium:\n\n* Z = 2 (atomic number of Helium)\n* n = 1 (since the remaining electron is in the 1s orbital)\n\nTherefore, the second ionization potential of Helium is:\n\n**IP = 13.6 * 2\u00b2/1\u00b2 = 54.4 eV**\n\n**Converting to Volts:**\n\n1 eV = 1.602 * 10\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J \n1 J = 1 V * C\n\nTherefore, 54.4 eV = 54.4 * 1.602 * 10\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J = 54.4 * 1.602 * 10\u207b\u00b9\u2079 V * C = **54.4 V**\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n* **Electronic Configuration:** Understand how to write the electronic configuration of an element and how it affects its ionization potential.\n* **Nuclear Charge:** Understand how the nuclear charge influences the attraction between the nucleus and electrons.\n* **Electron-Electron Repulsion:** Understand how electron-electron repulsion affects the energy required to remove an electron.\n* **Ionization Potential Trends:**  Be familiar with the trends in ionization potential across a period and down a group in the periodic table.\n* **Applications of Ionization Potential:** Understand how ionization potential is related to other properties of atoms and molecules. \n",

    "4240": "## Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of the relationship between atomic structure, energy levels, and spectral lines. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n**1. Understanding the Relationship**\n\n* **Spectral Lines:** When an electron in an atom transitions between energy levels, it emits or absorbs photons of specific wavelengths. These wavelengths correspond to the spectral lines observed in an atom's emission or absorption spectrum.\n* **Energy Levels:** The energy levels of an electron in an atom are quantized, meaning they can only take on specific discrete values. These values are determined by the atom's atomic number and its electron configuration.\n* **Hydrogen Atom:** The hydrogen atom, with only one proton and one electron, has a relatively simple energy level structure. Its spectral lines are well-defined and have been extensively studied.\n\n**2. Applying the Information**\n\n* **The Question:** The question states that an ionic atom has a wavelength equal to 1/4 of the wavelengths of hydrogen lines. This implies that the energy levels of this ionic atom are significantly different from those of the hydrogen atom.\n* **Relationship between Wavelength and Energy:** The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength (E = hc/\u03bb, where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and \u03bb is wavelength). Therefore, a shorter wavelength corresponds to higher energy. \n* **Energy Level Differences:** Since the ionic atom has shorter wavelengths (higher energy), the energy differences between its energy levels must be larger than those in the hydrogen atom.\n\n**3. Identifying the Ion**\n\n* **He\u207a:** The ion He\u207a (helium ion) has lost one electron, leaving it with one proton and one electron, similar to hydrogen. However, the presence of two protons in the nucleus creates a stronger electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the electron, leading to more tightly bound energy levels. This results in larger energy differences and shorter wavelengths in the He\u207a spectrum.\n* **Why Not Other Ions:** Other ions like Li\u00b2\u207a or Be\u00b3\u207a would have even stronger nuclear attraction, leading to even shorter wavelengths than He\u207a. The question specifies that the wavelength is 1/4 of the hydrogen lines, which points to a specific energy level difference, making He\u207a the most likely answer.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Approach**\n\n1. **Analyze the Question:** The question states that the wavelength of the ionic atom is 1/4th of the hydrogen lines.\n2. **Understand Wavelength-Energy Relationship:**  Remember that shorter wavelengths imply higher energies.\n3. **Consider Energy Level Differences:**  The ionic atom's higher energies suggest larger energy level differences.\n4. **Identify the Ion:** Look for an ion with a similar structure to hydrogen but a stronger nuclear attraction. He\u207a fits this description.\n\n**5.

    "4242": "## Explanation of the Answer\n\nThe question asks for the transition in a hydrogen atom that emits a photon with the lowest frequency. Here's why the answer is **n=4 to n=3**:\n\n**1. Energy Levels and Transitions:**\n\n* In a hydrogen atom, electrons occupy specific energy levels, denoted by the principal quantum number (n). Higher values of n correspond to higher energy levels.\n* When an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, it releases energy in the form of a photon.\n\n**2.
