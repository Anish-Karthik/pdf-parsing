Understanding the Motion:**\n\n* **Balloon:** The balloon is accelerating upwards with 1.25 m/s\u00b2. This means its velocity is increasing every second.\n* **Stone:** When the stone is released, it inherits the upward velocity of the balloon at that moment. However, it's then subjected to gravity, pulling it downwards with an acceleration of 10 m/s\u00b2.\n\n**2. Calculating Initial Velocity of the Stone:**\n\n* **Balloon's Velocity:**  Using the equation v = u + at, where:\n    * v = final velocity\n    * u = initial velocity (0 m/s in this case)\n    * a = acceleration (1.25 m/s\u00b2)\n    * t = time (8 seconds)\n    * We get the balloon's velocity after 8 seconds: v = 0 + (1.25 m/s\u00b2)(8 s) = 10 m/s\n* **Stone's Initial Velocity:**  This is the same as the balloon's velocity at the time of release, so the stone's initial upward velocity is 10 m/s.\n\n**3. Analyzing Stone's Motion:**\n\n* **Upward Motion:** The stone initially travels upwards against gravity, slowing down until its upward velocity reaches 0. \n* **Downward Motion:**  Once the stone's upward velocity becomes 0, gravity takes over, and it starts falling downwards, accelerating at 10 m/s\u00b2.\n\n**4. Applying Equations of Motion:**\n\n* **We need to find the time it takes for the stone to reach the ground.** We can use the equation: \n    * s = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2\n    * Where: \n        * s = total displacement (the height the stone is released from)\n        * u = initial velocity (10 m/s upwards)\n        * a = acceleration due to gravity (-10 m/s\u00b2, negative since it's downwards)\n        * t = time (what we need to find)\n\n* **To find 's', the height the stone is released from:**\n    * We use the equation: s = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2\n    * Where:\n        * s = height the balloon reaches after 8 seconds\n        * u = 0 m/s (initial velocity of the balloon)\n        * a = 1.25 m/s\u00b2\n        * t = 8 seconds\n    *  Therefore, s = (0)(8) + (1/2)(1.25)(8)\u00b2 = 40 m\n\n**5.

Ball A's Journey:**\n\n* Ball A is thrown upwards, initially converting its kinetic energy into potential energy as it moves against gravity.\n* At the highest point, its velocity becomes zero, and all its initial kinetic energy is converted to potential energy.\n* As it falls back down, the potential energy is converted back into kinetic energy, gaining speed as it falls.\n* When it reaches the ground, all the potential energy is converted back into kinetic energy, resulting in the same final kinetic energy as it had initially.\n\n**3. Ball B's Journey:**\n\n* Ball B is thrown downwards, meaning it starts with a downward velocity and its initial kinetic energy is increased by the gravitational potential energy.\n* As it falls, its potential energy is continuously converted into kinetic energy.\n* When it reaches the ground, all its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, resulting in a final kinetic energy equivalent to its initial kinetic energy plus the potential energy it gained from the building's height.\n\n**4. Equal Final Velocities:**\n\nSince both balls start with the same initial kinetic energy and gain the same amount of energy from their potential energy, they will have the same final kinetic energy when they reach the ground.\n\n**5. Final Velocity Calculation:**\n\nWe can use the formula for final velocity (v) in free fall:\n\nv\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as\n\n* u = initial velocity\n* a = acceleration due to gravity (g)\n* s = distance (height of the building)\n\nSince the initial velocity of both balls is the same, and they fall through the same distance, they will have the same final velocity (vA = vB).\n\n## Learning Statements:\n\nHere are some learning statements for a student preparing for NEET related to One Dimensional Motion:\n\n* **Conservation of energy:**  Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.\n* **Free fall motion:** Objects in free fall experience constant acceleration due to gravity.\n* **Equations of motion:** Understand and apply the equations of motion to solve problems involving constant acceleration.\n* **Potential and kinetic energy:** Recognize the relationship between potential and kinetic energy in various situations, including free fall.\n\n## Key Points:\n\n* This problem highlights the principle of conservation of energy in a straightforward way.\n* It emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationship between potential and kinetic energy during motion.\n* It demonstrates that the final velocity in free fall depends on the initial velocity and the distance traveled, not the direction of the initial velocity.",

It will rise to its maximum height and then fall back down.\n* **Ball 2:** The second ball is thrown 2 seconds later. To have three balls in the air, this ball needs to be thrown before the first ball hits the ground.\n* **Ball 3:** To have more than two balls in the air, the third ball needs to be thrown before the second ball hits the ground.\n\n**3.  Using the Equations of Motion**\n\n* We can use the equation of motion for displacement under constant acceleration:\n    * **s = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2** \n      where:\n        * s = displacement\n        * u = initial velocity (the throw speed)\n        * t = time\n        * a = acceleration due to gravity (g = -9.8 m/s\u00b2)\n\n* **For the first ball to hit the ground:** Its displacement (s) will be zero. Let's say it takes time 'T' for the first ball to hit the ground.\n    * 0 = uT + (1/2)(-9.8)T\u00b2\n    * Simplifying: 0 = uT - 4.9T\u00b2\n    * Solving for T:  T = u/4.9\n\n* **For the second ball to hit the ground:** It will take (T + 2) seconds because it was thrown 2 seconds later.\n    * 0 = u(T+2) + (1/2)(-9.8)(T+2)\u00b2\n    * Simplifying: 0 = u(T+2) - 4.9(T+2)\u00b2\n\n* **To have more than two balls in the air, the third ball needs to be thrown before the second ball hits the ground.** This means the time (T+2) for the second ball to hit the ground should be greater than 4 seconds (the time interval for throwing three balls).\n    * T + 2 > 4\n    * T > 2\n\n* **Substituting T = u/4.9  into the above inequality:**\n    * u/4.9 > 2\n    * u > 9.8\n\n**4.

The water is falling vertically. To ensure the water enters the tube without touching the sides, the tube needs to be tilted at a specific angle. This angle compensates for the boy's horizontal motion.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. **Visualize the Relative Motion:**  Imagine yourself as the water droplet. Since you are falling vertically, the boy and the tube appear to be moving horizontally towards you.\n\n2. **Horizontal Velocity of the Water Droplet:** Because the boy is running, the water droplet effectively has a horizontal velocity equal to the boy's velocity (v) in the opposite direction.\n\n3. **Diagram:**  Draw a diagram with the following:\n   *  A vertical line representing the water's downward velocity (u).\n   *  A horizontal line representing the water droplet's horizontal velocity (v).\n   *  The angle (\u03b8) between these two lines is the angle at which the tube needs to be tilted.\n\n4. **Trigonometry:**  The tangent of the angle (tan \u03b8) is the ratio of the opposite side (horizontal velocity, v) to the adjacent side (vertical velocity, u):\n   *  tan \u03b8 = v/u\n\n5. **Finding the Angle:**  To get the angle itself, we use the inverse tangent function:\n   *  \u03b8 = tan\u00af\u00b9(v/u)\n\n**Why this Works**\n\nBy tilting the tube at this angle, the horizontal component of the tube's opening matches the horizontal velocity of the water droplet.

The answer to the question is **1 : 3 : 5...** This is a direct consequence of Galileo's Law of Odd Numbers, which describes the relationship between the distance traveled by a freely falling object and the time it takes to fall. \n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Physics:**\n\n* **Free Fall:** When an object falls from rest under the influence of gravity alone, it undergoes uniform acceleration due to gravity (g). \n* **Constant Acceleration:** In uniform acceleration, the velocity increases linearly with time. This means the object covers more distance in each subsequent equal interval of time.\n\n**Galileo's Law of Odd Numbers:**\n\nGalileo observed that the distance traveled by a freely falling object in successive equal time intervals follows the pattern of **odd numbers**:\n\n* **1st Interval:** The object covers a certain distance (let's call it 'd').\n* **2nd Interval:** The object covers 3 times the distance of the first interval (3d).\n* **3rd Interval:** The object covers 5 times the distance of the first interval (5d).\n* **And so on...**\n\n**Mathematical Derivation:**\n\nWe can understand this law using basic equations of motion. For an object falling from rest:\n\n* **Initial velocity (u) = 0**\n* **Acceleration (a) = g (acceleration due to gravity)**\n\nUsing the equation of motion, **s = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2**, where:\n* **s** is the distance traveled\n* **t** is the time\n\nLet's calculate the distance traveled in the first, second, and third intervals:\n\n* **1st Interval (t = t):**  s\u2081 = 0 + (1/2)gt\u00b2 = (1/2)gt\u00b2 \n* **2nd Interval (t = 2t):** s\u2082 = 0 + (1/2)g(2t)\u00b2 = 2gt\u00b2 \n* **3rd Interval (t = 3t):** s\u2083 = 0 + (1/2)g(3t)\u00b2 = (9/2)gt\u00b2\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of distances:\n\n* **s\u2081 : s\u2082 : s\u2083 = (1/2)gt\u00b2 : 2gt\u00b2 : (9/2)gt\u00b2 = 1 : 4 : 9**\n\nNotice that the differences between these numbers are odd numbers (4 - 1 = 3, 9 - 4 = 5).  While the ratios are squares (1\u00b2, 2\u00b2, 3\u00b2), the **differences in distances** follow the pattern of odd numbers, which is Galileo's Law of Odd Numbers.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:**\n\n* **Understanding Free Fall:** The concept of free fall and uniform acceleration is crucial for understanding projectile motion and other related topics.\n* **Equations of Motion:** Master the use of equations of motion for constant acceleration to solve various problems.\n* **Galileo's Law:** Knowing Galileo's Law of Odd Numbers helps in visualizing and understanding the relationship between distance and time in free fall.\n* **Application:** Be able to apply these concepts to solve numerical problems based on one-dimensional motion, such as calculating distance, time, or velocity in free fall situations.\n\n**Remember, practice is key!** Solve numerous problems to solidify your understanding and develop problem-solving skills for NEET. \n",

    "4044": "Let's break down the answer and why it's correct:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts**\n\n* **Speed:** The magnitude of velocity. It's how fast an object is moving, regardless of direction.\n* **Velocity:**  Speed with direction. It describes both how fast and in what direction an object is moving.\n* **Acceleration:** The rate of change of velocity. It indicates how quickly the velocity of an object is changing.\n\n**Explanation of the Correct Answers**\n\n* **(a) with zero speed at an instant may have non-zero acceleration at that instant.** \n   * **Correct.**  Imagine a ball thrown straight up in the air. At the peak of its trajectory, its speed is momentarily zero (it stops for a split second). However, gravity is still acting on it, causing it to accelerate downwards. So, even though the speed is zero, the acceleration is non-zero.\n\n* **(c) with constant speed must have zero acceleration.**\n   * **Correct.** Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. If the speed is constant, the velocity isn't changing, and therefore acceleration is zero.\n\n**Explanation of the Incorrect Answers**\n\n* **(b) with zero speed may have non-zero velocity.** \n   * **Incorrect.**  Velocity includes both speed and direction. If the speed is zero, the velocity is also zero. \n\n* **(d) with positive value of acceleration must be speeding up.**\n   * **Incorrect.** Acceleration describes the *change* in velocity, not the velocity itself. A positive acceleration means velocity is *increasing* (speeding up) if the initial velocity is in the same direction as the acceleration. However, a positive acceleration with an initial velocity in the opposite direction means the object is *slowing down*.\n\n**Formulas**\n\n* **Velocity (v):**  v = \u0394x/\u0394t  (change in position over change in time)\n* **Acceleration (a):** a = \u0394v/\u0394t (change in velocity over change in time)\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation**\n\n* **Key Concepts:**  Master the definitions and relationships between speed, velocity, and acceleration.

    "4050": "##  Detailed Explanation:\n\nHere's the breakdown of why the answer is 105 m/s:\n\n**Understanding the Scenario:**\n\n* The police van and the thief's car are moving in the same direction. \n* The bullet fired from the van has its own velocity, which needs to be considered relative to the thief's car's velocity.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Relative Velocity:** The velocity of an object with respect to another moving object. In this case, we need to find the bullet's velocity relative to the thief's car.\n* **Frame of Reference:**  We can choose to analyze the motion from the perspective of either the police van or the thief's car.\n\n**Steps to Solve:**\n\n1. **Convert Units:**  All speeds need to be in the same units. Let's convert everything to m/s:\n   * Police van speed: 30 km/h = (30 * 1000 m) / (3600 s) = 8.33 m/s\n   * Thief's car speed: 192 km/h = (192 * 1000 m) / (3600 s) = 53.33 m/s\n\n2. **Relative Velocity:**  Calculate the velocity of the bullet relative to the thief's car. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the thief's car's velocity from the bullet's velocity:\n    * Bullet's velocity relative to the thief's car: 150 m/s - 53.33 m/s = 96.67 m/s\n\n3. **Consider the Van's Velocity:**  The bullet's velocity relative to the thief's car is 96.67 m/s, but this is with respect to the stationary ground. The police van is also moving, so we need to add the van's velocity to find the final speed with which the bullet hits the car.\n    * Final speed: 96.67 m/s + 8.33 m/s = 105 m/s\n\n**Therefore, the bullet hits the thief's car with a speed of 105 m/s.**\n\n**Relevant Formulas:**\n\n* **Relative Velocity:**  \n    * If objects are moving in the same direction: V_relative = V_object1 - V_object2 \n    * If objects are moving in opposite directions: V_relative = V_object1 + V_object2\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n* **Understanding Frames of Reference:**  The concept of relative velocity is crucial in understanding motion. You need to be able to switch between different frames of reference to solve problems.\n* **One-Dimensional Motion:** This question exemplifies the application of one-dimensional motion principles, including constant velocity, displacement, and relative velocity.\n* **Conversion of Units:**  Always ensure that all quantities are in the same units before performing calculations. \n* **Vector Addition:** The final speed of the bullet was calculated by adding the velocities of the bullet relative to the ground and the van's velocity, which involves vector addition.\n\nBy mastering these concepts and practicing similar problems, you can confidently tackle questions related to one-dimensional motion on the NEET exam. \n"
