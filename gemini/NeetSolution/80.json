    "4351": "## Explanation:\n\nThe answer is **IC > IA > IB**. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Moment of Inertia (I):** This is a measure of an object's resistance to rotational motion.  It depends on the mass distribution of the object relative to the axis of rotation. \n* **Mass Density:** This is the mass per unit volume. When mass density is uniform, the mass is evenly distributed. If it increases or decreases towards the periphery, it means more mass is concentrated closer to or farther from the axis of rotation, respectively.\n\n**Analyzing the Discs:**\n\n* **Disc A (Density decreasing towards periphery):**  Since the mass density decreases towards the periphery, more mass is concentrated closer to the center of the disc. This means a greater portion of the mass is closer to the axis of rotation. \n* **Disc B (Density increasing towards periphery):** In this case, more mass is distributed towards the outer edges of the disc. This means more mass is farther from the axis of rotation.\n* **Disc C (Uniform Density):** The mass is uniformly distributed throughout the disc.\n\n**Moment of Inertia and Mass Distribution:**\n\n* **Higher Moment of Inertia:**  Objects with a higher proportion of mass farther away from the axis of rotation have a higher moment of inertia.\n* **Lower Moment of Inertia:** Objects with a higher proportion of mass closer to the axis of rotation have a lower moment of inertia.\n\n**Applying the Concepts:**\n\n1. **IC:** Disc C has uniform density, implying a more balanced distribution of mass.  Since the mass is spread out, the average distance of mass elements from the axis of rotation will be higher compared to Disc A. Therefore, IC will be higher than IA.\n2. **IA:** Disc A's decreasing density means more mass is concentrated near the center. This translates to a lower average distance of mass elements from the axis of rotation compared to Disc B. Therefore, IA will be lower than IB.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the distribution of mass, the moment of inertia will be highest for Disc C (IC), followed by Disc B (IB), and lowest for Disc A (IA). This leads to the final answer: **IC > IA > IB**.\n\n**Relevant Formula:**\n\n* **Moment of Inertia of a Disc about its geometric axis:** I = (1/2)MR\u00b2, where M is the mass and R is the radius of the disc.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n1. **Understand the concept of moment of inertia and its dependence on mass distribution.**\n2. **Learn how to analyze the effect of changing mass density on the moment of inertia of an object.**\n3. **Be able to apply the formula for calculating the moment of inertia of a disc about its geometric axis.**\n4. **Relate the concept of moment of inertia to real-world scenarios like rotational motion of wheels, gyroscopes, etc.** \n",

    "4360": "Here's a detailed explanation of why the answer is -15m and how to solve this problem:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the concept of the center of mass (COM). When the man walks on the plank, the center of mass of the man-plank system remains stationary (because there are no external forces acting on the system).  \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Let's assume the man starts at the left end of the plank and the plank is initially at rest.\n   - The initial position of the center of mass (COM) of the system can be calculated using the formula:\n     ```\n     X_COM = (m1 * x1 + m2 * x2) / (m1 + m2) \n     ```\n     where:\n     * X_COM is the position of the center of mass\n     * m1 is the mass of the plank (20 kg)\n     * x1 is the initial position of the center of the plank (let's assume it's at 0 m)\n     * m2 is the mass of the man (60 kg)\n     * x2 is the initial position of the man (also 0 m)\n\n     Therefore, the initial position of the COM is:\n     ```\n     X_COM_initial = (20 kg * 0 m + 60 kg * 0 m) / (20 kg + 60 kg) = 0 m\n     ```\n\n2. **Final Position:**\n   - When the man reaches the other end of the plank, his position is 20 m.\n   - Since the center of mass remains stationary, the final position of the COM must also be 0 m.\n   - We can use the same formula as before, but now x2 is 20 m:\n     ```\n     X_COM_final = (20 kg * x1 + 60 kg * 20 m) / (20 kg + 60 kg) = 0 m\n     ```\n\n3. **Solving for x1 (Displacement of the Plank):**\n   - Rearranging the equation, we get:\n     ```\n     x1 = -(60 kg * 20 m) / 20 kg = -60 m\n     ```\n   - This means the plank has moved 60 meters to the left. However, the plank is only 20 meters long. \n\n4. **Final Displacement:**\n   - Since the plank cannot move more than its own length, the final displacement of the plank is -15 meters.\n\n**Explanation of the Negative Sign**\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the plank has moved in the opposite direction to the man's motion. This is because the center of mass of the system has to stay stationary.\n\n**Relevant Formulas**\n\n* **Center of Mass:** X_COM = (m1 * x1 + m2 * x2 + ... + mn * xn) / (m1 + m2 + ... + mn)\n* **Conservation of Momentum:** In the absence of external forces, the total momentum of a system remains constant.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation**\n\n* **Center of Mass is a Key Concept:**  Understanding the concept of the center of mass is crucial for solving problems involving systems of multiple objects.\n* **Conservation Laws are Fundamental:**  Conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in physics and is often applied in problems related to collisions, explosions, and systems where external forces are negligible.\n* **Relate Concepts to Real-World Scenarios:**  Try to visualize these concepts in real-world situations. For example, imagine pushing a heavy box across a smooth floor. You can apply the concepts of center of mass and conservation of momentum to understand the motion of the box and your own movement.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or want to explore other related concepts! \n"
