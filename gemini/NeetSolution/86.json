Here's the problem:\n\n* **Temperature Dependence:** The rms velocity of gas molecules is directly proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature. This means that as temperature increases, the rms velocity increases. \n* **Mass Dependence:**  The rms velocity is also inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass of the gas. This means lighter molecules move faster at the same temperature.\n\n**The Flaw in the Question**\n\nThe question tries to establish a fixed ratio (1/3) between the rms velocities of O\u2082 and H\u2082 at two different temperatures.  This is impossible because:\n\n1. **Different Molar Masses:** Oxygen (O\u2082) is much heavier than hydrogen (H\u2082). This means, even at the same temperature, O\u2082 molecules will always have a lower rms velocity than H\u2082 molecules. \n2. **Temperature Influence:**  Changing the temperature will affect the rms velocities of both gases, but it won't maintain a fixed ratio of 1/3 between them.\n\n**How to Correct the Question**\n\nThe question can be corrected in several ways:\n\n1. **Finding the Temperature at which O\u2082 has a Specific Velocity:** The question could ask for the temperature at which O\u2082 has a specific rms velocity (e.g., \"What temperature is needed for the rms velocity of O\u2082 to be 100 m/s?\"). \n2. **Finding the Ratio at a Specific Temperature:** The question could ask for the ratio of rms velocities of O\u2082 and H\u2082 at a given temperature (e.g., \"What is the ratio of the rms velocities of O\u2082 and H\u2082 at 27\u00b0C?\").\n\n**Solving the Correct Question**\n\nLet's assume the corrected question asks: \"What is the ratio of the rms velocities of O\u2082 and H\u2082 at -3\u00b0C?\"\n\n**Formula:**\n\nThe rms velocity of a gas is given by:\n\n```\nv_rms = \u221a(3RT/M)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* v_rms = root-mean-square velocity\n* R = ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol\u00b7K)\n* T = absolute temperature (in Kelvin)\n* M = molar mass of the gas (in kg/mol)\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Convert Temperature to Kelvin:** -3\u00b0C = 270 K\n2. **Calculate rms Velocity of H\u2082:**\n    * Molar mass of H\u2082 (M_H\u2082) = 2 g/mol = 0.002 kg/mol\n    * v_rms(H\u2082) = \u221a(3 * 8.314 J/mol\u00b7K * 270 K / 0.002 kg/mol) = 1843 m/s \n3. **Calculate rms Velocity of O\u2082:**\n    * Molar mass of O\u2082 (M_O\u2082) = 32 g/mol = 0.032 kg/mol\n    * v_rms(O\u2082) = \u221a(3 * 8.314 J/mol\u00b7K * 270 K / 0.032 kg/mol) = 460.8 m/s\n4. **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    * Ratio = v_rms(O\u2082) / v_rms(H\u2082) = 460.8 m/s / 1843 m/s \u2248 0.25\n\n**Answer:** At -3\u00b0C, the ratio of the rms velocities of O\u2082 to H\u2082 is approximately 0.25.

It's a useful model to understand gas behavior.\n* **Constant Pressure Expansion:**  This means the gas is expanding against a fixed external pressure.  \n* **Straight Line on a Graph:** The straight line on a graph implies a linear relationship between the variables being plotted. \n\n**Why the Answer is B**\n\nHere's why the expansion of the gas with mass 2m and pressure 2P will be represented by the same line (B):\n\n1. **Boyle's Law:** The relationship between pressure (P) and volume (V) of an ideal gas at constant temperature is given by Boyle's Law:\n\n   * P\u2081V\u2081 = P\u2082V\u2082\n\n   This means if you double the pressure, you halve the volume, and vice-versa, keeping the temperature constant.\n\n2. **Constant Pressure:** The question states the expansion is at constant pressure.  This means the pressure doesn't change during the expansion, regardless of the mass of the gas.\n\n3. **Mass and Volume:** While the mass of the gas is doubled, it doesn't directly affect the relationship between pressure and volume under constant pressure conditions.

    "4564": "## Explanation:\n\nThe answer \"Low boiling point due to low pressure\" is correct. Here's why:\n\n**Kinetic Theory of Gases and Boiling Point:**\n\n* **Kinetic Theory of Gases:** This theory explains the behavior of gases based on the motion of their molecules. It states that gas molecules are in constant random motion and possess kinetic energy.\n* **Boiling Point:** The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the surrounding atmospheric pressure. \n* **Vapor Pressure:** The pressure exerted by the vapor of a liquid in equilibrium with its liquid phase.\n\n**Effect of Altitude on Boiling Point:**\n\n* **Decreasing Pressure:** As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases.\n* **Lower Boiling Point:** With lower atmospheric pressure, the liquid needs to reach a lower temperature to achieve vapor pressure equal to the surrounding pressure, resulting in a lower boiling point.\n\n**Why it's difficult to cook rice at high altitudes:**\n\n* **Undercooked Rice:**  Water boils at a lower temperature at high altitudes, meaning the rice doesn't receive enough heat to cook properly.\n* **Longer Cooking Time:**  To compensate for the lower boiling point, you would need to cook the rice for a longer time. However, this can lead to overcooking and mushy rice.\n\n**Relevant Formula:** \n\nWhile there's no specific formula to calculate the exact change in boiling point with altitude, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation can be used to relate vapor pressure and temperature:\n\n```\ndP/dT = Hvap / (T * \u0394V)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* dP/dT:  Change in vapor pressure with respect to temperature.\n* Hvap: Enthalpy of vaporization.\n* T: Temperature in Kelvin.\n* \u0394V: Change in volume between liquid and vapor phases.\n\n**Step-by-step approach:**\n\n1. Understand that altitude affects atmospheric pressure.\n2. Lower atmospheric pressure leads to a lower boiling point of water.\n3. Lower boiling point means rice won't cook properly at standard cooking times.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET:**\n\n* **Kinetic Theory of Gases:**  Understand the relationship between temperature, pressure, and molecular motion in gases. \n* **Boiling Point:** Understand how boiling point is influenced by atmospheric pressure.\n* **Clausius-Clapeyron Equation:**  This equation provides a quantitative relationship between vapor pressure, temperature, and enthalpy of vaporization.\n* **Altitude Effects:**  Be aware of how altitude affects various physical phenomena, particularly boiling point and atmospheric pressure.\n* **Cooking at High Altitudes:**  Understand the challenges and adjustments needed when cooking at high altitudes.\n\nThese learning points will equip you with the knowledge to understand and solve related questions in NEET. \n",
    "4565": "## Explanation:\n\nThe Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution curve describes the distribution of speeds of molecules in a gas at a given temperature.  Here's why the answer is T\u2081 < T\u2082:\n\n**1.  Shape of the Curve:**\n\n- **Higher Temperature (T\u2082):** The curve is wider and flatter, meaning a larger fraction of molecules have higher speeds. This is because at higher temperatures, molecules have more kinetic energy, causing them to move faster.\n- **Lower Temperature (T\u2081):** The curve is narrower and taller, indicating a smaller fraction of molecules with higher speeds. Most molecules at lower temperatures have slower speeds due to less kinetic energy.\n\n**2.  Average Speed:**\n\n- The peak of the curve represents the **most probable speed**. \n- As temperature increases, the peak shifts towards the right, indicating a higher **average speed** for the molecules. This is directly related to the average kinetic energy, which is proportional to temperature.\n\n**3.  Area under the Curve:**\n\n- The **area under the curve** represents the total number of molecules in the system. This area remains constant regardless of temperature.  It's just the distribution of speeds within that number of molecules that changes.\n\n**4.  Formula Connection:**\n\n- The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly proportional to the absolute temperature:\n    **KE = (3/2) kT**\n    where KE is kinetic energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the absolute temperature.\n- Since kinetic energy is related to the square of velocity (KE = (1/2)mv\u00b2), higher temperature implies higher average velocity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the Maxwell velocity distribution curve at a higher temperature (T\u2082) will be wider and flatter than the curve at a lower temperature (T\u2081). This is because the molecules at a higher temperature have more kinetic energy and therefore move faster, leading to a broader range of speeds.\n\n## Learning Statements for NEET:\n\n- **Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:** Understand the concept of how molecular speeds are distributed in a gas.\n- **Temperature dependence of speed:**  Higher temperatures result in a wider distribution of speeds and a higher average speed.\n- **Kinetic energy and temperature:**  Kinetic energy is directly proportional to absolute temperature.\n- **Average speed and temperature:** The average speed of gas molecules increases with temperature.\n\n**Key takeaway:** The Maxwell velocity distribution curve is a valuable tool for understanding the behavior of gases and their relationship with temperature. For NEET preparation, focus on understanding the fundamental principles of the kinetic theory of gases and how it relates to real-world phenomena. \n"
