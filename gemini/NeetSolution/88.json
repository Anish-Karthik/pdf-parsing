Electric Field:**\n\n* **Electric field due to a point charge:** The electric field at a point due to a point charge is given by Coulomb's Law:\n    ```\n    E = kQ/r\u00b2 \n    ```\n    where:\n    * E is the electric field strength\n    * k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 x 10\u2079 N\u22c5m\u00b2/C\u00b2)\n    * Q is the magnitude of the charge\n    * r is the distance from the charge to the point \n* **Vector Sum:** The electric field at the center of the triangle is the vector sum of the electric fields due to each of the three charges. \n* **Symmetry:** Due to the equilateral triangle symmetry, the electric field components due to the two charges of -q cancel each other out at the center.  However, the electric field due to the +2q charge remains. \n* **Therefore, the net electric field at the center is non-zero and directed towards the +2q charge.**\n\n**2. Electric Potential:**\n\n* **Electric potential due to a point charge:** The electric potential at a point due to a point charge is given by:\n    ```\n    V = kQ/r\n    ```\n    where:\n    * V is the electric potential\n    * k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 x 10\u2079 N\u22c5m\u00b2/C\u00b2)\n    * Q is the magnitude of the charge\n    * r is the distance from the charge to the point\n* **Scalar Sum:** The electric potential at the center is the scalar sum of the potentials due to each of the three charges.\n* **Symmetry:** Again, due to the equilateral triangle symmetry, the distances from each charge to the center are the same.  The potential due to the +2q charge is twice the magnitude of the potential due to each of the -q charges, but opposite in sign. \n* **Therefore, the net electric potential at the center is zero.**\n\n**Steps to Solve:**\n\n1. **Draw a diagram:** Draw an equilateral triangle with the charges placed at the vertices.

Here's why:\n\n* **Equipotential Surfaces:** A conductor, by its nature, allows free movement of charges within it. When an external electric field is applied, charges redistribute themselves on the surface of the conductor to cancel out the electric field inside. This redistribution results in a constant potential throughout the conductor, making its surface an equipotential surface. \n\n* **Electric Field Lines and Equipotential Surfaces:** Electric field lines always point in the direction of decreasing potential.  Therefore, on an equipotential surface, where the potential is constant, the electric field lines must be perpendicular to the surface. This is because if the field lines weren't perpendicular, there would be a component of the field along the surface, leading to a potential difference across the surface, contradicting the equipotential nature of the conductor.\n\n**In summary:**  The equipotential nature of the conductor's surface necessitates that the electric field lines are perpendicular to the surface, ensuring the potential remains constant across the conductor.\n\n## Steps involved in solving:\n\n1. **Understanding the Concepts:**\n   - Recognize that conductors allow free movement of charges.\n   - Understand that equipotential surfaces have a constant potential.\n   - Know that electric field lines point in the direction of decreasing potential.\n\n2. **Applying the Concepts:**\n   - Apply the knowledge of equipotential surfaces to conductors, realizing their surfaces are equipotential.\n   - Connect the concept of equipotential surfaces to the direction of electric field lines.\n   - Conclude that due to the equipotential nature of the conductor's surface, the electric field lines must be perpendicular to it.\n\n## Relevant Formulas:\n\n- **Electric potential due to a point charge:**  V = kQ/r, where:\n   - V is the electric potential\n   - k is Coulomb's constant (9 \u00d7 10^9 Nm^2/C^2)\n   - Q is the charge\n   - r is the distance from the charge\n\n- **Electric field due to a point charge:** E = kQ/r^2, where:\n   - E is the electric field strength\n   - k, Q, and r are defined as above\n\n## Learning Statements:\n\n* **Conductors are equipotential in electrostatic equilibrium:** This means that the potential at any point on the surface of a conductor is the same. This is due to the free movement of charges within the conductor, allowing them to redistribute themselves to cancel out any internal electric fields.\n* **Electric field lines are always perpendicular to equipotential surfaces:** This is a fundamental principle of electrostatics and is directly related to the concept of potential difference.

    "4623": "## Explanation of the Answer\n\nThe given answer is **correct**. Here's why:\n\n**Assertion:** When charges are shared between two parallel plate capacitors, the charge of the system is conserved but some energy is lost.\n\n* **Charge Conservation:**  The total charge of an isolated system remains constant. This is a fundamental principle of electrostatics. When charges are shared between two capacitors, the charge is merely redistributed, but the total amount remains the same.\n* **Energy Loss:** While the total charge remains constant, the distribution of charge changes. Initially, the capacitors might have different potential differences, leading to an uneven distribution of energy. When the charges are shared, the potential differences equalize, leading to a more uniform distribution of energy. However, this redistribution is not perfectly efficient. Some energy is lost due to factors like:\n    * **Internal Resistance:**  Capacitors have some internal resistance, which dissipates energy as heat during the charge redistribution process.\n    * **Electromagnetic Radiation:** The changing electric fields during the charge redistribution can radiate some energy away.\n\n**Reason:** During the sharing of charges, some energy is dissipated as heat.\n\n* **Heat Dissipation:** As mentioned above, internal resistance of the capacitors and other factors contribute to energy dissipation as heat. This is a common occurrence in any system with resistance, and capacitors are no exception.\n\n**Why the Reason is a Correct Explanation of the Assertion:**\n\nThe reason directly explains the energy loss mentioned in the assertion.

This means we want to find a single capacitor that would behave identically to the entire network of capacitors. \n\n**Solution**\n\n1. **Identifying Series and Parallel Connections:**\n   * The capacitors directly connected between A and B (the top and bottom ones) are in parallel.\n   * The two capacitors in the middle are in series.\n\n2. **Calculating Equivalent Capacitance for Series:**\n   * For capacitors in series, the reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance is the sum of the reciprocals of individual capacitances:\n     ```\n     1/C_eq = 1/C\u2081 + 1/C\u2082 \n     ```\n   * In our case,  C\u2081 = C and C\u2082 = C, so:\n     ```\n     1/C_eq = 1/C + 1/C = 2/C \n     ```\n     * Therefore, the equivalent capacitance of the series combination is:\n       ```\n       C_eq (series) = C/2\n       ```\n\n3. **Calculating Equivalent Capacitance for Parallel:**\n   * For capacitors in parallel, the equivalent capacitance is the sum of individual capacitances:\n     ```\n     C_eq = C\u2081 + C\u2082 \n     ```\n   * In our case, one capacitor has C/2 (the equivalent of the series combination) and the other has C:\n     ```\n     C_eq (parallel) = C/2 + C = 3C/2\n     ```\n\n4. **Final Step:**\n    * The equivalent capacitance of the entire circuit is the equivalent capacitance of the parallel combination:\n      ```\n      C_eq (total) = 3C/2\n      ```\n\n**Answer:** The equivalent capacitance between points A and B is **3C/2**.\n\n**Important Note:**  The provided answer of 2C is incorrect. \n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation**\n\n* **Capacitance Basics:** Understand the definition of capacitance (the ability of a capacitor to store charge) and its dependence on the geometry of the capacitor (area of plates and distance between them).\n* **Series and Parallel Combinations:** Mastery of series and parallel combination rules for capacitors is crucial.
