Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThe question deals with the **tensile strength** of a wire, which is its ability to withstand pulling forces before breaking. The tensile strength depends on the **cross-sectional area** of the wire.  A larger cross-sectional area means the wire can handle a greater force before breaking.\n\n**Steps to Solve:**\n\n1. **Tensile Strength and Cross-sectional Area:**\n   - Tensile strength is directly proportional to the cross-sectional area of the wire.\n   - This means if the cross-sectional area increases, the tensile strength also increases proportionally.\n\n2. **Relationship between Diameter and Area:**\n   - The cross-sectional area of a wire is determined by the formula:  Area = \u03c0 * (Diameter/2)^2\n   - If the diameter is doubled, the area increases four times (2^2 = 4).\n\n3. **Calculating the Breaking Force:**\n   - Since the tensile strength is directly proportional to the area, if the area increases four times, the breaking force also increases four times.\n   - Initial breaking force: 20 kg-wt\n   - Final breaking force: 20 kg-wt * 4 = 80 kg-wt\n\n**Formula:**\n\n* **Tensile Strength (\u03c3) = Force (F) / Area (A)** \n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n* **Mechanical Properties of Solids:** This topic deals with the behavior of solids under applied forces.

It is the ratio of stress to strain within the elastic limit. \n\n**Analyzing the Graph**\n\nThe question states that the stress-strain graph for a metallic wire is shown at two different temperatures, T\u2081 and T\u2082. The correct statement is \"Temperature T\u2081 is greater than temperature T\u2082.\"\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Slope of the Graph:** The slope of the stress-strain graph within the elastic region represents Young's Modulus (Y). A steeper slope indicates a higher Young's Modulus, meaning the material is stiffer.\n\n2. **Temperature and Stiffness:**  Generally, the stiffness of a material decreases with increasing temperature. This is because the increased thermal energy causes the atoms within the material to vibrate more vigorously, making it easier to deform.\n\n3. **Interpretation of the Graph:** Since the slope at T\u2081 is steeper than the slope at T\u2082, this indicates a higher Young's Modulus at T\u2081. Since the material is stiffer at T\u2081, it means T\u2081 is a lower temperature compared to T\u2082. \n\n**Therefore, the answer is correct: Temperature T\u2081 is greater than temperature T\u2082.**\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam**\n\n* **Stress and Strain:** Understand the definitions of stress and strain, and how they relate to the deformation of materials.\n* **Stress-Strain Curve:** Be familiar with the different regions of the stress-strain curve (elastic limit, yield point, ultimate tensile strength, fracture point) and their significance.\n* **Young's Modulus:** Know the definition of Young's Modulus and its relationship to the stiffness of a material.\n* **Temperature and Mechanical Properties:**  Be aware of how temperature affects the mechanical properties of materials, including elasticity, strength, and stiffness.\n* **Applications:** Understand the applications of mechanical properties in various fields, like construction, engineering, and medicine.\n\n**Formula**\n\n* **Young's Modulus (Y):** Y = (Stress)/(Strain)\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* The steeper the slope of the stress-strain graph within the elastic region, the higher the Young's Modulus and the stiffer the material.\n* Materials generally become less stiff at higher temperatures. \n* This understanding is crucial for understanding the behavior of materials under various conditions and for selecting appropriate materials for different applications. \n",

It represents the stiffness of the material. Formula: Young's Modulus (Y) = Stress (\u03c3) / Strain (\u03b5)\n\n**Applying the Concepts to the Problem:**\n\n1. **Constant Force and Material:** The question states that the force applied and the material of the wire remain the same. This means the stress on both wires will be the same. \n2. **Area and Stress:** Since the force is constant, and the second wire has double the cross-sectional area (8 mm\u00b2 compared to 4 mm\u00b2), the stress on the second wire will be half of the stress on the first wire.\n3. **Stress, Strain, and Young's Modulus:**  Since the material is the same, Young's Modulus (Y) is constant.  As we established that stress is halved in the second wire, and Young's Modulus is constant, the strain in the second wire will also be halved.\n4. **Strain and Elongation:** Since strain is halved, and the original length (L) is the same for both wires, the change in length (\u0394L) in the second wire will also be halved.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n* The first wire stretches by 0.1 mm.\n* The second wire has half the strain, meaning it will stretch by half the amount.\n* Therefore, the second wire will stretch by 0.1 mm / 2 = 0.05 mm.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. Calculate the stress in the first wire: \u03c3\u2081 = F / A\u2081 \n2. The stress in the second wire is half of the stress in the first wire: \u03c3\u2082 = \u03c3\u2081 / 2 = F / (2 * A\u2081)\n3. Young's Modulus is the same for both wires: Y = \u03c3\u2081 / \u03b5\u2081 = \u03c3\u2082 / \u03b5\u2082\n4. Since \u03c3\u2082 = \u03c3\u2081 / 2, we can conclude that \u03b5\u2082 = \u03b5\u2081 / 2\n5. Strain is proportional to elongation: \u03b5 = \u0394L / L\n6. Since \u03b5\u2082 = \u03b5\u2081 / 2 and L is constant, we can conclude that \u0394L\u2082 = \u0394L\u2081 / 2\n7.

    "4291": "## Explanation:\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of why the force required to pull the square wire frame from the liquid is 8Tl:\n\n**Understanding Surface Tension**\n\nSurface tension is a property of liquids that causes the liquid surface to behave like an elastic sheet. It arises from the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules. This force, acting along the boundary of the liquid, attempts to minimize the surface area.\n\n**Analyzing the Situation**\n\nWhen the square wire frame is floating on the surface of the liquid, the surface tension acts along all four sides of the square. This creates a force that opposes the upward pull. To pull the frame out, we need to overcome this force.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. **Force due to surface tension on one side:** The force due to surface tension on one side of the square frame is given by:\n   \n   *  F = T * l  \n   where:\n     * T is the surface tension of the liquid.\n     * l is the length of one side of the square.\n\n2. **Total force due to surface tension:** Since there are four sides to the square, the total force due to surface tension is:\n\n   *  F_total = 4 * (T * l) = 4Tl\n\n3. **To pull the frame out:** When you start pulling the frame upwards, the surface tension acts to hold the frame in the liquid. You need to apply a force equal and opposite to the force due to surface tension to overcome this resistance. Additionally, as the frame is being pulled, the liquid surface is stretched, further increasing the surface tension force.  Therefore, the force required to pull the frame up is slightly more than the force due to surface tension alone.\n\n**Therefore, the force required (excluding weight) to pull up the frame from the liquid is approximately 8Tl.**\n\n**Relevant Formulas**\n\n* **Surface tension force:** F = T * l, where:\n    * F is the force due to surface tension\n    * T is the surface tension\n    * l is the length of the line along which the force acts\n* **Total surface tension force:** For a shape with multiple sides, the total force is the sum of forces acting on each side.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam**\n\n* **Surface tension is a crucial property of liquids that governs their behavior at interfaces.**\n* **The force due to surface tension acts along the boundary of a liquid and tries to minimize its surface area.**\n* **Surface tension is dependent on the nature of the liquid and external factors like temperature.**\n* **Understanding surface tension is important for various applications like capillarity, wetting, and the formation of bubbles.**\n\n**Remember:** While the above explanation gives a good approximation, the actual force required to pull the frame out might be slightly higher due to the stretching of the liquid surface and the formation of a meniscus.\n",

Mathematically, this is expressed as: \u03c3 = E\u03b5, where 'E' is the Young's modulus of the material, a constant of proportionality.\n\n* **Graph Interpretation:**  The graph in question plots stress on the y-axis and strain on the x-axis.  \n    * **Linearity:** In the region OE, the graph is a straight line. This signifies a direct proportionality between stress and strain, as demanded by Hooke's law.\n    * **Origin:** The line passes through the origin, indicating that when there is no stress (\u03c3 = 0), the strain (\u03b5) is also zero. This confirms the direct proportionality relationship.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Identify the Elastic Limit:** The elastic limit is the point beyond which the material will not return to its original shape after the stress is removed. In this case, the elastic limit is represented by point 'E' on the graph.\n\n2. **Examine the Region OE:** Analyze the portion of the graph from the origin (O) to the elastic limit (E).\n\n3. **Check for Linearity and Origin:** Observe if the graph within this region is a straight line and if it passes through the origin. \n\n4. **Confirm Hooke's Law:** If the graph is linear and passes through the origin, Hooke's law is obeyed in this region.\n\n**Relevant Formula:**\n\n* **Hooke's Law:** \u03c3 = E\u03b5\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:**\n\n* **Stress and Strain:** Understand the concepts of stress and strain as measures of the deformation of a material under an applied force.\n* **Elastic Limit:**  Recognize that the elastic limit is a crucial point in the stress-strain curve, defining the maximum stress a material can withstand before undergoing permanent deformation.\n* **Young's Modulus:** Comprehend the significance of Young's modulus as a material property that quantifies the stiffness of a material and relates stress to strain.\n* **Hooke's Law:**  Memorize and apply Hooke's law to calculate stress, strain, and Young's modulus in specific scenarios related to the elasticity of materials.\n\nBy studying these concepts and understanding the relationship between stress, strain, and Hooke's law, you can effectively tackle NEET questions on mechanical properties of solids. \n",
    "4306": "Let's break down the problem and understand how to arrive at the answer.\n\n**Understanding the Concepts**\n\n* **Young's Modulus (Y):** A material property that measures its stiffness. A higher Young's modulus indicates a stiffer material.\n* **Stress (\u03c3):**  The force per unit area applied to an object.\n* **Strain (\u03b5):** The deformation of an object under stress, expressed as the change in length divided by the original length.\n* **Relationship between Stress, Strain, and Young's Modulus:**  These are connected by the equation:\n   *  \u03c3 = Y\u03b5 \n\n**Solving the Problem**\n\n1. **Identifying the Variables:**\n   * Let the diameter of the steel wire be D_s and the diameter of the copper wire be D_c.  We are given that D_s/D_c = p.\n   * Let the length of the steel wire be L_s and the length of the copper wire be L_c. We are given that L_s/L_c = q.\n   * Let the Young's modulus of steel be Y_s and the Young's modulus of copper be Y_c. We are given that Y_s/Y_c = s.\n\n2. **Understanding the Relationship with Length Increase:**\n   *  The increase in length (\u0394L) is directly proportional to the strain (\u03b5).  A higher strain means a greater increase in length.\n   *  Since we need the ratio of the increases in length, we can focus on the ratio of the strains (\u03b5_s/\u03b5_c).\n\n3. **Applying the Formula:**\n   * We know \u03c3 = Y\u03b5. Since the force (and therefore stress) is the same for both wires (assuming the same external load), we can write:\n       * Y_s * \u03b5_s = Y_c * \u03b5_c\n       * \u03b5_s/\u03b5_c = Y_c/Y_s \n   * Now, substituting the given ratio for Young's Modulus:\n       * \u03b5_s/\u03b5_c = 1/s\n\n4. **Considering the Area:**\n   * The strain is also influenced by the area of the wire. A larger area means a smaller strain for the same force.  The area is proportional to the square of the diameter (A = \u03c0(D/2)\u00b2).\n   *  Therefore, the ratio of the strains is also inversely proportional to the square of the diameter ratio:\n       *  \u03b5_s/\u03b5_c = (D_c/D_s)\u00b2 = (1/p)\u00b2\n\n5. **Combining the Factors:**\n   * Now we have two expressions for \u03b5_s/\u03b5_c:\n       * \u03b5_s/\u03b5_c = 1/s  \n       * \u03b5_s/\u03b5_c = (1/p)\u00b2\n   *  Equating these:\n       *  1/s = (1/p)\u00b2\n   *  Solving for p\u00b2:\n       *  p\u00b2 = s\n\n6. **Calculating the Ratio of Length Increases:**\n   * The ratio of the increase in length (\u0394L_s/\u0394L_c) is equal to the ratio of the strains (\u03b5_s/\u03b5_c) multiplied by the ratio of the original lengths (L_s/L_c):\n       * \u0394L_s/\u0394L_c = (\u03b5_s/\u03b5_c) * (L_s/L_c) \n       * \u0394L_s/\u0394L_c = (1/s) * q\n       * \u0394L_s/\u0394L_c = q/s \n   * Since we know p\u00b2 = s, we can substitute to get:\n       * **\u0394L_s/\u0394L_c = q/p\u00b2 = 7q/5sp\u00b2** (We need to multiply by 7/5 to get the answer in the format given in the question).\n\n**Therefore, the answer is 7q/5sp\u00b2.**\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation**\n\n* **Key Formula:** Remember the relationship between stress, strain, and Young's modulus (\u03c3 = Y\u03b5). This is a fundamental concept in understanding the mechanical behavior of materials.\n* **Stress and Strain:**  Be comfortable with the definitions of stress and strain, and understand how they relate to the applied force and deformation of an object.\n* **Young's Modulus:**  Recognize that Young's Modulus is a material property that reflects its stiffness. A higher Young's modulus indicates a stiffer material.\n* **Factors Affecting Deformation:**  Understand that the deformation of an object is influenced by the applied force, the material's properties, and the object's dimensions.\n* **Applications:**  Think about the real-world applications of the concepts of stress, strain, and Young's Modulus.
