Since the flux is decreasing, the induced current will create a magnetic field that tries to maintain the original flux.\n\n**4. Determining the Direction:**\n\n* **Lenz's Law:**  Lenz's Law provides a handy rule to determine the direction of the induced current: \"The induced current will flow in a direction such that its magnetic field opposes the change in magnetic flux.\"\n* **Right Hand Rule:**  To apply Lenz's Law, we use the right-hand rule.

The rate of change of this flux is what drives the induced EMF.\n* **Induced EMF:** The induced EMF is the voltage generated in the coil due to the changing magnetic flux.\n* **Induced Current:** The induced EMF drives an induced current in the coil, following Ohm's law (I = V/R, where R is the coil's resistance).\n* **Induced Charge:** The total amount of charge that flows through the coil is determined by the product of the induced current and the time for which the current flows.\n\n**Analyzing the Situation**\n\n1. **Speed and Magnetic Flux:** When the magnet moves faster, the magnetic field lines cut through the coil more rapidly. This means the rate of change of magnetic flux is higher.\n2. **EMF and Current:**  A higher rate of change of magnetic flux directly leads to a higher induced EMF (Faraday's Law).  Since the coil's resistance remains constant, a higher EMF results in a higher induced current.\n3. **Charge and Time:** While the induced current is higher, the time for which it flows is *shorter* when the magnet moves faster. This is because the magnet reaches the coil quicker.\n\n**Why Q Doesn't Increase**\n\nThe induced charge (Q) is the product of the induced current (I) and the time (t) for which the current flows:\n\n  Q = I * t\n\nWhile the induced current (I) increases when the speed is doubled, the time (t) decreases proportionally.

How it applies to the scenario:**\n\n* As the magnet oscillates, it creates a changing magnetic field through the coil C. \n* When the North Pole of the magnet moves towards the coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases.

The direction of this induced current is such that it creates a magnetic field opposing the increasing magnetic field of the magnet (Lenz's Law).\n* As the North Pole moves away from the coil, the magnetic flux decreases. This again induces an EMF, but this time in the opposite direction, resulting in a current flow in the opposite direction through the galvanometer.\n* The oscillating magnet thus causes a fluctuating magnetic flux through the coil, resulting in an alternating current (AC) through the galvanometer. This causes the needle of the galvanometer to deflect to the left and right.\n\n**3. Why the amplitude decreases:**\n\n* The amplitude of the oscillations decreases because the induced current in the coil creates a magnetic field that opposes the motion of the magnet.

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Concept**\n\nThe ratio L/R (inductance to resistance) is a crucial parameter in electrical circuits, particularly in circuits involving inductors.  Here's a breakdown of its significance:\n\n* **Inductance (L):**  Inductance is the property of a circuit element (like a coil) to oppose changes in current. It's measured in Henrys (H). A higher inductance means a stronger opposition to current changes.\n* **Resistance (R):** Resistance is the opposition to the flow of electrical current. It's measured in Ohms (\u03a9).  Higher resistance means less current flow.\n\n**The Importance of L/R**\n\nThe ratio L/R  is known as the **time constant (\u03c4)** of an RL circuit (a circuit with an inductor and resistor). It determines how quickly the current in the circuit rises or falls when the voltage is applied or removed.\n\n* **Larger L/R:**  A larger L/R value indicates a **longer** time constant. This means the current takes a longer time to reach its steady-state value. \n* **Smaller L/R:** A smaller L/R value means a **shorter** time constant. The current reaches its steady-state value more quickly.\n\n**Why the Answer is \"All of these\"**\n\nThe question is designed to test your understanding of the time constant and its relationship to the units of inductance and resistance. Since the time constant (\u03c4) is measured in seconds, the dimensions of L/R must also be seconds. Let's examine why each of the options is correct:\n\n* **Seconds (s):** This is the standard unit of time, and it is directly the unit of the time constant.\n* **Henry/Ohm (H/\u03a9):**  Since inductance (L) is measured in Henrys (H) and resistance (R) is measured in Ohms (\u03a9), the ratio L/R has dimensions of H/\u03a9.\n* **Weber/Ampere (Wb/A):**  We can express inductance as the ratio of magnetic flux (Wb) to current (A). Therefore, L/R also has the dimensions of Wb/A.\n\n**In essence, all of these options represent the same fundamental quantity - time (seconds) - expressed in different units.**\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam**\n\nHere are some learning statements related to electromagnetic induction relevant to the question:\n\n* **Faraday's Law:**  Understand how changing magnetic fields induce an electromotive force (EMF) in a circuit, and how this relates to the concept of inductance.\n* **Lenz's Law:**  Lenz's Law states that the direction of induced current in a circuit opposes the change in magnetic flux that caused it. \n* **RL Circuits:**  Be familiar with the behavior of RL circuits (circuits containing inductors and resistors) and how they respond to changes in voltage.\n* **Time Constant:**  Know the definition of the time constant and its role in determining the transient response of RL circuits.\n\n**Important Note:**  The NEET exam emphasizes conceptual understanding.

    "4714": "##  Explanation:\n\nThe answer, **anticlockwise**, is correct due to Lenz's Law. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n**1. Understanding the scenario:**\n\n- A solenoid carrying current is moving towards a stationary conducting loop. \n- The solenoid acts as an electromagnet, generating a magnetic field.\n- The changing magnetic field from the moving solenoid will induce a current in the loop.\n\n**2. Applying Lenz's Law:**\n\nLenz's Law states that the induced current in a loop will always oppose the change in magnetic flux that caused it. Here's how it applies to this scenario:\n\n- **Magnetic Flux:** As the solenoid approaches the loop, the magnetic flux through the loop increases. This increase is due to the strengthening magnetic field of the solenoid as it moves closer.\n- **Opposition:** To oppose this increasing flux, the induced current in the loop will create its own magnetic field that opposes the solenoid's field.\n- **Direction:** For the induced magnetic field to oppose the solenoid's field, the current in the loop must flow in the **anticlockwise** direction. This is because, as per the right-hand rule, an anticlockwise current creates a magnetic field pointing outwards from the loop, opposing the inwards field of the approaching solenoid.\n\n**3. Relevant Formulas:**\n\nWhile the question doesn't require specific formulas for calculation, the following are relevant to the concept of electromagnetic induction:\n\n- **Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction:**  \n  \n  ```\n  \u03b5 = -d\u03a6/dt\n  ```\n  This law states that the electromotive force (\u03b5) induced in a loop is equal to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux (\u03a6) through the loop.\n\n- **Magnetic Flux:**\n  \n  ```\n  \u03a6 = B\u22c5A\n  ```\n  The magnetic flux through a loop is the product of the magnetic field strength (B) and the area (A) of the loop.\n\n**4. Learning statements for NEET exam:**\n\n- **Electromagnetic Induction:**  The phenomenon of inducing an electromotive force (EMF) in a conductor due to a changing magnetic field.\n- **Lenz's Law:**  The induced current in a loop always flows in a direction that opposes the change in magnetic flux that caused it. \n- **Right-hand Rule:**  Used to determine the direction of the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire or loop.\n- **Faraday's Law:**  Explains the quantitative relationship between the rate of change of magnetic flux and the induced EMF.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Understanding Lenz's Law and its application in various scenarios is crucial for solving questions related to electromagnetic induction.
