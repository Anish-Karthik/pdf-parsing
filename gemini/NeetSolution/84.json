Here's why:\n\n**Understanding SHM:**\n\n* **Restoring Force:** The key to SHM is a restoring force that always acts to bring the object back to its equilibrium position. This force is directly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium and acts in the opposite direction.\n* **Potential Energy:**  The restoring force does work on the object, storing potential energy as the object moves away from equilibrium.\n* **Kinetic Energy:** As the object moves back towards equilibrium, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**\n\n1. **No External Forces:** In ideal SHM, there are no external forces like friction or air resistance acting on the system.\n2. **Energy Transformation:** The only forces involved are the restoring force and the inertial force of the object's motion. Since these forces are conservative (they don't dissipate energy), the total mechanical energy (sum of potential and kinetic energy) remains constant.\n\n**Formulas:**\n\n* **Potential Energy (PE):** PE = (1/2)kx\u00b2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from equilibrium.\n* **Kinetic Energy (KE):** KE = (1/2)mv\u00b2, where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity.\n* **Total Energy (TE):** TE = PE + KE = constant\n\n**Step by Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Consider a body in SHM:**  Imagine a mass attached to a spring oscillating back and forth.\n2. **At maximum displacement:** The body has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy.\n3. **At equilibrium position:** The body has zero potential energy and maximum kinetic energy.\n4. **At any other point:** The body possesses both potential and kinetic energy, but their sum remains constant.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET:**\n\n1. **SHM is a fundamental concept in physics:** Understanding SHM is crucial for many other topics in mechanics, like oscillations, waves, and even atomic physics.\n2. **Energy conservation is a key principle:**  Knowing that energy remains constant in a closed system with conservative forces is vital for solving problems involving SHM.\n3. **Focus on the restoring force:** Remember that the restoring force is what dictates the nature of SHM, and it directly influences the energy changes within the system. \n4. **Practice applying formulas:**  Familiarize yourself with the formulas for PE, KE, and TE in SHM to solve problems effectively.\n\nBy understanding the concept of energy conservation and the interplay of potential and kinetic energy in SHM, you'll be well-equipped to tackle questions related to this crucial topic in the NEET exam. \n",

Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Moment of Inertia (I):** It measures the resistance of a body to rotational motion.

Let's break down why:\n\n**Assertion (A): In SHM velocity leads by \u03c0/2 phase from displacement.**\n\nThis statement is **true**. Here's why:\n\n* **SHM Equation:**  The displacement (x) of a particle in SHM can be represented by the equation:\n   *  x = A sin(\u03c9t + \u03c6) \n   * Where:\n      * A is the amplitude\n      * \u03c9 is the angular frequency\n      * t is time\n      * \u03c6 is the initial phase\n\n* **Velocity Equation:** The velocity (v) is the time derivative of displacement:\n   * v = dx/dt = A\u03c9 cos(\u03c9t + \u03c6)\n\n* **Phase Difference:** Notice that the velocity equation has a cosine function, while the displacement equation has a sine function.

It's **opposite to the displacement only when the object is moving away from the equilibrium position**. When the object is moving towards the equilibrium position, the force is in the same direction as the displacement.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n* The assertion (A) is true because the velocity in SHM leads the displacement by \u03c0/2 phase.\n* The reason (R) is false because the force in SHM is not always opposite to displacement; it is always directed towards the equilibrium position.\n\n## Learning Statements for NEET:\n\n* **Key concept:** Understanding the relationship between displacement, velocity, and acceleration in SHM is crucial for NEET. \n* **Phase difference:** Remember that the velocity leads the displacement by \u03c0/2 phase in SHM.\n* **Restoring Force:** Understand that the force in SHM is a restoring force and its direction is towards the equilibrium position.\n* **Hook's Law:**  SHM is often associated with systems that obey Hooke's law, which states that the restoring force is proportional to the displacement.\n* **Energy Conservation:**  SHM is a conservative force system where energy is conserved.

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM):**\n\n* **Restoring Force:** SHM is characterized by a restoring force that is directly proportional to the displacement of the particle from its equilibrium position and always acts towards that position.  \n* **Equilibrium Position:** This is the point where the net force on the particle is zero.\n* **Oscillation:** The particle oscillates back and forth around the equilibrium position.\n\n**Acceleration in SHM:**\n\n* **Acceleration is proportional to displacement:** The acceleration of the particle is directly proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position.  This means:\n    * When the particle is moving towards the equilibrium position (positive displacement), its acceleration is in the opposite direction (negative), causing it to **retard** or slow down.\n    * When the particle is moving away from the equilibrium position (negative displacement), its acceleration is in the same direction (positive), causing it to **accelerate** or speed up.\n\n**Visualizing the Process:**\n\nImagine a mass attached to a spring. \n\n1. **Stretching the spring:** When you pull the mass away from its equilibrium position, the spring exerts a restoring force that tries to bring the mass back to its equilibrium position. This force causes the mass to accelerate towards the equilibrium position, but as it gets closer, the force and acceleration decrease.\n2. **Passing equilibrium:** The mass continues to move towards the equilibrium position, but now the spring force acts in the opposite direction. This causes the mass to decelerate and eventually come to rest at the equilibrium position.\n3. **Compressing the spring:** The mass continues to move past the equilibrium position due to its inertia, compressing the spring. The spring force now acts in the opposite direction, accelerating the mass towards the equilibrium position.\n4. **Repeating the cycle:** The process repeats, with the mass alternating between acceleration and retardation as it oscillates back and forth around the equilibrium position.\n\n**Formula:**\n\nThe acceleration (a) of a particle in SHM is given by:\n\n* **a = -\u03c9\u00b2x**\n  \n  where:\n    * \u03c9 is the angular frequency of the motion\n    * x is the displacement from the equilibrium position\n\n**The negative sign indicates that the acceleration is always directed opposite to the displacement.**\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n* **Understand the definition and characteristics of SHM.**\n* **Memorize the formula for acceleration in SHM and its meaning.**\n* **Be able to identify the factors that affect the period and frequency of SHM (like mass, spring constant, etc.).**\n* **Practice solving problems involving SHM, including finding displacement, velocity, and acceleration at different points in time.**\n* **Relate SHM to real-world examples like a pendulum, a spring-mass system, and sound waves.**\n\nBy understanding the fundamental concepts of SHM and applying them to practice problems, you will be well-prepared for the NEET exam. \n",
    "4492": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the length of an equivalent simple pendulum that would have the same period of oscillation as the disc. To find this, we need to understand the concept of the \"period\" of oscillation and how it relates to the physical properties of the oscillating object.\n\n**Here's the breakdown:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Period:** \n   The period of oscillation (T) is the time taken for one complete oscillation. For a simple pendulum, it is determined by the length (L) of the pendulum and the acceleration due to gravity (g). The formula is:\n\n   **T = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g)**\n\n2. **Calculating the Moment of Inertia:**\n   The period of oscillation of the disc is determined by its moment of inertia (I) and its restoring torque. The restoring torque arises due to the force of gravity acting on the disc's center of mass. \n\n   The moment of inertia of a disc about an axis perpendicular to its plane and passing through its center is: \n   **I = (1/2)MR\u00b2** \n   Where M is the mass of the disc and R is its radius.\n\n   Since the disc oscillates about a point R/4 away from its center, we need to apply the parallel axis theorem to find the moment of inertia about this axis. The parallel axis theorem states:\n   **I' = I + Md\u00b2** \n   Where I' is the moment of inertia about the new axis, I is the moment of inertia about the center, M is the mass, and d is the distance between the two axes (R/4 in this case).\n\n   Therefore, the moment of inertia of the disc about the axis of oscillation becomes:\n   **I' = (1/2)MR\u00b2 + M(R/4)\u00b2 = (9/8)MR\u00b2**\n\n3. **Finding the Equivalent Length:** \n   The period of oscillation of the disc can be related to the period of a simple pendulum by equating their angular frequencies (\u03c9). Angular frequency is the rate of change of angular displacement and is related to the period by:\n\n   **\u03c9 = 2\u03c0/T**\n\n   For a simple pendulum, \u03c9\u00b2 = g/L, and for the oscillating disc, \u03c9\u00b2 = (mgR/4)/I'. \n   Equating the angular frequencies:\n\n   **(mgR/4)/I' = g/L** \n\n   Substituting the value of I' and simplifying, we get:\n\n   **L = (4I')/(MR) = (4 * (9/8)MR\u00b2)/(MR) = 9R/4**\n\n**Therefore, the length of the equivalent simple pendulum is 9R/4.**\n\n## Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:\n\n* **Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM):** Understanding SHM is crucial for NEET. Learn about its defining characteristics, like restoring force proportional to displacement and the periodic nature of motion.\n* **Period of Oscillation:** Know how to calculate the period of various SHM systems like simple pendulums, spring-mass systems, and physical pendulums.\n* **Moment of Inertia:**  Understand the concept of moment of inertia and its role in rotational motion.
