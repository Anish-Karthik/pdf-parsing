When an electric field is applied, they acquire a net drift velocity in the direction opposite to the electric field.\n* **Ohm's Law:** This fundamental law in electricity states that the current (I) flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across its ends and inversely proportional to its resistance (R):  **V = IR**.\n\n**Why the Electric Field Exists Inside the Wire:**\n\n1. **Free Electrons:** Conductors have free electrons that can move easily. \n2. **Voltage Applied:** When a voltage is applied across the ends of a wire, an electric field is created inside the wire. This electric field exerts a force on the free electrons, causing them to drift in a specific direction. \n3. **Current Flow:** The movement of these electrons constitutes the electric current.\n4. **Direction of Electric Field:** The direction of the electric field is from the positive terminal of the voltage source to the negative terminal, which means it's parallel to the length of the wire.\n\n**Why the Electric Field is Parallel to the Wire:**\n\n* The electric field inside the wire is created by the potential difference across the wire.\n* This potential difference acts along the length of the wire, causing the electrons to move along that same direction. \n* Therefore, the electric field must also be parallel to the length of the wire to exert a force on the electrons and cause them to move in that direction.\n\n**Relevant Formula:**\n\n* **Electric Field (E) = V/d** where V is the potential difference and d is the distance between the two points.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:**\n\n* **Understanding the Relationship:**  An electric field is essential for the flow of electric current.

    "4638": "The answer \"Parabolic\" is **incorrect**. The path of free electrons between two successive collisions in a current-carrying conductor is **not parabolic**. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Motion of Free Electrons**\n\n* **Random Motion:**  Free electrons in a conductor are in constant random motion due to thermal energy. They collide with the positive ions of the metal lattice, changing direction and speed with each collision.\n* **Drift Velocity:** When an electric field is applied across the conductor, the electrons experience a force and begin to drift in a direction opposite to the field. This drift is superimposed on their random motion.\n* **Collision Dominance:** The collisions with the ions are much more frequent than the acceleration due to the electric field. This means the electrons don't travel in a straight line, but rather take a **zigzag path**. \n\n**Why not Parabolic?**\n\nParabolic paths are associated with constant acceleration in one direction (like projectiles in a gravitational field). The electrons in a conductor experience:\n\n* **Random Accelerations:**  Each collision with an ion changes the electron's velocity randomly. \n* **Electric Field:** The electric field provides a constant force, but the collisions interrupt the acceleration, preventing a consistent parabolic path.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation**\n\n* **Drift velocity:** The average velocity of the electrons in a conductor under the influence of an electric field. It's much smaller than the random thermal velocities.\n* **Collision time:** The average time between collisions of free electrons with the lattice ions.

Here's why:\n\n**Assertion: Electric field outside the conducting wire which carries a constant current is zero.**\n\nThis statement is true. When a constant current flows through a conducting wire, the electric field outside the wire is effectively zero. This is because:\n\n* **Charge Distribution:**  While electrons are moving within the conductor, the net charge density on the wire remains zero. This is due to the balance between the free electrons moving with the current and the positive charges of the atomic lattice. \n* **Electrostatic Equilibrium:** The electric field inside the conductor is also zero, as any net electric field would cause the free charges to redistribute until the field is nullified. This is a state of electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n**Reason: Net charge on conducting current carrying wire is zero.**\n\nThis statement is also true. As explained above, the conducting wire maintains charge neutrality. The movement of electrons constitutes the current, but they are balanced by the positive charges of the atomic lattice.\n\n**Why Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion:**\n\nThe reason directly explains the assertion. Since the net charge on the wire is zero, there is no net electric field outside the wire. This is because the electric field is directly proportional to the charge creating it.\n\n**Relevant Formulas:**\n\n* **Electric Field due to a Point Charge:**  E = kQ/r\u00b2 \n   * Where E is the electric field, k is Coulomb's constant, Q is the charge, and r is the distance from the charge.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach (Not Applicable here):**\n\nThis question doesn't involve direct calculation. It focuses on understanding the concepts of charge distribution and electrostatic equilibrium in current-carrying conductors.\n\n## Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:\n\n* **Charge Neutrality:**  A good conductor generally maintains charge neutrality. Even when carrying a current, the movement of free electrons is balanced by the fixed positive charges of the atomic lattice.\n* **Electrostatic Equilibrium:**  A conductor in electrostatic equilibrium has no net electric field inside it. This is because any electric field would cause free charges to move until the field is nullified.\n* **Electric Field and Charge:**  The electric field is directly proportional to the charge creating it. This means a zero net charge leads to a zero net electric field.\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* The above explanation applies to steady-state currents (constant current) and ideal conductors.\n* In real-world scenarios, there might be slight deviations due to factors like resistance and non-uniform current distribution. However, the fundamental principles remain the same. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Drift Velocity:**\n\n* **Drift Velocity:**  Electrons in a conductor are in constant random motion. When an electric field is applied (due to a potential difference), the electrons gain a net directional velocity called drift velocity. This velocity is much smaller than their random thermal velocities. \n* **Drift velocity is directly proportional to the electric field:**  A stronger electric field means a greater force on the electrons, causing them to accelerate and drift faster.\n\n**The Relationship to Potential Difference:**\n\n* **Electric Field and Potential Difference:** Electric field (E) is related to potential difference (V) and the length of the conductor (L) by the equation: E = V/L\n* **Drift Velocity and Electric Field:**  Drift velocity (vd) is directly proportional to the electric field: vd = \u03bcE, where \u03bc is the mobility of the electrons.\n\n**Putting it Together:**\n\n1. **Double the potential difference:**  If you double the potential difference (V), you double the electric field (E) across the wire (since E = V/L).\n2. **Double the drift velocity:** Since drift velocity is directly proportional to the electric field, doubling the electric field will also double the drift velocity (vd = \u03bcE).\n\n**Therefore, doubling the potential difference across the wire will double the drift velocity of the electrons.**\n\n**Relevant Formulas:**\n\n* Electric Field: E = V/L\n* Drift Velocity: vd = \u03bcE\n* Current Density: J = nev<sub>d</sub> (where n is the number density of electrons, e is the charge of an electron)\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:**\n\n* **Current Electricity is a fundamental concept in physics:**  Understand the relationship between potential difference, electric field, current, and drift velocity.\n* **Drift Velocity is crucial:** It plays a significant role in understanding how current flows through a conductor.\n* **Ohm's Law is essential:** It relates voltage, current, and resistance, which are key concepts in solving problems related to current electricity.\n* **Resistivity and Conductivity:**  These properties are crucial for understanding how different materials conduct electricity.\n* **Practice problem-solving:**  Working through numerical problems will solidify your understanding of the concepts.\n\nBy focusing on these concepts and practicing problem-solving, you'll be well-prepared to tackle questions on current electricity in the NEET exam. \n",

The proportionality arises from the fact that the **force exerted on an electron** by the electric field is directly proportional to the field strength (F = qE, where q is the charge of the electron).

It's measured in amperes (A).  In a conductor, this flow is due to the movement of free electrons.\n* **Drift Velocity:**  The average velocity of the free electrons in a conductor under the influence of an electric field is called drift velocity (v<sub>d</sub>).\n* **Current Density:** Current density (J) is the current per unit cross-sectional area (A).

Current is a scalar quantity, and it represents the total flow of charge.  The same amount of charge must pass through any cross-section of the wire in a given time, regardless of the area. \n* **Reason:** The current in a wire is due to drift of electrons along the wire.\n    * This is **TRUE** but **NOT a correct explanation** of the assertion. While drift of electrons is the mechanism behind current, it doesn't directly explain why current remains constant in a non-uniform wire.\n\n**Why the Reason Doesn't Explain the Assertion**\n\nThe reason focuses on the mechanism of current flow, but it doesn't consider the following:\n\n* **Conservation of Charge:** The most important principle at play here is the conservation of charge. Charge cannot be created or destroyed, so the same amount of charge must pass through any point in a circuit.\n* **Drift Velocity and Cross-Section:**  In a non-uniform wire, the drift velocity of electrons will change depending on the cross-sectional area.  Where the area is smaller, the drift velocity will be higher to maintain the same current.\n\n**Explanation of the Assertion**\n\nThink of a pipe with water flowing through it.  If the pipe narrows, the water must flow faster to maintain the same volume flow rate. Similarly, in a non-uniform wire, the electrons must move faster in the narrower sections to ensure the same amount of charge passes through every point in the wire.\n\n**Formulas**\n\n* **Current (I) = Charge (Q) / Time (t)**\n* **Current Density (J) = I / A** (where A is the cross-sectional area)\n* **J = ne v<sub>d</sub>**\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam**\n\n* Understand the difference between current and current density.\n* Be able to apply the concept of conservation of charge in electrical circuits.\n* Know the relationship between drift velocity, current density, and cross-sectional area.\n* Remember that the current is the same at every point in a circuit, even if the wire has non-uniform cross-section. \n* Be prepared to analyze circuits with varying cross-sections and explain how current and drift velocity change.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  The assertion highlights the fundamental principle of conservation of charge in circuits, while the reason explains the mechanism of current flow.

If the pipe widens, the water flow slows down even though the same amount of water is flowing through the pipe.

Here's the explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Relationship:**\n\n* **Resistance (R) is directly proportional to the length (L) of the wire.** This means if the length increases, the resistance also increases proportionally. The formula is: R = \u03c1L/A, where \u03c1 is the resistivity, L is the length, and A is the cross-sectional area.\n* **Resistance (R) is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area (A) of the wire.** This means if the area increases, the resistance decreases.\n\n**The Effect of Stretching:**\n\n1. **Length Increase:** When the wire is stretched, its length increases by 1%. This directly translates to a 1% increase in resistance (as R is directly proportional to L).\n2. **Area Decrease:**  The stretching also causes the wire's cross-sectional area to decrease. Since the volume of the wire remains constant, the decrease in area is inversely proportional to the increase in length. In this case, the area decreases by approximately 1%.\n3. **Combined Effect:** The increase in resistance due to the length increase is countered by a decrease in resistance due to the area decrease. However, the increase in length has a stronger effect because resistance is directly proportional to length, while inversely proportional to the area. Therefore, the net change in resistance is an increase.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSince the change in area is relatively small, we can approximate the change in resistance as:\n\n* **Change in Resistance \u2248 (Change in Length) + (Change in Area)**\n* **Change in Resistance \u2248 1% + (-1%) \u2248 2%**\n\n**Therefore, the resistance of the wire increases by approximately 2%.**\n\n**Relevant Formula:**\n\n* **R = \u03c1L/A**, where:\n    * R = Resistance\n    * \u03c1 = Resistivity (a material property)\n    * L = Length of the wire\n    * A = Cross-sectional area of the wire\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET:**\n\n* **Direct and Inverse Proportions:**  Understand the relationships between resistance, length, and area of a conductor.

    "4654": "You are absolutely right! The answer is **All of these**. Here's why:\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWhen a resistor is heated due to the current flowing through it, several quantities change:\n\n1. **Resistance (R):**  The most direct effect of heating is an increase in resistance.  This is because the increased temperature causes the atoms in the resistor to vibrate more, making it harder for electrons to flow through. This relationship between temperature and resistance is described by the temperature coefficient of resistance (\u03b1):\n\n   * **R = R\u2080(1 + \u03b1\u0394T)** \n     * R = Resistance at the higher temperature\n     * R\u2080 = Resistance at the initial temperature\n     * \u03b1 = Temperature coefficient of resistance\n     * \u0394T = Change in temperature\n\n2. **Current (I):**  As resistance increases, the current flowing through the resistor decreases. This is governed by Ohm's Law:\n\n   * **V = IR**\n     * V = Voltage across the resistor\n     * I = Current flowing through the resistor\n     * R = Resistance of the resistor\n\n   Since the voltage (supplied by the battery) is generally constant, an increase in resistance directly leads to a decrease in current.\n\n3. **Power (P):**  Power dissipated by the resistor is also affected. It is calculated using:\n\n   * **P = I\u00b2R = V\u00b2/R**\n\n   Although current decreases, the increase in resistance can lead to a net increase in power dissipation. The exact effect on power depends on the specific values of voltage, current, and resistance.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n* **Understanding the relationship between temperature and resistance is crucial.**  Resistors are not always ideal; their resistance can vary with temperature, which is especially important in circuits with varying operating conditions.\n* **Ohm's Law is a fundamental concept.** It allows you to analyze and predict the behavior of circuits by relating voltage, current, and resistance.\n* **Power dissipation in resistors is essential for circuit design.**  Knowing how power changes with temperature helps ensure components don't overheat and fail.\n* **Understanding the temperature coefficient of resistance allows you to quantify how resistance changes with temperature.**  This is critical for understanding the behavior of devices at different temperatures.\n\n**In summary:** Heating a resistor significantly impacts its resistance, current, and power dissipation.

    "4677": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nYou are absolutely correct! The answer, \"Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is correct explanation of Assertion,\" is the correct interpretation of the given statement. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Assertion and Reason:**\n\n* **Assertion:** \"Negative of slope of terminal voltage versus discharge current graph represents internal resistance of cell.\"\n* **Reason:** \"During discharging of battery the terminal voltage of battery is V = E \u2013 Ir\"\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Terminal Voltage and Internal Resistance:** When a battery discharges, its terminal voltage (V) is lower than its electromotive force (E), the potential difference it can theoretically provide. This difference is due to the internal resistance (r) of the battery, which opposes the flow of current. \n\n2. **Equation for Terminal Voltage:** The reason provides the equation V = E \u2013 Ir, which accurately describes this relationship. \n\n    * V = Terminal voltage \n    * E = Electromotive force (EMF)\n    * I = Discharge current\n    * r = Internal resistance\n\n3. **Slope of the Graph:**  A graph of terminal voltage (V) against discharge current (I) will have a negative slope. This is because as the discharge current increases, the voltage drop across the internal resistance (Ir) increases, leading to a decrease in terminal voltage.\n\n4. **Negative of the Slope:** The negative slope of this graph is precisely equal to the internal resistance (r) of the cell. This is because the equation V = E \u2013 Ir can be rewritten as:\n    \n    V = -Ir + E\n    \n    This equation represents a straight line with a slope of -r.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assertion and the reason are both correct, and the reason provides a direct explanation for the assertion. The negative slope of the terminal voltage versus discharge current graph indeed represents the internal resistance of the cell.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:**\n\n* **Internal Resistance is a key concept:** Internal resistance is an important factor that affects the performance of batteries and other electrical devices. Understanding how it works is crucial for analyzing circuits and predicting device behavior.\n* **Terminal Voltage is not always equal to EMF:**  A key point to remember is that the terminal voltage of a battery is not always equal to its EMF. The internal resistance plays a role in reducing the terminal voltage, particularly under load.\n* **Understanding Graphs:**  Being able to interpret graphs is essential for understanding various concepts in physics. Practice identifying slopes, intercepts, and their relationships to physical quantities. \n* **Formula Application:**  Memorizing relevant formulas and applying them to different situations is crucial for solving numerical problems in NEET.\n* **Battery Characteristics:** Learn about different types of batteries, their characteristics, and how they work. \n\nBy focusing on these points and practicing numerous problems, you can effectively prepare for the NEET exam and strengthen your understanding of Current Electricity. \n",
    "4678": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nYou are absolutely right! The answer to the question \"To draw maximum current from a combination of cells, how should the cells be grouped?\" depends entirely on the relationship between the **external resistance (R)** of the circuit and the **internal resistance (r)** of each cell. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Internal Resistance (r):** Every cell, even an ideal one, has some internal resistance. This resistance opposes the flow of current within the cell itself. \n* **External Resistance (R):** This is the resistance of the circuit outside the cells, which the current flows through.\n* **Current (I):** The amount of charge flowing per unit time.\n\n**The Key Formula:**\n\nThe current drawn from a circuit with a combination of cells is governed by **Ohm's Law** and the concept of **equivalent internal resistance**. Let's break down the formula:\n\n1. **Total EMF (E):** The total electromotive force (voltage) provided by the cells in the combination.\n2. **Equivalent Internal Resistance (r'):** This is the combined internal resistance of all cells in the combination. Its value depends on how the cells are connected:\n    * **Series:**  r' = r\u2081 + r\u2082 + ... + r\u2099 (where r\u2081 , r\u2082 ... r\u2099 are the internal resistances of individual cells)\n    * **Parallel:** 1/r' = 1/r\u2081 + 1/r\u2082 + ... + 1/r\u2099 \n3. **Total Resistance (R'):** This is the sum of external resistance (R) and equivalent internal resistance (r'): R' = R + r'\n\n**Applying Ohm's Law:**\n\nThe current (I) in the circuit is calculated using Ohm's Law:\n\n**I = E / R'  = E / (R + r')**\n\n**Maximizing Current:**\n\nTo draw maximum current, we need to minimize the denominator (R + r'). This is where the relationship between R and r' comes into play:\n\n* **If R >> r':**  In this case, the external resistance is much larger than the internal resistance. The denominator is dominated by R. To maximize current, we need to minimize the effect of r'. **Connecting cells in parallel** minimizes r' as shown in the formula above.\n* **If R << r':** In this case, the external resistance is much smaller than the internal resistance.  The denominator is dominated by r'. To maximize current, we need to minimize r'. **Connecting cells in series** will increase the total EMF (E) proportionally, but it will also increase the internal resistance (r'). However, since the external resistance is very small, the change in internal resistance will have a smaller impact on the total resistance (R'). This will lead to a higher current.\n* **If R \u2248 r':** In this case, both external and internal resistances are comparable.  **A combination of series and parallel connections** might be necessary to achieve the maximum current. This requires careful analysis of the specific values of R and r to determine the optimal configuration.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n1. **Internal resistance is an important factor in determining the current flow in a circuit.** It is not just the EMF of the cells that matters, but also how their internal resistance affects the total resistance of the circuit.\n2. **The optimal connection of cells depends on the relative values of external and internal resistance.**  This understanding allows for optimizing circuit design to maximize current flow.\n3. **Understanding the concepts of series and parallel combinations of cells is crucial.** This knowledge is essential for calculating the equivalent EMF and internal resistance of the combination.\n4. **Ohm's Law is fundamental to analyzing electrical circuits.** It forms the basis for calculating current, voltage, and resistance in various configurations of cells. \n5. **Practice various numerical problems related to series and parallel connections of cells.** This will help in solidifying the understanding of these concepts and their application in different scenarios.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing problems, you will be well-prepared to tackle questions related to current electricity on the NEET exam. \n",
    "4679": "##  Converting a Galvanometer to a Voltmeter\n\nYou are absolutely right! A galvanometer can be converted into a voltmeter by connecting a **high resistance in series** with it. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Basics**\n\n* **Galvanometer:** A galvanometer is a sensitive device that detects and measures small electric currents. It deflects its needle proportionally to the current flowing through it.\n* **Voltmeter:** A voltmeter measures the potential difference (voltage) across two points in a circuit.  \n\n**Why a High Resistance in Series?**\n\n1. **Voltmeter Function:** A voltmeter needs to be connected in parallel across the component whose voltage is being measured. This means it should draw a very small current from the circuit to avoid significantly altering the voltage being measured.\n2. **Galvanometer Limitation:** A galvanometer is designed to measure very small currents. If connected directly across a voltage source, it would likely be damaged by the large current flowing through it.\n3. **High Resistance Solution:** By connecting a high resistance in series with the galvanometer, we create a voltage divider.  The high resistance limits the current flowing through the galvanometer, ensuring it operates within its safe range. \n\n**The Formula:**\n\nLet's consider:\n*  `R` = resistance of the galvanometer\n*  `S` = resistance connected in series\n*  `I_g` = full-scale deflection current of the galvanometer\n*  `V_g` = voltage across the galvanometer at full-scale deflection \n\nThe voltage across the galvanometer (`V_g`) is given by:\n\n```\nV_g = I_g * (R + S)\n```\n\nSince the series resistance `S` is much larger than the galvanometer resistance `R`, the voltage across the galvanometer is almost equal to the voltage being measured.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Know the galvanometer's full-scale deflection current (I_g) and voltage (V_g).**\n2. **Determine the desired full-scale voltage (V) of the voltmeter.**\n3. **Calculate the required series resistance (S) using the formula:**\n\n   ```\n   S = (V/I_g) - R \n   ```\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET:**\n\n* **Current Electricity is a fundamental topic in physics and essential for NEET preparation.**\n* **Understanding the working principles of galvanometers and voltmeters is crucial for solving problems related to circuits and measurements.**\n* **Knowing how to convert a galvanometer into a voltmeter using a series resistance is a valuable skill for NEET exam preparation.**\n* **Pay attention to the concepts of voltage, current, resistance, and their relationships in circuits.**\n* **Practice solving numerical problems based on these concepts to enhance your understanding and application skills.**\n\n**Remember:**  This explanation highlights the core concept behind converting a galvanometer to a voltmeter.

    "4680": "##  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"Ammeter is placed in parallel across the conductor in a circuit\" is **incorrect**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Ammeters measure current.** Current is the flow of charge through a conductor.  To measure the current flowing through a specific part of a circuit, the ammeter must be connected in **series** with that part. \n* **Series connection:** In a series connection, the same current flows through all components. By placing the ammeter in series, it experiences the same current as the conductor, allowing it to accurately measure the current.\n* **Parallel connection:** In a parallel connection, the current divides between the different branches. If an ammeter is placed in parallel, it would measure the total current flowing through the branch containing the ammeter, not just the current through the conductor of interest.\n\n**Therefore, an ammeter is always connected in series to measure the current flowing through a specific part of a circuit.**\n\n## Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:\n\n1. **Understanding Ammeters and Voltmeters:**  Be clear on the difference between an ammeter and a voltmeter.
