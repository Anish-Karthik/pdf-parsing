When light passes through two narrow slits, it creates an interference pattern on a screen, characterized by alternating bright and dark fringes.\n* **Fringe Width:** The distance between two consecutive bright or dark fringes is called the fringe width.\n* **Wavelength:** The wavelength of light is the distance between two consecutive crests or troughs of a wave.\n* **Refractive Index:**  The refractive index of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in that medium.

In Young's experiment, light waves from two pinholes (slits) interfere to produce bright and dark fringes on a screen.  For interference to occur, the following conditions must be met:\n\n* **Coherent Sources:** The light waves must be coherent, meaning they must have the same frequency and a constant phase difference.\n* **Same Wavelength:** The light waves must have the same wavelength to produce a stable interference pattern. \n\n**The Problem with Filters:**\n\n* **Blue and Yellow Filters:** A blue filter allows only blue light to pass through, while a yellow filter allows only yellow light. Blue and yellow light have different wavelengths. \n* **Incoherent Sources:**  The light passing through the two filters will have different wavelengths.  Therefore, the light waves will not be coherent. \n* **No Stable Pattern:** Since the waves are incoherent and have different wavelengths, they will not interfere constructively or destructively in a predictable way. This will lead to a lack of a visible interference pattern.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nFilters change the wavelengths of light passing through them.

    "4872": "## Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe answer, **\u03bbD/d**, represents the **fringe width** in a Young's double-slit experiment, which is the distance between two consecutive maxima or minima on the interference pattern. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n**1. Young's Double-Slit Experiment:**\n\nIn this experiment, two pinholes (slits) are illuminated by a single source of light. The light waves passing through these slits interfere with each other, creating an interference pattern on a screen placed behind the slits. This pattern consists of alternating bright and dark bands called **maxima** and **minima**, respectively.\n\n**2. Path Difference and Interference:**\n\nThe interference pattern arises due to the **path difference** between the light waves reaching a point on the screen from the two slits. At points where the path difference is an integral multiple of the wavelength (\u03bb), the waves interfere constructively, leading to a bright fringe (maxima). At points where the path difference is an odd multiple of half the wavelength, the waves interfere destructively, resulting in a dark fringe (minima).\n\n**3. Derivation of Fringe Width:**\n\nConsider two slits S1 and S2 separated by a distance 'd' and a screen at a distance 'D' from the slits. Let P be a point on the screen where a bright fringe is observed.\n\n- The path difference between the waves reaching P from S1 and S2 is S2P - S1P.\n- Using geometry, we can show that for a bright fringe, this path difference is equal to n\u03bb, where 'n' is an integer representing the order of the fringe (n = 0 for central maxima, n = 1 for first order maxima, and so on).\n- Applying the geometry of similar triangles and the small angle approximation (tan \u03b8 \u2248 sin \u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8), we can derive the relation:\n\n   **Path difference = d sin \u03b8 = n\u03bb**\n\n- Since \u03b8 is small, we can also approximate sin \u03b8 \u2248 y/D, where 'y' is the distance of the fringe from the central maximum.\n- Substituting this in the above equation, we get:\n\n   **y = n\u03bbD/d**\n\n- This equation represents the position of the nth order bright fringe. The fringe width (\u03b2) is the distance between two consecutive maxima (n = 0 and n = 1). Hence, the fringe width is:\n\n   **\u03b2 = \u03bbD/d**\n\n**Therefore, the spacing between successive maxima or minima in an interference experiment is \u03bbD/d.**\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n1.

This means the crests and troughs of the waves align consistently, allowing them to interfere constructively (bright spots) or destructively (dark spots) to create the characteristic interference pattern.\n\n**Intensity** determines the brightness of the interference pattern, but it doesn't dictate whether it's visible or not. A brighter pattern will be easier to observe, but a fainter pattern can still be detected if the difference in intensity between the sources isn't too extreme.\n\n**Relevant Formulas:**\n\nWhile specific formulas for calculating the intensity of interference patterns are used in more advanced physics, the core concept relates to the superposition of waves. The resultant amplitude of the two interfering waves depends on their individual amplitudes (related to intensity) and their phase difference.\n\n**Learning Statements:**\n\n* **Interference patterns occur due to the superposition of coherent waves.**\n* **Coherence is crucial for observing interference patterns.**\n* **The intensity of light sources affects the brightness of the interference pattern but not its existence.**\n* **Equal intensity of light sources is not a necessary condition for observing interference patterns.**\n* **For NEET exam, you should understand the basics of interference, including coherence, path difference, and intensity.**\n\n**In summary:**  While equal intensity might make observing an interference pattern easier, it's not a requirement.

When light passes through two narrow slits, it creates an interference pattern on a screen behind the slits. This pattern consists of alternating bright and dark fringes. \n* **Interference:**  Interference occurs when two waves interact with each other.

This means the crests and troughs of the waves must align consistently.\n* **Independent Light Sources:** Two sodium lamps emit light independently. They don't have a shared origin or a synchronized mechanism to maintain a fixed phase difference between their light waves.\n* **Incoherent Light:**  The light from the two lamps is incoherent, meaning their phase relationship constantly changes randomly.

    "4887": "## Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe answer, **non-uniform width and non-uniform intensity**, is correct because of the way diffraction patterns are formed. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n**Diffraction:** \n\nDiffraction is the phenomenon where light waves bend around obstacles or spread out after passing through narrow openings. This bending and spreading cause interference patterns \u2013 regions of constructive and destructive interference, resulting in bright and dark fringes.\n\n**Slit Diffraction:**\n\nIn a single slit experiment, light passing through a narrow slit produces a diffraction pattern on a screen behind the slit. This pattern consists of a central bright fringe (maximum) flanked by alternating dark and bright fringes (minima and maxima).\n\n**Non-uniform Width:**\n\nThe width of the fringes is not uniform. The central bright fringe is the widest, and the width of subsequent fringes decreases as you move away from the center. This is because the path difference between the light waves from different parts of the slit increases as you move away from the center.  \n\n**Non-uniform Intensity:**\n\nThe intensity of the fringes is also not uniform. The central bright fringe is the brightest, and the intensity of subsequent fringes decreases rapidly. This is because the path difference between the light waves from different parts of the slit causes constructive and destructive interference. The central maximum corresponds to all waves interfering constructively, while the intensity decreases due to increasing destructive interference in subsequent fringes.\n\n**Formulas:**\n\nThe width of the central maximum in single-slit diffraction is given by:\n\n* **w = 2\u03bbD/d** \n    * Where:\n        * w = width of the central maximum\n        * \u03bb = wavelength of light\n        * D = distance between the slit and the screen\n        * d = width of the slit\n\nThe angular position of the minima (dark fringes) is given by:\n\n* **sin\u03b8 = m\u03bb/d**\n    * Where:\n        * \u03b8 = angle of the minima from the central maximum\n        * m = order of the minima (1, 2, 3, ...)\n        * \u03bb = wavelength of light\n        * d = width of the slit\n\n**Learning Statements:**\n\n1. **Understanding Diffraction:** Diffraction is a fundamental phenomenon in wave optics that demonstrates the wave nature of light.

This pattern can be analyzed to determine the wavelength of light and the width of the slit.\n3. **Interference and Diffraction:** Interference and diffraction are closely related phenomena.

    "4888": "## Why the central fringe in a single-slit diffraction pattern is of maximum intensity:\n\nThe central fringe in a single-slit diffraction pattern is indeed the brightest due to the principle of **constructive interference**. Here's a breakdown of the explanation:\n\n**Understanding Diffraction:**\n\nDiffraction occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or opening comparable in size to its wavelength. This causes the wave to spread out, deviating from its original path. In a single-slit experiment, light passing through the slit diffracts, creating an interference pattern on a screen behind it.\n\n**Path Difference and Interference:**\n\n* **Central Fringe:** All the light waves from different points across the slit travel the same distance to reach the center of the screen. This means there is **zero path difference** between them.\n* **Other Fringes:** For points on the screen further from the center, light waves from different parts of the slit will have different path lengths.  This path difference creates **phase differences** between the waves.\n\n**Constructive Interference:**\n\nWhen waves with zero or equal phase difference meet, they interfere **constructively**, resulting in a higher amplitude and therefore brighter intensity. Since the central fringe has zero path difference, all the waves interfere constructively, leading to the highest intensity.\n\n**Destructive Interference:**\n\nIn contrast, for other fringes where path differences exist, some waves interfere constructively, and others destructively. The net effect is a reduction in intensity compared to the central fringe.\n\n**Formulas (not required for this question, but relevant to the topic):**\n\n* **Path Difference:**  \u0394x = d sin \u03b8 (where 'd' is the slit width, '\u03b8' is the angle from the central fringe)\n* **Condition for Maxima (constructive interference):**  \u0394x = n\u03bb (where 'n' is an integer, '\u03bb' is the wavelength of light)\n* **Condition for Minima (destructive interference):**  \u0394x = (n + 1/2)\u03bb\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:**\n\n1. **Diffraction:** Understand the phenomenon of diffraction and how it differs from reflection and refraction.\n2. **Interference:** Recognize the concepts of constructive and destructive interference and their role in forming diffraction patterns.\n3. **Single-Slit Diffraction:** Learn how a single slit produces a diffraction pattern with a bright central maximum and dimmer secondary maxima.\n4. **Path Difference:** Understand how path difference between waves leads to phase differences and affects interference.\n5. **Relationship between Wavelength and Diffraction Pattern:**  Be aware that smaller wavelengths lead to narrower diffraction patterns.\n\n**Note:** The above explanation provides a conceptual understanding of why the central fringe is the brightest. A more detailed analysis involves integrating the contributions from all points across the slit, which leads to the intensity pattern described by the Fraunhofer diffraction formula. \n",
    "4889": "## Why the central fringe is double the width of other fringes in a single slit diffraction pattern:\n\nThe central fringe in a single slit diffraction pattern is indeed **double the width** of the other fringes. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Diffraction Pattern**\n\nWhen light passes through a single slit, it diffracts, spreading out and creating an interference pattern on a screen behind the slit. This pattern consists of bright and dark fringes, known as maxima and minima, respectively.\n\n**The Central Maximum**\n\nThe central maximum (bright fringe) is located directly opposite the slit and is the brightest and widest fringe in the pattern. This is because all the waves passing through the slit contribute constructively at the center, resulting in maximum intensity.\n\n**Other Maxima**\n\nThe other maxima are located at positions where the path difference between waves from different parts of the slit is an integral multiple of the wavelength (\u03bb). However, these maxima are less bright and narrower than the central maximum.\n\n**Explanation for the Double Width**\n\nThe width of each fringe is determined by the distance between two adjacent minima (dark fringes). This distance is related to the slit width (a) and the wavelength of light (\u03bb) by the following formula:\n\n```\nsin \u03b8 = m\u03bb / a\n```\n\nwhere:\n* \u03b8 is the angle from the center of the slit to the mth minimum\n* m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum, m = 2 for the second minimum, etc.)\n\nFor the central maximum, m = 0. This means the angle \u03b8 = 0, implying that the central maximum extends from the first minimum on one side to the first minimum on the other side. \n\nFor the other maxima, m \u2265 1. Therefore, the angle \u03b8 is non-zero, and the width of these fringes is determined by the distance between two adjacent minima, which is smaller than the distance between the first minima on either side of the central maximum.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince the central maximum extends from the first minimum on one side to the first minimum on the other side, its width is double the distance between two adjacent minima, which is the width of the other fringes.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Understand the concept of diffraction and the formation of interference patterns.**\n2. **Recognize that the central maximum is the widest and brightest fringe.**\n3. **Apply the formula for the position of minima to find the angular width of the other fringes.**\n4. **Compare the angular width of the central maximum (m = 0) to the other fringes (m \u2265 1) to conclude that the central maximum is twice as wide.**\n\n**Formulas:**\n\n* **Position of minima:** sin \u03b8 = m\u03bb / a\n* **Width of fringes:** Distance between adjacent minima\n\n**Learning Statements:**\n\n* **Diffraction of light:** The phenomenon of bending of light waves around obstacles or through narrow openings.\n* **Single slit diffraction:** Diffraction pattern formed when light passes through a single narrow slit.\n* **Central maximum:** The brightest and widest fringe in the diffraction pattern.\n* **Width of fringes:** The distance between two adjacent minima.\n* **Relationship between slit width, wavelength, and fringe width:** The width of the fringes is inversely proportional to the slit width and directly proportional to the wavelength.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and applying the formulas, students can effectively prepare for NEET questions related to wave optics and diffraction. \n",

This bending causes the light to spread out and create patterns of light and dark bands called diffraction patterns.  \n\n    * **Explanation:**  Imagine a wave on a water surface encountering a barrier with a small opening. The wave will pass through the opening, but it will also spread out in all directions. This is due to the wave nature of water. Similarly, light waves diffract through narrow openings, producing patterns that are consistent with their wave nature.\n\n* **Interference:** Interference occurs when two or more waves meet and combine.

The statement \"Refractive index of material is equal to tangent of polarizing angle\" is a direct consequence of **Brewster's Law**. \n\n**Here's a detailed explanation:**\n\n* **Polarizing Angle (\u03b8p):** This is the specific angle of incidence for which light reflected from a surface is completely polarized (i.e., all the reflected light waves oscillate in the same plane). \n* **Brewster's Law:**  This law states that the tangent of the polarizing angle (\u03b8p) is equal to the refractive index (n) of the medium. Mathematically:\n\n**tan \u03b8p = n**\n\n**Why is this true?**\n\nWhen light strikes a surface, it gets partially reflected and partially refracted. The reflected light is partially polarized, meaning the electric field vibrations are not completely aligned in one direction. However, at a specific angle of incidence, the reflected light becomes completely polarized. \n\nThis happens because at the polarizing angle, the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular to each other. At this point, the reflected light is polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence (the plane containing the incident ray and the normal to the surface).\n\n**Step-by-step approach to understanding:**\n\n1. **Understanding Polarization:** Light is a transverse wave, meaning its electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Unpolarized light has vibrations in all directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Polarized light has vibrations restricted to a single plane.\n2. **Polarizing angle:** The polarizing angle is the specific angle of incidence where reflected light is completely polarized.\n3. **Brewster's Law:** This law states that the tangent of the polarizing angle is equal to the refractive index of the medium. This means that if you know the polarizing angle, you can calculate the refractive index of the material.\n\n**Relevant Formulas:**\n\n* **Brewster's Law:** tan \u03b8p = n\n* **Refractive Index:** n = c/v (where c is the speed of light in vacuum and v is the speed of light in the medium)\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET preparation:**\n\n* **Wave Optics:** This branch of physics deals with the wave nature of light and includes topics like interference, diffraction, polarization, and Huygens' principle. Understanding wave optics is crucial for NEET preparation.\n* **Polarization:** The process of restricting the vibrations of light to a single plane is known as polarization. It can be achieved by reflection, scattering, or using polarizing filters. \n* **Brewster's Law:** This law provides a relationship between the polarizing angle and the refractive index of a medium. Understanding this law is vital for solving problems related to polarization.\n* **Applications of Polarization:** Polarized sunglasses reduce glare by blocking horizontally polarized light reflected from surfaces.  Polarizers are also used in liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and in photography.\n\nBy understanding these key concepts, you will be well-equipped to tackle questions related to Wave Optics in the NEET exam.  \n",

    "4900": "## Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe answer to the question is indeed **9I and I**. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nWhen two coherent light beams interfere, the resulting intensity at a point depends on the phase difference between the waves at that point. This phenomenon is known as **interference**. \n\n**Key Formula:**\n\nThe intensity of the resultant wave due to the superposition of two waves is given by:\n\n**I_resultant = I_1 + I_2 + 2\u221a(I_1 * I_2) * cos(\u03a6)**\n\nWhere:\n\n* I_1 and I_2 are the intensities of the individual waves\n* \u03a6 is the phase difference between the waves\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Maximum Intensity:**\n\n   The maximum intensity occurs when the two waves are in phase (\u03a6 = 0). In this case, the formula simplifies to:\n\n   I_max = I_1 + I_2 + 2\u221a(I_1 * I_2) \n\n   Substituting I_1 = I and I_2 = 4I, we get:\n\n   I_max = I + 4I + 2\u221a(I * 4I) = 9I\n\n2. **Minimum Intensity:**\n\n   The minimum intensity occurs when the two waves are out of phase (\u03a6 = \u03c0). In this case, the formula simplifies to:\n\n   I_min = I_1 + I_2 - 2\u221a(I_1 * I_2)\n\n   Substituting I_1 = I and I_2 = 4I, we get:\n\n   I_min = I + 4I - 2\u221a(I * 4I) = I\n\n**Therefore, the maximum and minimum possible intensities in the resulting beam are 9I and I.**\n\n## Learning Statements for NEET Exam Preparation:\n\nHere are some important learning points related to 'Wave Optics' and the given question:\n\n* **Coherent Sources:**  Two sources of light are said to be coherent if they emit waves with a constant phase difference.
