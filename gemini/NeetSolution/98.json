This is because the equation relating KE to momentum involves the square of momentum, negating the effect of the negative sign in the positron's momentum. \n\n**Therefore, since both particles have the same momentum, their de Broglie wavelengths are equal, resulting in a ratio of 1:1.**\n\n## Learning Statements for NEET:\n\n* **De Broglie's Hypothesis:**  All matter exhibits wave-like properties, and the wavelength is inversely proportional to the momentum.\n* **Dual Nature of Matter:**  Particles can behave as both waves and particles.\n* **Photoelectric Effect:** The ejection of electrons from a metal surface when light shines on it.

Its momentum is p = mv, and its initial kinetic energy is KE = (mv^2)/2.\n\n2. **Changes:** The load is changed, doubling both the velocity (2v) and kinetic energy (2KE). \n\n3. **New Momentum:** Since the kinetic energy is doubled, and KE is proportional to p^2, the momentum must increase by a factor of \u221a2.  Therefore, the new momentum is p' = \u221a2 * mv.\n\n4. **New de Broglie Wavelength:** The de Broglie wavelength is inversely proportional to momentum.  Since the momentum increases by \u221a2, the new de Broglie wavelength (\u03bb') will be:\n\n    \u03bb' = h/p' = h/(\u221a2 * mv) = (1/\u221a2) * (h/mv) = (1/\u221a2) * \u03bb\n\n5. **The Result:** We see that the new de Broglie wavelength is (1/\u221a2) times the initial wavelength.

    "5009": "The question is actually **not** related to the photoelectric effect. It deals with the concept of **de Broglie wavelength**, a fundamental principle in wave-particle duality. \n\nHere's the detailed explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **De Broglie Wavelength:**  Louis de Broglie proposed that all matter exhibits wave-like properties. The wavelength associated with a particle is known as its de Broglie wavelength.\n* **Formula:** The de Broglie wavelength (\u03bb) is given by:\n\n  \u03bb = h/p \n\n  where:\n    * h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J s)\n    * p is the momentum of the particle (p = mv, where m is mass and v is velocity)\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Identifying the given information:**\n   * The question states that both the proton and alpha particle are moving with the **same velocity (v)**.\n\n2. **Applying the de Broglie wavelength formula:**\n   * Let \u03bbp be the de Broglie wavelength of the proton and \u03bb\u03b1 be the de Broglie wavelength of the alpha particle.\n   * \u03bbp = h/(mp * v)\n   * \u03bb\u03b1 = h/(m\u03b1 * v)\n\n3. **Finding the ratio:**\n   * Divide \u03bbp by \u03bb\u03b1:\n\n   (\u03bbp / \u03bb\u03b1) = [h/(mp * v)] / [h/(m\u03b1 * v)]\n\n   * Simplifying, we get:\n\n   (\u03bbp / \u03bb\u03b1) = (m\u03b1 / mp)\n\n4. **Masses of proton and alpha particle:**\n   * Mass of a proton (mp) = 1.672 x 10^-27 kg\n   * Mass of an alpha particle (m\u03b1) = 4 * 1.672 x 10^-27 kg (approximately 4 times the mass of a proton)\n\n5. **Calculating the ratio:**\n\n   (\u03bbp / \u03bb\u03b1) = (4 * 1.672 x 10^-27 kg) / (1.672 x 10^-27 kg) = 4\n\n**Therefore, the ratio of de Broglie wavelengths of a proton and an alpha particle moving with the same velocity is 4.**\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam:**\n\n* **Wave-particle duality:** This question emphasizes the wave-particle duality of matter, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics.\n* **De Broglie wavelength:**  Understand the formula for de Broglie wavelength and its applications in calculating the wavelength of particles.\n* **Momentum and wavelength:**  The de Broglie wavelength is inversely proportional to the momentum of the particle.\n* **Mass and wavelength:**  For particles moving at the same velocity, the de Broglie wavelength is inversely proportional to the mass of the particle.\n\n**Note:** While the question asks about de Broglie wavelength, the photoelectric effect is a different phenomenon. It deals with the emission of electrons from a metal surface when light shines on it. \n",
    "5010": "## Explanation of the Answer:\n\nYou are absolutely correct! The answer is **Assertion is True but the Reason is False**. Here's why:\n\n**Assertion (True):**\n\n* **De Broglie Wavelength:** The de Broglie wavelength (\u03bb) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) by the following equation: \n    \u03bb = h/p \n    where 'h' is Planck's constant.\n* **Kinetic Energy and Momentum:** The kinetic energy (KE) of a particle is related to its momentum by:\n    KE = p\u00b2/2m \n    where 'm' is the mass of the particle.\n* **Combining the Equations:** If two particles have the same kinetic energy, the lighter particle will have a higher momentum (from the KE equation).  This higher momentum leads to a smaller de Broglie wavelength (from the de Broglie equation). \n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, among particles with the same kinetic energy, the lighter particle will have a greater de Broglie wavelength.\n\n**Reason (False):**\n\n* The de Broglie wavelength of a particle depends on its **momentum**, not its charge.  \n* The charge of a particle is relevant for its interaction with electromagnetic fields, but not for determining its de Broglie wavelength.\n\n**Steps to Solve the Question:**\n\n1. **Understand the concept of de Broglie wavelength and its relation to momentum.**\n2. **Recall the relation between kinetic energy and momentum.**\n3. **Analyze the effect of mass on momentum when kinetic energy is constant.**\n4. **Apply the de Broglie equation to understand the effect of momentum on wavelength.**\n5. **Conclude that lighter particles have higher momentum and thus, a greater de Broglie wavelength.**\n6. **Identify the reason as false because it incorrectly states the dependency of de Broglie wavelength on charge.**\n\n**Relevant Formulas:**\n\n* **de Broglie wavelength:**  \u03bb = h/p\n* **Kinetic Energy:** KE = p\u00b2/2m\n* **Momentum:** p = mv (where 'v' is velocity)\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation:**\n\n* **Wave-particle duality:** All matter exhibits wave-like properties, as described by de Broglie's hypothesis.\n* **De Broglie wavelength:** The wavelength of a particle is inversely proportional to its momentum.\n* **Kinetic energy and momentum:** These are important concepts in understanding the motion of particles.\n* **Photoelectric effect:**  While not directly related to de Broglie wavelength, the photoelectric effect demonstrates the particle nature of light, further supporting wave-particle duality.\n* **Focus on understanding the relationships between different concepts.**  \n\n**Important Note:**  The question incorrectly attributes the topic to 'Photoelectric Effect'. While both deal with the wave-particle duality of matter, the photoelectric effect specifically deals with the interaction of light with matter, particularly the emission of electrons from a material when light shines on it. The question focuses on the de Broglie hypothesis, which is a broader concept applying to all matter. \n"
