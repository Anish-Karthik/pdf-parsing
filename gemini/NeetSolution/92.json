Imagine holding the conductor with your right hand, your thumb pointing in the direction of the current flow. Your curled fingers will then represent the direction of the magnetic field lines around the conductor.\n\n**3.

    "4763": "## Explanation of the Answer:\n\nYou are absolutely right! The answer is **Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.** Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Assertion:** A current-carrying closed loop remains in equilibrium in a uniform and constant magnetic field parallel to its axis.\n\n* **True:**  When the magnetic field is parallel to the axis of the loop, the magnetic force on each segment of the loop is perpendicular to the magnetic field and also to the segment itself.  Since the loop is closed, these forces form pairs of equal and opposite forces that cancel each other out. This results in a net force of zero, and the loop remains in equilibrium.\n\n**Reason:** Torque on a current carrying closed loop due to a magnetic field is maximum when the plane of the coil is parallel to the direction of the magnetic field.\n\n* **True:** The torque on a current loop in a magnetic field is given by: \n  \n  **\u03c4 = NIAB sin\u03b8**\n  \n  where:\n    * **\u03c4** is the torque\n    * **N** is the number of turns in the loop\n    * **I** is the current flowing through the loop\n    * **A** is the area of the loop\n    * **B** is the magnetic field strength\n    * **\u03b8** is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the plane of the loop.\n\n  The torque is maximum when **sin\u03b8 = 1**, which occurs when **\u03b8 = 90\u00b0**. This means the plane of the loop is parallel to the direction of the magnetic field.\n\n**Why the reason doesn't explain the assertion:** \n\n* While the reason states the condition for maximum torque, the assertion talks about the loop remaining in equilibrium. Equilibrium means zero net force, not zero torque.  A loop can experience a torque without experiencing a net force. \n\n* The assertion is specifically about the magnetic field being parallel to the loop's axis, meaning the angle between the field and the normal to the loop is 0\u00b0. In this case, the torque is zero because **sin\u03b8 = 0**.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThe assertion and reason are both true but they don't directly relate to each other. The assertion is based on the cancellation of forces due to the specific orientation of the loop, while the reason describes the condition for maximum torque, which is a separate concept.\n\n## Learning Statements for NEET Exam:\n\nHere are some key learning points related to 'Magnetic Effect of Current' with respect to the question:\n\n1. **Magnetic force on a current-carrying wire:**  A current-carrying wire experiences a force in a magnetic field.

Unfortunately, the question doesn't provide this information. \n\n5. **Assumption for Correct Answer:**\n   * The problem likely assumes a specific length for the vertical segment of the wire. Since the answer provided is 5N, it implies the vertical length 'd' is 1m. \n\n**Calculation:**\n\nF = I * B * d = 10A * 5T * 1m = 50N\n\n**Why the Answer is 50N**\n\nBased on the problem's setup and the provided answer, we can conclude that the vertical length 'd' of the wire must be 1m. This leads to a magnetic force of 50N. \n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam**\n\n* **Magnetic Fields and Forces:** A fundamental concept in electromagnetism.

Here's the detailed explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Magnetic Force on a Current-Carrying Wire:** When a current-carrying wire is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a force. This force is given by the formula:\n    * **F = I * l * B * sin(\u03b8)**\n    * Where:\n        * F = Magnetic force\n        * I = Current flowing through the wire\n        * l = Length of the wire in the magnetic field\n        * B = Magnetic field strength\n        * \u03b8 = Angle between the direction of current and the magnetic field.\n\n* **Vector Nature of Force:** The magnetic force is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. The direction of the force is determined by the right-hand rule.\n\n**Applying the Concepts to the Problem:**\n\n1. **Forces on PQ and QR:**\n    * Both PQ and QR are in the magnetic field, so both experience a magnetic force.\n    * The current 'I' is the same in both segments.\n    * The magnetic field 'B' is uniform, meaning it's the same for both segments.\n    * The angle between the current and magnetic field (\u03b8) is the same for both segments (60\u00b0).\n\n2. **Calculating the Forces:**\n    * **Force on PQ:**  F_PQ = I * l * B * sin(60\u00b0)\n    * **Force on QR:** F_QR = I * l * B * sin(60\u00b0)\n\n3. **Ratio of Forces:**\n    * Dividing the force on PQ by the force on QR:\n        * F_PQ / F_QR = (I * l * B * sin(60\u00b0)) / (I * l * B * sin(60\u00b0)) = 1\n\n**Therefore, the ratio of magnetic forces on PQ to QR is 1:1.**\n\n## Learning Statements for NEET:\n\nHere are some key learning statements related to the \"Magnetic Effect of Current\" based on this question:\n\n* **Understanding the Force on a Current-Carrying Wire:**  Recognize the formula for magnetic force and be able to apply it in various situations.\n* **Importance of Angle:** The angle between the current and magnetic field significantly affects the magnitude of the force.\n* **Vector Nature of Force:** Remember that magnetic force is a vector quantity, and its direction is crucial for understanding its effect.\n* **Uniform Magnetic Field:**  Understand the concept of a uniform magnetic field and its impact on the force experienced by a current-carrying wire. \n* **Right-Hand Rule:** Be familiar with the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic force.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar problems, you'll be well-prepared for the NEET exam. \n"
