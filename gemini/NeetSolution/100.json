    "5041": "## Explanation:\n\nThe answer is **1**. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Transition:**\n\n* **Excited State:** When an electron in a hydrogen atom absorbs energy, it jumps to a higher energy level (excited state).\n* **Ground State:** The electron eventually returns to its lowest energy level (ground state), releasing the absorbed energy as light.\n* **Spectral Lines:** Each transition between energy levels corresponds to a specific wavelength of light, resulting in a spectral line. \n\n**Ultraviolet Lines:**\n\n* The question states that three lines are observed in the ultraviolet region. This implies that the electron transitions from an excited state to the ground state in three distinct steps, each releasing ultraviolet light. \n* This suggests that the electron starts in a high energy level (n = x) and falls down to lower levels, eventually reaching n = 1 (ground state). \n\n**Infrared Line:**\n\n* Since the electron already transitioned from the excited state to the ground state in three steps, there is only one possibility for an infrared line:\n    * The electron transitions from n = 2 to n = 1. This transition is in the infrared region because it involves a smaller energy difference compared to the transitions that produced the ultraviolet lines.\n\n**Why Not More Infrared Lines?**\n\n* The electron has already reached the ground state (n = 1).  There are no lower energy levels for it to transition to, hence no other infrared lines are possible.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe three ultraviolet lines represent the electron transitioning from a higher excited state to n = 2, then from n = 2 to n = 1. The only remaining transition from n = 2 to n = 1 produces a single infrared line.\n\n**Relevant Formula:**\n\nThe energy difference between two energy levels in a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the Rydberg formula:\n\n```\n1/\u03bb = R(1/n1\u00b2 - 1/n2\u00b2) \n```\n\nwhere:\n\n* \u03bb is the wavelength of light emitted\n* R is the Rydberg constant (1.097 \u00d7 10\u2077 m\u207b\u00b9)\n* n1 and n2 are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final energy levels respectively\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET:**\n\n* **Hydrogen Atom:** Understanding the electronic configuration and energy levels of the hydrogen atom is crucial for solving atomic structure problems.\n* **Spectral Lines:** The emission spectrum of hydrogen is a key concept for understanding the quantum nature of light and the transitions between energy levels in atoms.\n* **Rydberg Formula:** Familiarize yourself with the Rydberg formula to calculate the wavelengths of emitted light during electronic transitions.\n* **Electromagnetic Spectrum:** Be able to identify the different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (ultraviolet, visible, infrared) and understand how energy levels and wavelengths are related. \n",

    "5045": "## Explanation:\n\nYou are absolutely correct! As the orbit number (or principal quantum number, n) increases, the potential energy (P.E.) of an electron in an atom increases, while its kinetic energy (K.E.) decreases. Here's why:\n\n**1. Potential Energy:**\n\n* **Electrostatic Attraction:** The potential energy of an electron is primarily due to the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged nucleus. \n* **Distance:**  As the electron moves to higher orbits (higher 'n'), it gets farther away from the nucleus. This increased distance weakens the electrostatic force of attraction, leading to an increase in potential energy. Imagine a spring: the further you stretch it, the more potential energy it stores.\n\n**2. Kinetic Energy:**\n\n* **Quantized Orbits:** Electrons in atoms can only occupy specific, quantized energy levels or orbits. The energy of these levels is inversely proportional to the square of the principal quantum number (n). \n* **Lower Energy Levels:**  Higher orbits correspond to higher energy levels (n=1,2,3...). However, the energy difference between consecutive levels decreases as 'n' increases. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the electron decreases as it occupies a higher orbit.\n\n**Formulas:**\n\n* **Potential Energy (P.E.):**  PE = -Ze\u00b2/4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080r, where:\n    * Z is the atomic number\n    * e is the charge of an electron\n    * \u03b5\u2080 is the permittivity of free space\n    * r is the distance between the electron and the nucleus\n* **Kinetic Energy (K.E.):**  KE = -1/2 * PE = Ze\u00b2/8\u03c0\u03b5\u2080r\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Understand the relationship between potential energy and distance:**  P.E. is inversely proportional to the distance between the electron and the nucleus.\n2. **Understand the quantization of energy levels:** The energy of an electron is quantized, meaning it can only exist at specific energy levels.\n3. **Recognize the relationship between energy levels and orbit number:** Higher orbit numbers correspond to higher energy levels, but the energy difference between levels decreases as 'n' increases.\n4. **Deduce the change in K.E. and P.E. with increasing orbit number:** As the electron moves to higher orbits, the distance increases, leading to a decrease in K.E. and an increase in P.E.\n\n**Learning Statements:**\n\n* **Energy levels are quantized:**  Electrons can only occupy specific energy levels, not any arbitrary position.\n* **Higher energy levels correspond to larger orbits:**  Electrons in higher energy levels are further away from the nucleus.\n* **Electrostatic attraction affects electron energy:** The interaction between the nucleus and the electron is the main factor determining the electron's energy.\n* **Understanding atomic structure is crucial for predicting chemical behavior:**  The arrangement of electrons in an atom determines its chemical properties.\n\nRemember, this explanation provides a simplified understanding of the concept.

Centripetal Force & Electrostatic Force:**\n\n* An electron orbiting the nucleus experiences two forces: \n    * **Centripetal force:** This force acts towards the center of the circular path and keeps the electron in orbit. It is given by F_c = mv^2/r, where 'm' is the mass of the electron, 'v' is its speed, and 'r' is the radius of the orbit.\n    * **Electrostatic force:** This force is the attraction between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electron. It is given by F_e = kZe^2/r^2, where 'k' is Coulomb's constant, 'Z' is the atomic number (1 for hydrogen), and 'e' is the charge of an electron.\n\n**3. Balancing the Forces:**\n\n* For the electron to remain in a stable orbit, the centripetal force must be equal to the electrostatic force. \n    * mv^2/r = kZe^2/r^2\n    * Rearranging the equation, we get v^2 = kZe^2/mr\n\n**4.

Here's why:\n\n**1. Understanding the De Broglie Wavelength:**\n\n* **De Broglie's hypothesis:** Louis de Broglie proposed that all matter exhibits wave-like properties. This means even particles like protons have a wavelength associated with them.\n* **Formula:** The de Broglie wavelength (\u03bb) is related to the momentum (p) of a particle by the following equation:\n\n     \u03bb = h/p  where h is Planck's constant.\n\n* **Momentum and Kinetic Energy:** Momentum (p) is the product of mass (m) and velocity (v): p = mv. Kinetic energy (KE) is given by: KE = 1/2 * mv^2.\n\n**2. Solving the problem:**\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between kinetic energy and wavelength:\n\n* **KE and Momentum:** If kinetic energy increases nine times, the momentum will increase three times (because KE is proportional to v^2, and p is proportional to v). This is because KE = 1/2 * mv^2 and p = mv.\n* **Momentum and Wavelength:** Since wavelength is inversely proportional to momentum (\u03bb = h/p), if the momentum increases three times, the wavelength will decrease to 1/3 of its original value.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, increasing the kinetic energy of the proton nine times will result in a de Broglie wavelength that is **1/3 times** its initial value.\n\n**Step-by-step approach:**\n\n1. **Initial state:** Let the initial momentum of the proton be 'p' and its initial wavelength be '\u03bb'.\n2. **Final state:** When kinetic energy increases nine times, the final momentum becomes '3p' (as discussed above).\n3. **Wavelength calculation:** Using the de Broglie equation, the final wavelength (\u03bb') is: \n   \u03bb' = h/(3p) = (1/3) * (h/p) = (1/3)\u03bb\n\n**Relevant Formulas:**\n\n* **De Broglie wavelength:** \u03bb = h/p\n* **Momentum:** p = mv\n* **Kinetic Energy:** KE = 1/2 * mv^2\n\n**Learning Statements:**\n\n* **Dual nature of matter:** The de Broglie hypothesis highlights the wave-particle duality of matter. This means particles like protons can exhibit wave-like properties.\n* **Relationship between wavelength and momentum:** The de Broglie equation shows that wavelength is inversely proportional to momentum.\n* **Understanding kinetic energy and momentum:** Kinetic energy and momentum are related.

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Concept**\n\nThis question revolves around Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. It states that it's impossible to simultaneously determine both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision.  The principle is mathematically expressed as:\n\n**\u0394x * \u0394p \u2265 h/4\u03c0**\n\nwhere:\n\n* **\u0394x** is the uncertainty in position.\n* **\u0394p** is the uncertainty in momentum.\n* **h** is Planck's constant (6.626 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2074 J\u22c5s).\n\n**Applying the Principle to the Question**\n\n1. **Equal Uncertainty in Position:** The question states that the uncertainty in position (\u0394x) is the same for both the electron and the helium atom. \n\n2. **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:**  Since \u0394x is the same for both, and Planck's constant (h) is a universal constant, the product (\u0394x * \u0394p) must also be the same for both the electron and the helium atom.\n\n3. **Uncertainty in Momentum:** The question gives the uncertainty in momentum (\u0394p) for the electron as 32 \u00d7 10\u2075.  Since the product (\u0394x * \u0394p) is constant, the uncertainty in momentum for the helium atom will also be **32 \u00d7 10\u2075**.\n\n**Why Mass Doesn't Matter Here**\n\nYou might be tempted to think that the mass of the helium atom (much larger than an electron) would influence the uncertainty in momentum. However, the Uncertainty Principle applies to all particles, regardless of their mass.  The key factor here is that the uncertainty in position is the same for both particles.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Preparation**\n\n* **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics.** It highlights the inherent limits of our knowledge about particles at the atomic and subatomic levels.\n* **The Uncertainty Principle has no dependence on the mass of the particle.** It applies to all particles, regardless of their size or mass.\n* **Understanding the relationship between position and momentum uncertainties is crucial for interpreting quantum phenomena.**\n\n**Important Tip for NEET:**  Many NEET questions focus on applying the principles of quantum mechanics, particularly the Uncertainty Principle. Practice interpreting problems related to this principle, and remember that it is a fundamental concept that can be applied to various scenarios. \n",

    "5079": "The answer provided is **incorrect**. When an electron jumps from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, its **momentum does not increase**. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Energy Levels and Electron Transitions**\n\n* **Energy Levels:** Electrons in an atom exist in specific energy levels, often depicted as shells or orbitals. Higher energy levels are further away from the nucleus.\n* **Electron Transitions:**  Electrons can move between these energy levels by absorbing or releasing energy.\n* **Absorption:** When an electron absorbs energy (like from light), it jumps to a higher energy level.\n* **Emission:** When an electron loses energy (by emitting light), it falls to a lower energy level.\n\n**Momentum and Electron Transitions**\n\nMomentum is a measure of an object's mass and velocity.  While an electron's energy changes during a transition, its **mass remains constant**. \n\n**What Actually Happens**\n\n1. **Energy Loss:** When an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it releases energy in the form of a photon (a packet of light).\n2. **No Momentum Change:**  The emitted photon carries away the energy difference between the levels, but it does not directly affect the electron's momentum.\n3. **Slight Momentum Change (Negligible):**  There might be a very slight change in the electron's momentum due to the recoil from emitting the photon. However, this change is extremely small and insignificant in most practical scenarios.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** The primary change during an electron transition is a **change in energy**, not a change in momentum.\n\n**Learning Statements for NEET Exam Preparation**\n\n* **Electron Configuration:** Understand the different energy levels and how electrons are distributed within an atom (e.g., the Aufbau principle, Hund's rule).\n* **Atomic Spectra:**  Learn how electron transitions cause the emission of specific wavelengths of light, leading to characteristic atomic spectra.\n* **Bohr Model:** Be familiar with the basics of Bohr's model, which explained the quantized energy levels of electrons in the hydrogen atom.\n* **Quantum Numbers:** Understand the four quantum numbers (n, l, ml, and ms) and how they describe the properties of electrons in atoms.\n* **Energy Level Diagrams:** Practice drawing and interpreting energy level diagrams, showing electron transitions.\n\nBy focusing on these key concepts, you can build a solid understanding of atomic structure for NEET exam preparation. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Bohr's Model and its Limitations:**\n\n* **Bohr's model is a planetary model:** It describes electrons orbiting the nucleus in fixed, circular orbits, similar to planets orbiting the Sun. This model is based on classical physics. \n* **Quantized Energy Levels:**  The model successfully explains the quantized energy levels of electrons, meaning electrons can only exist in specific energy levels, not in between. \n* **Limitations:**  The Bohr model fails to explain:\n    * **Spectra of polyelectronic atoms:** It can only explain the spectra of hydrogen and other single-electron species.\n    * **Zeeman effect:**  The splitting of spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field.\n    * **Wave-particle duality:** It treats electrons solely as particles, ignoring their wave-like nature.\n\n**Wave-Particle Duality:**\n\n* **De Broglie Hypothesis:**  Louis de Broglie proposed that all matter exhibits wave-like properties.
