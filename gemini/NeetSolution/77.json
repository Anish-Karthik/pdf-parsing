It is independent of the medium the wave is traveling through. \n* **Wavelength (\u03bb):** This is the distance between two consecutive crests or troughs of the wave. It depends on the speed of the wave in the medium.\n* **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant value (approximately 3 x 10\u2078 m/s). In a medium, the speed of light decreases due to the interaction with the medium's particles.\n* **Relative Permittivity (\u03b5r):** This is a measure of how much a material reduces the speed of light compared to a vacuum. Higher \u03b5r means a slower speed of light in the medium.\n\n**Applying the Concepts:**\n\n1. **Frequency Remains Unchanged:**  The frequency of an electromagnetic wave is determined by the source that generates it. When the wave enters a new medium, the source remains the same, and hence the frequency remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Wavelength Changes:** As the wave enters the dielectric medium, the speed of light decreases.
