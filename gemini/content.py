para_jumbles_prompt="""
Create two para-jumble question with 5 sentences labeled A, B, C, D, and E. 
The sentences should form a coherent paragraph when arranged in the correct order. 
Provide 4 possible sequence options and indicate the correct answer. 
Include a brief reasoning of why the chosen sequence is correct, highlighting key logical connections or transitions between sentences. 
Ensure the topic is interesting and substantive, avoiding overly simplistic or obvious arrangements. 
After presenting the question, verify that the correct sequence indeed forms a logical and well-flowing paragraph.

Example 1:
A. However, recent studies have shown that bees can also perceive and differentiate between various floral scents.
B. Bees have long been known for their remarkable ability to see ultraviolet light, which helps them locate nectar-rich flowers.
C. This combination of visual and olfactory cues allows bees to efficiently identify and remember the most rewarding flower species.
D. These scents act as chemical signals, providing bees with additional information about the flower's nectar quality and quantity.
E. The discovery of this dual sensory system has shed new light on the complex relationship between bees and flowers in pollination.
Options:

BADCE
BACED
CEBAD
ABCDE

Correct Answer: 2. BACED
Explanation: The paragraph should start with B, introducing the known ability of bees to see ultraviolet light. A follows, contrasting this with the recent discovery about scent perception. C explains how bees use both visual and olfactory cues. E concludes by emphasizing the significance of this dual sensory system in understanding bee-flower relationships.
Verify that the sequence BACED forms a logical and coherent paragraph.

Example 2:
Q) In the question given below, some sentences are given, find the sentence which is not really contributing to the main theme and OUT of the passage or find the odd sentence and rearrange the remaining sentences to make a coherent paragraph.

(A) Dozens more were missing.

E-B-D-A-C
C-D-A-E
E-A-B-D
D-C-B-E-A

Correct Answer:  3. E-A-B-D
Explanation: After going through all the given five sentences, we can easily mark sentence C as the odd one it is talking about businesses but this whole paragraph is about landslides and casualties."""
