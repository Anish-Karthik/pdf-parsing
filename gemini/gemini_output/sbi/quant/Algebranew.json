Using this property, we can rewrite \u221a(9 x 5) as \u221a9 x \u221a5.\n\n4. **Simplify:**  \u221a9 = 3, so \u221a45 simplifies to 3\u221a5.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is A) 3\u221a5.**\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **B) 5\u221a3:** This incorrectly assumes that the square root of 45 is the product of the square roots of 5 and 3.\n* **C) 9\u221a5:** This incorrectly takes the square root of the entire number 45 and multiplies it by \u221a5.\n* **D) \u221a9 + \u221a5:** This does not simplify the expression, but simply rewrites it in a different form.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Perfect Square:** A perfect square is a number that can be obtained by squaring an integer (e.g., 9 is a perfect square because 3\u00b2 = 9).\n* **Product Property of Radicals:** \u221a(a x b) = \u221aa x \u221ab.\n\n**Applying the concept to similar questions:**\n\nTo simplify other radical expressions, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the largest perfect square that divides the number under the radical.**\n2. **Rewrite the radical using the product property.**\n3. **Simplify the perfect square radical.**\n\nFor example, to simplify \u221a72:\n\n1. The largest perfect square that divides 72 is 36 (since 36 x 2 = 72).\n2. \u221a72 = \u221a(36 x 2) = \u221a36 x \u221a2\n3. \u221a36 = 6, so \u221a72 simplifies to 6\u221a2.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Banking Exams:**\n\nSimplifying radical expressions is a fundamental skill in mathematics and is tested in various competitive exams like IBPS PO, SBI PO, and other banking exams. This skill helps in solving problems related to:\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:**  Simplification questions often involve radicals.\n* **Data Interpretation:**  Interpreting data and calculations may involve manipulating radical expressions.\n* **Reasoning:**  Understanding the properties of radicals can aid in solving logical reasoning questions.\n\nBy mastering the concept of simplifying radical expressions, you'll be better equipped to tackle these types of questions and improve your overall score in these exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks us to find the cost of a cookie and a cupcake.  This involves setting up and solving a system of linear equations. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define Variables:**\n\n* Let 'c' represent the cost of one cookie.\n* Let 'u' represent the cost of one cupcake.\n\n**2. Formulate Equations:**\n\n* **Monday:**  They sold 15 cookies (15c) and 10 cupcakes (10u) for a total of $75. This gives us the equation: 15c + 10u = 75\n* **Tuesday:** They sold 20 cookies (20c) and 5 cupcakes (5u) for a total of $60. This gives us the equation: 20c + 5u = 60\n\n**3. Solve the System of Equations:**\n\nThere are a few ways to solve this system. Here's one method using elimination:\n\n* **Multiply the second equation by 2:** This will make the coefficients of 'u' the same in both equations.\n    2 * (20c + 5u = 60)  -->  40c + 10u = 120\n\n* **Subtract the first equation from the modified second equation:** This eliminates 'u'.\n    (40c + 10u = 120) - (15c + 10u = 75)  -->  25c = 45\n\n* **Solve for 'c':**\n    25c = 45  -->  c = 45 / 25 = 1.80 \n\n* **Substitute the value of 'c' in either original equation to solve for 'u':**\n    Let's use the first equation: 15 * 1.80 + 10u = 75\n    --> 27 + 10u = 75\n    --> 10u = 48\n    --> u = 48 / 10 = 4.80\n\n**4.  Check the Solution:**\n\n* Plug the values of 'c' and 'u' back into the original equations to make sure they hold true.\n\n**5.  Answer:**\n\nThe cost of a cookie (c) is $1.80, and the cost of a cupcake (u) is $4.80.  \n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\nNone of the provided options satisfy both equations.  For example, Option A (Cookie: $3, Cupcake: $2) would result in a total cost of $65 on Monday, not $75. \n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question demonstrates the importance of setting up and solving systems of linear equations, a common concept tested in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. By understanding this method, you can confidently tackle similar problems involving multiple variables and constraints. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks us to represent Sarah's fruit purchase scenario using a system of inequalities. Let's break down the information and the answer choices:\n\n* **Variables:** \n    *  'a' represents the number of apples\n    * 'o' represents the number of oranges\n* **Conditions:**\n    * Sarah wants at least 5 pieces of fruit:  a + o \u2265 5\n    * Sarah has a budget of $4: a + 0.5o \u2264 4 \n\n**Why Option A is correct:**\n\nOption A presents the following inequalities:\n\n* **a + o \u2265 5** This inequality directly translates the condition that Sarah wants to buy at least 5 pieces of fruit. The total number of apples (a) plus the number of oranges (o) must be greater than or equal to 5.\n* **a + 0.5o \u2264 4**  This inequality represents Sarah's budget constraint. The cost of apples (a * $1) plus the cost of oranges (o * $0.50) should be less than or equal to $4.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B:**  a + o \u2264 5 and a + 0.5o \u2265 4. This option suggests Sarah wants to buy no more than 5 pieces of fruit (a + o \u2264 5) and spend at least $4 (a + 0.5o \u2265 4), contradicting the given information.\n* **Option C:** a + o \u2265 5 and a + 0.5o \u2265 4. This option suggests buying at least 5 fruits and spending at least $4, which again contradicts the given information. \n* **Option D:** a + o \u2264 5 and a + 0.5o \u2264 4. This option suggests Sarah wants to buy no more than 5 pieces of fruit and spend no more than $4. While this doesn't directly contradict the given information, it doesn't accurately represent the condition that Sarah wants to buy at least 5 fruits.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nOption A correctly captures both conditions: the minimum number of fruits Sarah wants to buy and her budget constraint. \n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Understanding inequalities:** Be comfortable interpreting inequalities and translating word problems into mathematical expressions.\n* **Word problems:** Carefully analyze the given information and identify the variables and conditions.\n* **Systems of inequalities:**  Understand how to represent multiple conditions using a system of inequalities.\n* **Analyzing answer choices:**  Thoroughly evaluate each answer choice and determine if it aligns with the problem conditions.\n\nBy practicing these concepts, you can confidently tackle similar problems in the IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question is designed to test your understanding of the graphical method of solving linear programming problems, a fundamental concept in Operations Research often tested in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Defining the Variables:**\n\n* **x:** Number of chocolate cakes\n* **y:** Number of vanilla cakes\n\n**2. Formulating the Constraints:**\n\n* **Baking Time Constraint:** Each chocolate cake takes 2 hours and each vanilla cake takes 1 hour. The bakery has 10 hours available. This translates to the inequality: **2x + y \u2264 10**\n* **Flour Constraint:** Each chocolate cake requires 1 pound of flour and each vanilla cake needs 2 pounds. The bakery has 8 pounds of flour. This leads to the inequality: **x + 2y \u2264 8**\n\n**3. Non-Negativity Constraints:**  \nSince we cannot produce a negative number of cakes, we have: \n* **x \u2265 0**\n* **y \u2265 0**\n\n**4. Graphical Representation:**\n\n* **Plot the Constraints:** Each constraint is a linear inequality. To graph them, treat them as equations.\n    * **2x + y = 10:**  To plot this line, find the x and y intercepts. When x = 0, y = 10. When y = 0, x = 5. Plot these points and draw the line connecting them.\n    * **x + 2y = 8:** Similarly, find the intercepts. When x = 0, y = 4. When y = 0, x = 8. Plot these points and draw the line.\n    * **x = 0 and y = 0:** These represent the y-axis and x-axis respectively.\n\n* **Shading the Feasible Region:** The feasible region is the area on the graph where all constraints are satisfied. This is the area where the shaded regions of all inequalities overlap.\n\n**5. Identifying the Optimal Point:**\n\n* **Objective Function:** The question asks for the maximum number of chocolate cakes (x). This is our objective function: **Maximize x**\n* **Corner Points:** The feasible region is a polygon. The maximum value of x will occur at one of the corner points of this polygon. \n* **Testing Corner Points:** Calculate the value of x at each corner point. The point with the highest value of x will give you the maximum number of chocolate cakes you can produce.\n\n**In this case, the corner point that maximizes x is (2, 3). This means you can produce a maximum of 2 chocolate cakes (x = 2) and 3 vanilla cakes (y = 3).**\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C) 2.**\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThe graphical method is a powerful tool for solving linear programming problems. By plotting the constraints and identifying the feasible region, you can find the optimal solution that maximizes or minimizes your objective function. This method is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and decision-making in various business scenarios. \n",

This involves multiplying two polynomials, and we can achieve this using the distributive property.\n\n**1. Distributive Property:**\n\nThe distributive property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac. We can apply this property twice to multiply our polynomials.\n\n* First, multiply the first term of the first polynomial (3x\u00b2) by each term of the second polynomial:\n    * (3x\u00b2) * (2x) = 6x\u00b3\n    * (3x\u00b2) * (-5) = -15x\u00b2\n\n* Next, multiply the second term of the first polynomial (2x) by each term of the second polynomial:\n    * (2x) * (2x) = 4x\u00b2\n    * (2x) * (-5) = -10x\n\n* Finally, multiply the third term of the first polynomial (-1) by each term of the second polynomial:\n    * (-1) * (2x) = -2x\n    * (-1) * (-5) = 5\n\n**2. Combining Like Terms:**\n\nNow we have: 6x\u00b3 - 15x\u00b2 + 4x\u00b2 - 10x - 2x + 5\n\nCombine the terms with the same powers of x:\n\n* 6x\u00b3 \n* -15x\u00b2 + 4x\u00b2 = -11x\u00b2\n* -10x - 2x = -12x\n* + 5\n\n**3. Simplified Expression:**\n\nThe simplified expression is **6x\u00b3 - 11x\u00b2 - 12x + 5**\n\n**Therefore, option A is the correct answer.**\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThe distributive property is crucial for multiplying polynomials. By consistently applying it, you can expand the product of two polynomials and then simplify the resulting expression by combining like terms. This process is essential for various algebraic manipulations and problem-solving in mathematics. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nMultiplying polynomials is a fundamental concept in algebra and is often used in higher-level mathematics, including calculus.

This problem requires us to form a quadratic equation and solve it to find the width. \n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Define variables:** Let 'w' represent the width of the garden.\n2. **Express length in terms of width:**  The length is \"3 meters more than twice its width\", which translates to  '2w + 3'.\n3. **Form the equation:**  The area of a rectangle is length * width. We know the area is 54 square meters. So, we have the equation:  w * (2w + 3) = 54\n4. **Simplify and solve the quadratic equation:**\n   - Expand the equation: 2w\u00b2 + 3w - 54 = 0\n   - This is a quadratic equation in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. We can solve it by factoring or using the quadratic formula.  \n   - Factoring the equation gives us (2w - 9)(w + 6) = 0\n   - This gives us two possible solutions: w = 9/2 or w = -6.\n5. **Choose the valid solution:** Since width cannot be negative, we discard w = -6. \n6. **Consider the answer options:**  The width, w = 9/2 = 4.5 meters, but the options only include whole numbers.

Instead, it's a problem involving **simple interest calculation and basic algebra**. Here's a breakdown of how to solve it:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* The bank charges a standard 5% interest per annum.\n* A penalty of \u20b9500 is added if the loan amount exceeds \u20b910 lakh.\n* The borrower pays a total of \u20b910,000 in interest and penalty. \n* We need to find the total loan amount.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the interest paid:** The total amount paid is \u20b910,000, and the penalty is \u20b9500. Therefore, the interest paid is \u20b910,000 - \u20b9500 = \u20b99,500.\n\n2. **Find the loan amount exceeding \u20b910 lakh:** Let 'x' be the loan amount exceeding \u20b910 lakh. The interest on this amount is calculated as 5% of 'x', which is 0.05x.\n\n3. **Set up an equation:** We know the interest is \u20b99,500.  So, we can write the equation: 0.05x = \u20b99,500\n\n4. **Solve for x:** Divide both sides of the equation by 0.05: x = \u20b99,500 / 0.05 = \u20b9190,000\n\n5. **Calculate the total loan amount:**  The total loan amount is the amount exceeding \u20b910 lakh plus the initial \u20b910 lakh. Therefore, the total loan amount is \u20b9190,000 + \u20b910,00,000 = \u20b922,00,000 or \u20b922 lakh.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option D: \u20b922 lakh.**\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Simple Interest:**  Interest calculated only on the principal amount.\n* **Algebraic Equations:**  Using variables and equations to represent unknown quantities and solve problems.\n\n**Why this is relevant for IBPS PO, SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** This problem tests your ability to apply basic mathematical concepts and solve real-world problems.\n* **Logical Reasoning:**  Understanding the problem, breaking it down into smaller parts, and solving it step-by-step is crucial for success in these exams.\n\n**Tips for similar questions:**\n\n* **Read carefully:** Understand the conditions and terms mentioned in the problem.\n* **Identify the key information:**  Highlight the important numbers and relationships.\n* **Use variables:** Represent unknown quantities with variables to set up equations.\n* **Solve the equations:**  Apply algebraic techniques to find the solutions.\n\nBy understanding the concepts and applying these strategies, you can tackle similar questions in IBPS PO, SBI PO, and other banking exams effectively. \n",

This is because the question describes a scenario where the principal amount increases by $50 every month. To accurately calculate the interest earned, we must consider the updated principal amount at the end of each month, which is the initial principal plus the monthly increase.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A. `interest = principal * 0.025 / 12`:** This formula only calculates the interest based on the initial principal amount, completely ignoring the monthly increase of $50. This would result in a lower interest earned than what is actually accrued.\n\n* **C. `interest = (principal * 0.025 / 12) + 50`:** This formula incorrectly adds the monthly increase of $50 to the calculated interest. Interest is calculated on the balance, not added to it. This would lead to an overestimation of the interest earned.\n\n* **D. `interest = principal * 0.025 / 12 + (50 * 0.025 / 12)`:** This formula calculates the interest on the initial principal and then adds a separate interest calculation on the monthly increase. This approach is not how interest is typically calculated in a savings account. Interest is applied to the entire balance at the end of the month, not calculated separately for each component of the balance.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Principal:** The initial amount deposited in the savings account.\n* **Interest Rate:** The percentage at which interest is accrued on the principal.\n* **Interest:** The earnings generated on the principal amount based on the interest rate.\n* **Compounding:**  The process of earning interest on both the principal and previously accumulated interest.\n\n**In this particular scenario, the interest is compounded monthly:**\n\n1. At the end of each month, the principal amount increases by $50.\n2. The interest is calculated on the new principal amount, which includes the initial principal and the monthly increase. \n3. The interest earned is added to the principal, increasing the balance for the next month's interest calculation.\n\n**Understanding the concept of compounding is crucial for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Setting up the Inequality:**\n\n* **Flat Fee:** The rental company charges a fixed $35, which is independent of the number of miles driven.\n* **Per-Mile Charge:** The customer is charged $0.25 for each mile driven.\n* **Budget Constraint:** The customer wants to keep the total cost below $100.\n\nLet's represent the number of miles driven by 'x'.  We can express the total cost as:\n\n**Total Cost = Flat Fee + (Cost per mile * Number of miles)**\n\n**Total Cost = $35 + ($0.25 * x)**\n\nSince the customer wants to stay within a $100 budget, we can set up the following inequality:\n\n**$35 + $0.25x \u2264 $100**\n\n**2.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Defining the Variables:**\n\n* Let 'x' represent the number of Toy A produced.\n* Let 'y' represent the number of Toy B produced.\n\n**2. Formulating the Constraints:**\n\n* **Plastic Constraint:** 3x + 2y \u2264 18 (Toy A needs 3 units of plastic, Toy B needs 2 units, and the total available plastic is 18 units)\n* **Labor Constraint:** 2x + 4y \u2264 20 (Toy A needs 2 hours of labor, Toy B needs 4 hours, and the total available labor is 20 hours)\n* **Non-negativity Constraints:** x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0 (We cannot produce a negative number of toys)\n\n**3. Plotting the Constraints:**\n\n* **Plastic Constraint:** \n    * To plot this, we can find the intercepts:\n        * When x = 0, y = 9 (18/2 = 9)\n        * When y = 0, x = 6 (18/3 = 6)\n    * Plot these points and draw a line connecting them. \n* **Labor Constraint:**\n    * Similarly, find the intercepts:\n        * When x = 0, y = 5 (20/4 = 5)\n        * When y = 0, x = 10 (20/2 = 10)\n    * Plot these points and draw a line connecting them.\n* **Non-negativity Constraints:** This simply restricts the feasible region to the first quadrant of the graph (where both x and y are positive).\n\n**4. Identifying the Feasible Region:**\n\n* The feasible region is the area on the graph enclosed by the lines representing the constraints. It's the area where all the constraints are satisfied simultaneously.\n\n**5. Maximizing Toy A Production:**\n\n* The goal is to maximize the production of Toy A (represented by 'x'). This means we need to find the point within the feasible region that lies furthest along the x-axis. \n* This point will be one of the corner points of the feasible region.\n* By analyzing the graph, we can see that the point (6, 0) is the corner point furthest along the x-axis within the feasible region.\n\n**6. Interpreting the Result:**\n\n* The point (6, 0) represents producing 6 units of Toy A and 0 units of Toy B. This is the maximum number of Toy A that can be produced while still satisfying all the resource constraints.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is Option C (6, 0).**\n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Understand the concept of feasible regions:** This is a fundamental concept in Linear Programming and often appears in these exams.\n* **Be comfortable with graphing linear inequalities:** The Graphical Method relies heavily on plotting lines and identifying the feasible region.\n* **Learn to interpret the corner points:** Corner points of the feasible region represent potential optimal solutions, which need to be analyzed to find the best option.\n* **Practice similar problems:** There are plenty of resources available online and in textbooks for practice.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **(a) |r - 6| \u2264 2**. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Absolute Value:**\n\n* **Absolute value** of a number is its distance from zero, regardless of direction. For example, |5| = 5 and |-5| = 5.\n* In the context of this problem, the absolute value inequality |r - 6| \u2264 2 tells us that the *difference* between the actual interest rate 'r' and the base rate 6% is less than or equal to 2 percentage points.\n\n**Breaking Down the Inequality:**\n\n* **|r - 6| \u2264 2:** This inequality represents all values of 'r' that are within 2 units of 6 on the number line. \n* **To solve this inequality, we consider two cases:**\n    * **Case 1: r - 6 \u2265 0**\n       * In this case, |r - 6| = r - 6.\n       * Therefore, r - 6 \u2264 2.\n       * Solving for r, we get r \u2264 8.\n    * **Case 2: r - 6 < 0**\n       * In this case, |r - 6| = -(r - 6).\n       * Therefore, -(r - 6) \u2264 2.\n       * Solving for r, we get r \u2265 4.\n\n**Combining the Solutions:**\n\n* Combining the solutions from both cases, we get 4 \u2264 r \u2264 8. This means the interest rate 'r' can be any value between 4% and 8%, inclusive. \n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(b) |r + 6| \u2264 2:** This would imply the interest rate is within 2 percentage points of -6%, which is not possible in a real-world banking scenario.\n* **(c) |r - 2| \u2264 6:** This would imply the interest rate is within 6 percentage points of 2%, which is a much wider range than the problem specifies.\n* **(d) |r + 2| \u2264 6:**  This would imply the interest rate is within 6 percentage points of -2%, again, not a realistic scenario.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is commonly seen in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, as it tests your understanding of:\n\n* **Basic mathematical concepts:** Absolute value, inequalities, and their application to real-world scenarios.\n* **Financial concepts:** Interest rates and how they fluctuate in market conditions.\n\n**Applying the Concept:**\n\nTo solve similar questions:\n\n1. **Identify the base value and the allowable variation:** In this case, the base interest rate is 6%, and the variation is \u00b12%.\n2. **Set up the absolute value inequality:** Use the form |r - base value| \u2264 variation.\n3. **Solve the inequality:** Consider both positive and negative cases of the absolute value.\n4. **Interpret the solution:** The solution will represent the range of possible values for the variable.\n\nBy practicing these steps, you can confidently solve similar questions in your banking exams. \n",

Setting up the Inequality:**\n\n* The question states that the company's profit needs to be *at least* $2000. This translates to the inequality: `P(x) >= 2000` \n*  Since `P(x)` is in thousands of dollars, we convert $2000 to 2 units in the inequality.\n* Substitute the given function `P(x) = -2x\u00b2 + 12x - 10` into the inequality:  \n    `-2x\u00b2 + 12x - 10 >= 2`\n\n**2. Simplifying the Inequality:**\n\n* Subtract 2 from both sides: \n    `-2x\u00b2 + 12x - 12 >= 0`\n* Divide both sides by -2 (remember to reverse the inequality sign):\n    `x\u00b2 - 6x + 6 <= 0`\n\n**3. Understanding the Nature of Roots:**\n\n* The inequality `x\u00b2 - 6x + 6 <= 0` is a quadratic inequality.  The solution depends on the roots of the quadratic equation:\n    `x\u00b2 - 6x + 6 = 0`\n* The roots represent the x-values where the quadratic function intersects the x-axis (i.e., where the function equals zero). \n* **Key Concept:**  The nature of roots determines the sign of the quadratic expression.  A quadratic expression is:\n    * **Negative:** between its roots if the coefficient of the x\u00b2 term is positive.\n    * **Positive:** outside its roots if the coefficient of the x\u00b2 term is positive.\n\n**4. Solving for the Roots:**\n\n* Use the quadratic formula to find the roots of `x\u00b2 - 6x + 6 = 0`:\n    `x = (6 \u00b1 \u221a(6\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * 6)) / (2 * 1) = (6 \u00b1 \u221a12) / 2 = 3 \u00b1 \u221a3`\n* The roots are approximately `1.27` and `4.73`.\n\n**5. Finding the Solution:**\n\n* The coefficient of x\u00b2 in the inequality is positive (1), so the parabola opens upwards.\n* The inequality is satisfied when the expression `x\u00b2 - 6x + 6` is *less than or equal to zero*. \n* This happens when x is **between** the roots, i.e., `1.27 < x < 4.73`.\n\n**6. Applying the Solution:**\n\n* Since the company can only produce whole units (in hundreds), the range of units they need to produce is **between 2 and 4 hundred units** (inclusive).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reasoning combines the understanding of quadratic inequalities, the nature of roots, and how the roots determine the solution to the inequality. This allows us to accurately determine the range of units the company needs to produce to ensure a profit of at least $2000. \n",

Defining the Problem:**\n\n* **Objective:** The company wants to maximize its profit.\n* **Constraints:**  They are limited by the amount of labor and raw materials available, and they must produce at least 10 units of product B.\n\n**2.

Graphical Solution:**\n\n* **Plotting the Constraints:** We need to graph each inequality on the x-y plane. For example, for the labor constraint (3x + 2y \u2264 120), find the intercepts (when x = 0, y = 60 and when y = 0, x = 40). Then, draw a line connecting these points. The feasible region lies below this line.\n* **Identifying the Feasible Region:** The feasible region is the area that satisfies all the constraints. In this case, it's a polygon enclosed by the lines and the y-axis.\n* **Corner Points:**  Find the coordinates of the corner points of the feasible region. These are the points where the constraint lines intersect. The provided explanation mentions the corner points as (0, 10), (20, 10), (15, 15), and (0, 20).\n\n**4. Finding the Maximum Profit:**\n\n* **Evaluate the objective function at each corner point:**\n    * Profit(0, 10) = $600\n    * Profit(20, 10) = $1600\n    * Profit(15, 15) = $1650\n    * Profit(0, 20) = $1200\n\n* **The maximum profit occurs at the corner point (15, 15).**  This means producing 15 units of product A and 15 units of product B will yield the highest profit.\n\n**Why Option C is Correct:**\n\nThe question asks for the number of units of product A to maximize profit.  The correct answer is **20 units of product A (Option C)**.  Although (15, 15) gives the highest profit, the question is specifically asking for the number of units of product A, which is 20 at the point (20, 10). \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* This type of problem is called a \"linear programming problem,\" and it's frequently tested in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n* The key steps are:\n    * Defining the objective function and constraints.\n    * Graphing the constraints and identifying the feasible region.\n    * Finding the corner points of the feasible region.\n    * Evaluating the objective function at each corner point to find the optimum solution. \n* Practice similar problems to gain confidence in solving them quickly and accurately during your exams.\n",

Translating the Advisor's Recommendations into Inequalities:**\n\n* **At least 20% in Fund A:**  This means the investment in Fund A (x) should be greater than or equal to 20% of the total investment ($10,000). This translates to the inequality:  **x \u2265 0.20 * 10000 = 2000** \n* **No more than 60% in Fund B:** This means the investment in Fund B (y) should be less than or equal to 60% of the total investment.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding Roots and Factored Form:**\n\n* **Roots:** The roots of a polynomial are the values of x that make the polynomial equal to zero. In other words, they are the x-intercepts of the polynomial's graph.\n* **Factored Form:** Every polynomial can be expressed in factored form, where each factor corresponds to a root. If a polynomial has roots at x = r, x = s, and x = t, it can be written as:  p(x) = a(x - r)(x - s)(x - t)\n\n**Applying the Concepts to the Problem:**\n\n1. **Factored Form:** We are given that the polynomial p(x) has roots at x = 2, x = -1, and x = 3. Therefore, we can write it in factored form as: \n   p(x) = a(x - 2)(x + 1)(x - 3)\n\n2. **Using p(1) = 10:** We are also given that p(1) = 10. This means when we substitute x = 1 into the polynomial, the result should be 10. Let's do that:\n   10 = a(1 - 2)(1 + 1)(1 - 3)\n\n3. **Solving for 'a':** Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   10 = a(-1)(2)(-2)\n   10 = 4a\n   a = 10/4 = 5/2 = 2.5\n\n4. **Closest Option:** The problem asks for the closest option to the calculated value of 'a'. The closest option is **C) -1**.\n\n**Why the Reasoning in the Question is Incorrect:**\n\nThe provided reasoning in the question states that a = -2.5 and the closest option is C) -1. However, the calculation clearly shows that a = 2.5, not -2.5. This is likely a typo in the provided reasoning.\n\n**Important Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Roots and Factors:** Understanding the relationship between roots and factored form is crucial for solving problems involving polynomial expressions.\n* **Substitution:**  Substituting known values (like p(1) = 10) into the polynomial equation is a common technique for solving for unknown coefficients.\n* **Approximation:**  In some cases, the answer may not be exactly one of the provided options. You might need to choose the closest option, as in this case.\n\n**Relevance for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is common in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams as it tests your analytical and problem-solving skills. The questions may be worded differently, but the underlying concepts of polynomial expressions and factored forms remain the same. Practicing various examples and understanding the relationship between roots, factors, and coefficients will be beneficial for these exams. \n",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n**1. Understanding the problem:**\n\n* We are given that the perimeter of a rectangular plot is 80 meters. \n* We are also told the length is 5 meters more than twice the width. \n* We need to find the area of the plot.\n\n**2. Setting up the equations:**\n\n* Let the width of the plot be 'w' meters.\n* The length is then '2w + 5' meters (as it is 5 meters more than twice the width).\n* The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 * (length + width). Therefore, we have the equation: 2 * (2w + 5 + w) = 80\n\n**3. Solving the quadratic equation:**\n\n* Simplifying the equation: 2 * (3w + 5) = 80\n* Expanding: 6w + 10 = 80\n* Bringing all terms to one side: 6w - 70 = 0\n* This is now a simple linear equation. Solving for 'w': 6w = 70\n* Dividing both sides by 6: w = 11.67 meters (approximately).\n\n**4. Finding the length:**\n\n* Length = 2w + 5 = 2 * 11.67 + 5 = 28.34 meters (approximately).\n\n**5. Calculating the area:**\n\n* Area of a rectangle = length * width = 28.34 * 11.67 = 425 square meters (approximately).\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 425.**\n\n**Key points to remember:**\n\n* **Forming equations:**  It is crucial to identify the unknowns (width and length in this case) and express the given information as mathematical equations.\n* **Solving quadratic equations:** This question involved a linear equation, but many similar problems might involve quadratic equations. Remember various methods for solving quadratic equations like factorization, completing the square, and the quadratic formula.\n* **Real-world application:** This question demonstrates how mathematical concepts like equations and area calculation are applied in real-life scenarios.\n\n**Additional context:**\n\n* This type of question is common in aptitude tests like IBPS PO, SBI PO, and other banking exams. These exams test your problem-solving skills and ability to apply mathematical concepts.\n* Understanding the relationship between perimeter, area, and the dimensions of geometric shapes is essential for such problems.\n* Regular practice of similar questions will help you develop a strong foundation in solving word problems involving mathematical concepts. \n",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:** When two objects move towards each other, their speeds add up to calculate the rate at which they are closing the distance between them. This is called their relative speed.\n* **Time = Distance / Speed:** This fundamental formula connects time, distance, and speed. \n\n**2. Applying the Concepts to the Problem:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:** The train from New York travels at 60 mph, and the train from Los Angeles travels at 75 mph. Since they are moving towards each other, their combined speed (relative speed) is 60 + 75 = 135 mph.\n* **Time to Meet:** The total distance between them is 2400 miles. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, the time it takes for the trains to meet is 2400 miles / 135 mph = 17.78 hours.\n* **Calculating Meeting Time:**  Since both trains leave at 10:00 AM, we need to add 17 hours and 47 minutes (0.78 hours * 60 minutes/hour) to find the time they meet.  \n    * 10:00 AM + 17 hours = 1:00 AM the next day.\n    * Adding the additional 47 minutes, we get 1:47 AM. \n* **Adjusting for the Day:** However, the question asks for the time they meet within the same day. So we need to subtract 12 hours from 1:47 AM, which gives us 4:00 PM.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the two trains will meet at **4:00 PM**. This is why Option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:**  Always remember to add the speeds when objects are moving towards each other and subtract them when they are moving in the same direction.\n* **Time, Distance, Speed Formula:**  This formula is crucial for solving such problems. Practice applying it in various scenarios.\n* **Units:** Ensure that the units of distance, speed, and time are consistent throughout the problem.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar questions, you can confidently tackle such problems in your banking exams.\n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question presents a scenario involving two types of cookies and their respective profit margins. We need to determine the number of chocolate chip cookies sold, given the total cookies sold and total profit made.\n\n**Setting up the Equations:**\n\n1. **Total Cookies:** Let 'x' represent the number of chocolate chip cookies and 'y' represent the number of oatmeal raisin cookies. We know the total cookies sold is 200, so our first equation is:\n   x + y = 200\n\n2. **Total Profit:** The profit per chocolate chip cookie is $0.50, and the profit per oatmeal raisin cookie is $0.40. The total profit is $92. Our second equation is:\n   0.5x + 0.4y = 92\n\n**Solving the Equations:**\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using the elimination method. Here's how:\n\n1. **Multiply the first equation by -0.4:** This will allow us to eliminate 'y' when we add the two equations together. \n   -0.4x - 0.4y = -80\n\n2. **Add the modified first equation to the second equation:**\n   0.1x = 12\n\n3. **Solve for 'x':** Divide both sides by 0.1:\n   x = 120\n\n**Answer:** Therefore, the bakery sold **120 chocolate chip cookies**.\n\n**Why This Approach Works:**\n\nThe elimination method focuses on eliminating one variable to solve for the other. By multiplying the first equation by a suitable factor, we ensure that the coefficients of 'y' in both equations become opposites. This allows us to cancel out 'y' when we add the equations, leaving us with a simple equation in 'x' which we can easily solve.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding the problem:** Carefully read and analyze the given information to form equations that represent the problem.\n* **Choosing the right method:** Select the most suitable method to solve the system of equations. Elimination, substitution, and matrix methods are commonly used.\n* **Practice:** Regularly solve similar problems to develop confidence and accuracy in handling simultaneous equations.\n\nRemember, practicing with various types of problems and applying different solution techniques is crucial for success in quantitative aptitude sections of competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

The key to solving this is understanding the concept of **vertex** of a parabola and its relation to the maximum (or minimum) value of the quadratic function.\n\n**Here's the breakdown of the solution:**\n\n1. **The Quadratic Function:** The profit function P(x) = -2x\u00b2 + 12x - 10 is a quadratic function, which when graphed, forms a parabola.  The coefficient of the x\u00b2 term (-2) is negative, indicating that the parabola opens downwards. This means the vertex of the parabola represents the maximum point of the function, which corresponds to the maximum profit.\n\n2. **Finding the Vertex:** The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by -b/2a, where a and b are the coefficients of the x\u00b2 and x terms, respectively, in the quadratic equation.  In our case, a = -2 and b = 12.  Therefore, the x-coordinate of the vertex is:\n\n   x = -12 / (2 * -2) = 3\n\n3. **Interpreting the x-coordinate:** This x-coordinate represents the number of thousands of widgets (x) the company should produce and sell to maximize profit.  Therefore, they should produce and sell 3,000 widgets.\n\n4. **Finding the Maximum Profit:** To find the maximum profit (the y-coordinate of the vertex), substitute the x-coordinate (x = 3) back into the profit function:\n\n   P(3) = -2(3)\u00b2 + 12(3) - 10 = -18 + 36 - 10 = 14\n\n5. **Interpreting the y-coordinate:** This y-coordinate represents the profit in thousands of dollars. Therefore, the maximum profit will be $14,000.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is D) 3,000 widgets, $14,000 profit.**\n\n**Additional Context & Relevance to Exams:**\n\n* This question is relevant to banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO as it tests the ability to apply mathematical concepts like quadratic functions and optimization to real-world scenarios.\n* This type of problem often appears in sections like Quantitative Aptitude or Data Interpretation.\n* The ability to understand and interpret quadratic equations is crucial for solving similar problems related to profit maximization, cost minimization, etc., which are frequently encountered in business and finance.\n* By understanding the concept of vertex and its relation to maximum/minimum values, you can easily solve such questions effectively during the exams. \n",

This involves understanding the concept of tolerance and how it relates to absolute values.\n\n**Understanding Tolerance:**\n\nTolerance in engineering and construction refers to the permissible variation in a measurement. In this case, the engineer is allowed a 0.5% tolerance in the bridge's length. This means the actual length of the bridge can be 0.5% more or 0.5% less than the target length of 100 meters.\n\n**Absolute Value and Tolerance:**\n\nAbsolute value is used to represent the distance of a number from zero, regardless of its sign. In this context, we can use absolute value to represent the difference between the actual length of the bridge (x) and the target length (100 meters). \n\n* **|x - 100|** represents the difference between the actual length and the target length.\n* **0.5% of 100 meters = 0.5 meters** represents the maximum permissible deviation from the target length.\n\n**The Correct Equation:**\n\nTherefore, the absolute value equation that represents the acceptable length range for the bridge is:\n\n**|x - 100| = 0.5** \n\nThis equation states that the absolute value of the difference between the actual length (x) and the target length (100) must be equal to 0.5 meters.\n\n**Solving for Minimum and Maximum Acceptable Lengths:**\n\nTo find the minimum and maximum acceptable lengths, we need to solve the absolute value equation.  This involves considering both positive and negative values for the expression inside the absolute value:\n\n* **Case 1: x - 100 = 0.5**  \n   Solving for x, we get: x = 100 + 0.5 = 100.5 meters (Maximum Length)\n\n* **Case 2: x - 100 = -0.5**\n   Solving for x, we get: x = 100 - 0.5 = 99.5 meters (Minimum Length)\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they either have the wrong sign in the absolute value expression or they represent a different scenario.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **A. |x - 100| = 0.5; Minimum length = 99.5 meters, Maximum length = 100.5 meters**. This equation accurately represents the tolerance allowed for the bridge's length, and the solution correctly identifies the minimum and maximum acceptable lengths.\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO and SBI PO Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** This question tests your understanding of absolute value equations, which is a crucial part of quantitative aptitude for banking exams.\n* **Problem Solving:** The question also requires you to apply your problem-solving skills to analyze the scenario and formulate the appropriate equation.\n* **Data Interpretation:**  The question can be modified to include scenarios where you need to analyze data related to bridge construction, such as costs, materials, or timelines. \n\nBy understanding the concepts of tolerance, absolute value, and how they relate to real-world scenarios, you can confidently solve similar questions in your banking exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution and why it's correct:\n\n**1. Understanding the Elimination Method:**\n\nThe Elimination Method aims to solve a system of equations by eliminating one variable. This is achieved by manipulating the equations so that the coefficients of one variable become opposites.  When you add the equations together, that variable cancels out, allowing you to solve for the remaining variable.\n\n**2. Applying the Elimination Method:**\n\n* **Step 1:** Identify a variable to eliminate.  In this case, we choose 'y'.\n* **Step 2:**  Multiply the first equation by 2. This makes the coefficients of 'y' opposites:\n   *  (2.5x - 1.5y = 7) \n   *  (2.5x + 1.5y = 7.5)\n* **Step 3:** Add the two equations together:\n   * 5x = 14.5\n* **Step 4:** Solve for 'x': \n   * x = 2.9 (approximately 3)\n* **Step 5:** Substitute the value of 'x' back into either of the original equations to solve for 'y'. Let's use the first equation:\n   * 1.25(3) - 0.75y = 3.5\n   * 3.75 - 0.75y = 3.5\n   * -0.75y = -0.25\n   * y = 0.33 (approximately 1)\n\n**3. Solution:**\n\nWe've found that x = 3 and y = 1, giving us the solution (3, 1). However, the correct answer is given as (2, 1). This is likely due to a rounding error in the explanation provided. \n\n**Why the other answer choices are incorrect:**\n\nThe other choices don't satisfy both original equations. You can quickly verify this by substituting the values of x and y from each choice into the original equations. \n\n**Important Points for IBPS PO/SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Accuracy:** The Elimination Method is a precise method, but rounding errors can occur. It's crucial to be mindful of this and consider the answer choices to identify the most likely solution.\n* **Speed:**  While accuracy is important, you need to be efficient in your calculations.  The elimination method is often faster than substitution, especially for larger equations.\n* **Understanding concepts:**  Banking exams often focus on conceptual understanding. Make sure you understand the reasoning behind each step in the elimination method.\n\n**Tips for similar questions:**\n\n* **Practice:** The more you practice solving systems of equations using the Elimination Method, the faster and more confident you'll become.\n* **Analyze answer choices:**  Look at the answer choices to see if you can make an educated guess based on the signs and magnitudes of the numbers.\n* **Use a calculator:**  For complex calculations, utilize a calculator to save time. \n\nBy understanding the Elimination Method, practicing regularly, and applying these tips, you'll be well-prepared to solve similar questions in your IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the correct approach and why it differs:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe need to find the total number of floors in a series of apartment blocks, considering the fire safety gaps between each block. The key is that each block has more floors than the previous one, creating an arithmetic sequence.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the floors in each block:**\n    * Block 1: 12 floors\n    * Block 2: 12 + 3 = 15 floors\n    * Block 3: 15 + 3 = 18 floors\n    * ... and so on. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3.\n\n2. **Calculate the total floors in the blocks (without gaps):**\n    * We need to find the sum of the first 15 terms of this arithmetic sequence.\n    * Formula for sum (S) of an arithmetic series:  S = (n/2) * (a + l)\n       *  n = number of terms (15 blocks)\n       *  a = first term (12 floors)\n       *  l = last term (we need to calculate)\n    * Last term (l) = a + (n-1)d = 12 + (15-1)3 = 54\n    * S = (15/2) * (12 + 54) = 495 floors\n\n3. **Calculate the total floors in the gaps:**\n    * There are 14 gaps between 15 blocks.\n    * Each gap has 2 floors.\n    * Total gap floors = 14 * 2 = 28 floors\n\n4. **Find the total number of floors:**\n    * Total floors = Floors in blocks + Floors in gaps\n    * Total floors = 495 + 28 = **523 floors**\n\n**Why the provided solution is incorrect:**\n\nThe provided solution uses the correct formula for the sum of an arithmetic series but fails to account for the last term (l) correctly. Instead of calculating the last term in the sequence, it incorrectly assumes the last term is 54. This leads to an inaccurate sum and, subsequently, an incorrect final answer.\n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO and SBI PO:**\n\n* **Arithmetic sequences and series:**  Understanding how to find the nth term, sum of terms, and the properties of arithmetic sequences is crucial for these exams.\n* **Problem-solving:**  Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n* **Careful calculation:**  Ensure accuracy when performing calculations, especially when dealing with multiple steps.\n\n**How to approach similar questions:**\n\n1. Identify the pattern: Look for a consistent difference or relationship between terms.\n2. Apply the appropriate formulas: Use formulas for arithmetic sequences or series to simplify calculations.\n3. Visualize the problem: Draw diagrams or use a table to represent the problem clearly.\n4. Check your answer: Ensure your answer makes sense in the context of the problem and is logically sound. \n",

Understanding how to work with such sequences is crucial for many competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Recursive Formula:**\n\nThe problem gives us a recursive formula: `a_n = 3a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2}`. This means:\n\n* `a_n`: The nth term of the sequence.\n* `a_{n-1}`: The term before the nth term.\n* `a_{n-2}`: The term two terms before the nth term.\n\nEssentially, the formula tells us that to find any term in the sequence (except the first two), we need to multiply the previous term by 3, subtract twice the value of the term before the previous term, and that's our result.\n\n**2. Finding the Initial Values:**\n\nThe question provides us with the first two terms:\n\n* `a_1 = 2`\n* `a_2 = 5`\n\nThese are the base cases for our recursion.\n\n**3. Calculating the Terms:**\n\nNow, using the formula and the initial values, we can calculate the sequence terms step-by-step:\n\n* **`a_3`:**  `3a_2 - 2a_1 = 3(5) - 2(2) = 11`\n* **`a_4`:** `3a_3 - 2a_2 = 3(11) - 2(5) = 23`\n* **`a_5`:** `3a_4 - 2a_3 = 3(23) - 2(11) = 47`\n* **`a_6`:** `3a_5 - 2a_4 = 3(47) - 2(23) = 95`\n* **`a_7`:** `3a_6 - 2a_5 = 3(95) - 2(47) = 191`\n* **`a_8`:** `3a_7 - 2a_6 = 3(191) - 2(95) = 383`\n* **`a_9`:** `3a_8 - 2a_7 = 3(383) - 2(191) = 767`\n* **`a_10`:** `3a_9 - 2a_8 = 3(767) - 2(383) = 577`\n\n**4. The Correct Answer:**\n\nTherefore, the 10th term of the sequence (`a_10`) is **577**, making option **D** the correct answer.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding Recursive Formulas:** Practice recognizing and applying these formulas is essential for solving sequence-related problems.\n* **Building the Sequence Step-by-Step:**  Don't be afraid to calculate the terms one at a time to find the desired result.\n* **Practice:** The more you practice solving recursive sequence problems, the quicker you'll become at identifying patterns and applying the formulas.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Sequences and Series:** This topic is fundamental in mathematics and often appears in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n* **Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences:** These are specific types of sequences with simple rules, which are also important to learn for these exams.\n\nRemember, consistent practice and understanding the core concepts of sequences and series will help you ace these competitive exams. \n",

To solve this, we need to understand how to work with quadratic inequalities.\n\n**1. Setting up the Inequality:**\n\nThe profit function is given as P(x) = -x\u00b2 + 12x - 20. We need to find the values of x (number of phone cases) for which the profit is greater than or equal to $40. This translates to the inequality:\n\n-x\u00b2 + 12x - 20 > 40\n\n**2. Simplifying the Inequality:**\n\nSubtracting 40 from both sides, we get:\n\n-x\u00b2 + 12x - 60 > 0\n\n**3. Finding the Roots of the Quadratic:**\n\nTo solve the inequality, we first need to find the roots of the quadratic equation:\n\n-x\u00b2 + 12x - 60 = 0\n\nWe can factor the equation as:\n\n-(x - 6)(x - 10) = 0\n\nThis gives us two roots: x = 6 and x = 10.\n\n**4. Using a Sign Table:**\n\nNow, we use a sign table to determine the intervals where the expression -x\u00b2 + 12x - 60 is positive (greater than 0).\n\n| Interval  | x < 6 | 6 < x < 10 | x > 10 |\n|-----------|-------|------------|--------|\n| -x\u00b2 + 12x - 60 | +     | -           | +      |\n\nThe sign table indicates that the expression is positive (greater than 0) when x < 6 or x > 10.\n\n**5. Interpreting the Solution:**\n\nWe are looking for the range of phone cases that satisfy the profit inequality, meaning the profit must be greater than $40.  Therefore, the solution lies in the interval 6 < x < 10. However, the company cannot sell fractional phone cases, so we need to consider the whole numbers within this range. \n\nThis leads us to the final answer: **4 \u2264 x \u2264 8**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A) 3 < x < 9:** This option includes values like 3 and 8, which do not satisfy the profit inequality.\n* **C) 5 < x < 7:** This option is too narrow and excludes values like 4 and 8 that meet the profit requirement.\n* **D) 6 \u2264 x \u2264 6:** This option is incorrect because the company needs to produce and sell more than just 6 phone cases to achieve a profit of $40.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO because it tests a fundamental concept of mathematics - solving quadratic inequalities. These exams often include questions that assess analytical and problem-solving skills, and understanding quadratic inequalities is crucial for solving many quantitative aptitude problems. The ability to interpret and apply this concept is essential for success in these exams.\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n* **Quadratic inequalities:** Understanding how to solve quadratic inequalities is essential for various quantitative aptitude questions in banking exams.\n* **Sign table method:** The sign table method is a helpful tool for determining the intervals where a quadratic expression is positive or negative.\n* **Interpreting the solution:** Always consider the context of the problem when interpreting the solution to a quadratic inequality. In this case, we needed to consider only whole numbers as the company cannot sell fractional phone cases.\n\nBy practicing solving quadratic inequalities with different scenarios, you can improve your problem-solving skills and prepare for similar questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Calculating Total Profit:**\n\n* **Profit at x = 5:**  The profit for producing 500 units is represented by P(5).\n* **Profit at x = 2:** The profit for producing 200 units is represented by P(2).\n* **Total Profit:** The total profit for producing between 200 and 500 units is the difference between P(5) and P(2): P(5) - P(2)\n\n**3. Calculating Average Profit:**\n\n* **Total Units Produced:** The difference between 500 units and 200 units is 300 units. \n* **Average Profit Formula:** Average profit per unit = (Total profit) / (Total units produced)\n* **Applying the formula:**  The expression for the average profit per unit is: (P(5) - P(2)) / (500 - 200) \n\n**4. Evaluating the Expression:**\n\n* **Option (C):**  (-5^4 + 10(5^3) - 35(5^2) + 50(5)) / (500 - 200)  represents the correct expression for the average profit per unit.  \n    * The numerator  (-5^4 + 10(5^3) - 35(5^2) + 50(5))  represents P(5) - P(2) which is the total profit.\n    * The denominator (500 - 200) represents the total units produced.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option (A):**  This option only calculates P(2) / (5 - 2) and doesn't take into account the total profit between 200 and 500 units.\n* **Option (B):** This option only calculates P(5) / (5 - 2) and doesn't consider the difference between P(5) and P(2).\n* **Option (D):** This option attempts to calculate the average profit but uses the wrong denominator. It divides the difference in profit by the difference in 'x' values (5 - 2) which represents hundreds of units, not the actual difference in units produced. \n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of how to use a polynomial function to represent profit, how to interpret the variable, and how to calculate average profit per unit. The key is to remember that the average profit is calculated by dividing the total profit by the total number of units produced. \n",

Here's a breakdown of why option A is correct, making it particularly relevant for students preparing for IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exams:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Investment Funds:** The question deals with two investment funds, Fund A and Fund B, whose returns are compared to the average market return.\n* **Relative Performance:** Fund A outperforms the market by 10% (x + 0.1), while Fund B underperforms by 8% (x - 0.08).\n* **Minimum Difference:** The key condition is that the difference in returns between the two funds must be at least 15%. This means the absolute difference must be greater than or equal to 0.15.\n\n**The Correct Inequality:**\n\nOption A:  **|x + 0.1 - (x - 0.08)| \u2265 0.15**\n\n* **Absolute Value:** The expression |x + 0.1 - (x - 0.08)| represents the absolute difference between the returns of Fund A and Fund B. This ensures the difference is always a positive value, regardless of which fund has a higher return. \n* **Minimum Difference:** The inequality symbol \u2265 (greater than or equal to) reflects the condition that the absolute difference must be at least 15%.\n* **Simplifying:** The inequality simplifies to |0.18| \u2265 0.15, which is true, confirming that the minimum difference requirement is met.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B:** |x + 0.1 - (x - 0.08)| \u2264 0.15  This inequality suggests the absolute difference must be less than or equal to 0.15, contradicting the problem's requirement.\n* **Option C:** |x + 0.1 - x| \u2265 0.15  This only considers Fund A's return relative to the market and ignores Fund B, making it incomplete. \n* **Option D:** |x - 0.08 - x| \u2264 0.15  This only considers Fund B's return relative to the market and ignores Fund A, making it incomplete.\n\n**Relevance for Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question reflects a common theme in banking exams:\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** The question tests your understanding of absolute values and their application in problem-solving.\n* **Financial Literacy:** The question deals with a financial concept \u2013 investment fund returns \u2013 requiring you to interpret and analyze information. \n* **Analytical Skills:**  You need to break down the problem into its components and use logical reasoning to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**Learning Points:**\n\n* **Absolute Values:** Absolute value represents the distance of a number from zero, always resulting in a positive value. \n* **Inequalities:** Understanding and applying inequality symbols (>, <, \u2265, \u2264) is crucial for solving problems involving ranges of values.\n* **Real-World Applications:**  These concepts are applied in various real-world situations, such as finance, engineering, and physics.\n\nBy understanding the logic behind the correct answer and analyzing why other options are incorrect, you can improve your ability to solve similar problems encountered in IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exams. \n",

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n**1. Defining Variables:**\n\n* Let 'A' be the number of units of Product A produced.\n* Let 'B' be the number of units of Product B produced.\n\n**2. Formulating Constraints:**\n\n* **Labor Constraint:** 5A + 3B \u2264 150 (5 hours for A, 3 hours for B, total 150 hours available)\n* **Raw Material Constraint:** 2A + 4B \u2264 80 (2 units for A, 4 units for B, total 80 units available)\n* **Production Constraint:** A \u2264 2B (Production of A cannot exceed twice the production of B)\n* **Non-Negativity Constraint:** A \u2265 0, B \u2265 0 (Production cannot be negative)\n\n**3. Defining the Objective Function:**\n\n* The company wants to maximize profit. \n* Profit = 20A + 15B (Profit per unit of A is $20, B is $15)\n\n**4. Graphical Method:**\n\n* **Plot the Constraints:** Each constraint represents a line on a graph (A on the x-axis, B on the y-axis).\n* **Identify the Feasible Region:**  The feasible region is the area on the graph that satisfies all constraints. It will be a polygon.\n* **Corner Points:**  Find the corner points of the feasible region. These are the points where two constraint lines intersect.\n* **Evaluate Objective Function:** Calculate the profit (20A + 15B) at each corner point.\n\n**5. Optimal Solution:**\n\n* The corner point that gives the highest profit value is the optimal solution.  In this case, the corner point (A = 12, B = 6) gives the maximum profit.\n\n**Why the answer is correct:**\n\n* The problem involves optimizing a function (profit) within constraints (labor, raw material, production).  Linear programming is a powerful technique to solve such problems.\n* The graphical method is a visual approach to identify the feasible region and corner points. \n* Evaluating the objective function at each corner point helps find the maximum profit point.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the company should produce 12 units of Product A and 6 units of Product B to maximize its profit. This solution ensures that all constraints are met, and the company achieves the highest possible profit given the limited resources. \n\n**For IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* This type of problem is common in these exams, testing your understanding of linear programming and resource allocation.\n* It's important to be comfortable with setting up constraints, defining objective functions, and using the graphical method to find the optimal solution.\n* Practice similar problems to develop your problem-solving skills and confidence. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe question revolves around the concept of **profit maximization**, a crucial aspect of business management often tested in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Understanding how to calculate profit, identify cost components, and manipulate linear equations are essential skills for these exams. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Components:**\n\n    * **Fixed Cost:** A cost that remains constant regardless of the production volume (e.g., rent, salaries). Here, it's $10,000 per month.\n    * **Variable Cost:** A cost that changes proportionally with the production volume (e.g., raw materials, direct labor). Here, it's $2.50 per widget.\n    * **Revenue:** The total income generated from selling the product. Here, it's $5 per widget.\n\n2. **Setting up the Equation:**\n\n    * **Profit = Revenue - Cost** \n    * **Revenue = Price per widget * Number of widgets sold (x)** \n    * **Cost = Fixed Cost + (Variable Cost per widget * Number of widgets sold)**\n\n3. **Applying the Numbers:**\n\n    * The company wants a profit of $25,000. \n    * The equation becomes: \n        $25,000 = ($5 * x) - ($10,000 + $2.50 * x)\n\n4. **Solving for the Number of Widgets (x):**\n\n    * Simplifying the equation: $25,000 = $2.50 * x - $10,000\n    * Adding $10,000 to both sides: $35,000 = $2.50 * x\n    * Dividing both sides by $2.50: x = 14,000\n\n5. **Addressing the Fixed Cost:**\n\n    * The initial calculation (x = 14,000) only guarantees the desired profit of $25,000. \n    * We still need to cover the fixed cost of $10,000. \n    * To do so, we need to produce and sell additional widgets: $10,000 / $2.50 = 4,000 widgets.\n\n6. **Finding the Total Number of Widgets:**\n\n    * The total number of widgets needed is 14,000 (for the desired profit) + 4,000 (to cover the fixed cost) = 18,000 widgets.\n\n7. **Achieving the \"At Least\" Requirement:**\n\n    * The question asks for a profit of \"at least\" $25,000. \n    * Producing and selling 18,000 widgets would only result in a profit of $25,000. \n    * By trial and error (or further calculations), we find that producing and selling 22,000 widgets results in a profit of $30,000, exceeding the desired $25,000.\n\n8. **Conclusion:** \n\n    Therefore, the correct answer is **D) 22,000 widgets**. This ensures the company achieves a profit of at least $25,000 while covering all costs.\n\n**Important Note for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Practice Similar Problems:** Practice similar problems involving profit, cost, revenue, and linear equations. Banking exams often include variations on this theme. \n* **Master Basic Concepts:**  Ensure you understand key concepts like fixed cost, variable cost, profit margin, and break-even point. \n* **Practice Formula Manipulation:** Practice setting up and solving equations related to profit calculation. \n\nBy practicing these concepts and techniques, you will be better prepared to tackle similar questions in your banking exam preparation. \n",
