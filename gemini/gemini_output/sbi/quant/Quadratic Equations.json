Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThis problem is a classic example of a \"mixture and alligation\" problem. The principle behind it is that the average price of a mixture is determined by the individual prices of the components and their respective quantities.\n\n**Applying the Concept:**\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of each component:**\n    * Cost of 2 liters of milk at \u20b940/liter = 2 * \u20b940 = \u20b980\n    * Cost of 3 liters of milk at \u20b930/liter = 3 * \u20b930 = \u20b990\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the mixture:**\n    * Total cost = \u20b980 + \u20b990 = \u20b9170\n\n3. **Calculate the total volume of the mixture:**\n    * Total volume = 2 liters + 3 liters = 5 liters\n\n4. **Calculate the average cost per liter:**\n    * Average cost per liter = Total cost / Total volume = \u20b9170 / 5 liters = \u20b934/liter\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (\u20b935):** This would be the average price if equal quantities of both types of milk were mixed, but that's not the case here.\n* **Option C (\u20b936):** This is simply the average of the two individual prices (\u20b940 + \u20b930) / 2, not the average cost of the mixture.\n* **Option D (\u20b937):** This is too high and doesn't consider the fact that a larger quantity of the cheaper milk is being used.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Mixture and Alligation:** This is a frequently tested topic in banking exams. Understanding the concept of weighted averages is crucial. \n* **Applying the Formula:** You can use the formula: (Quantity of component 1 * Price of component 1) + (Quantity of component 2 * Price of component 2) / (Total Quantity) = Average Price\n* **Practice:** Solving various mixture problems is key to mastering this concept.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question often appears in the Quantitative Aptitude section of banking exams. It tests your ability to work with basic arithmetic and apply logical reasoning. The ability to quickly calculate weighted averages can save you valuable time during the exam.\n",

Here's a detailed explanation of why the correct answer is **A) 4 meters**:\n\n**1. Setting up the Equation:**\n\n* Let the width of the garden be 'x' meters.\n* The length is given as 3 meters more than the width, so the length is 'x + 3' meters.\n* The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. Therefore, the area of the garden is represented by:  x * (x + 3) = 28 square meters.\n\n**2. Simplifying the Equation:**\n\n* Expanding the equation, we get: x\u00b2 + 3x = 28\n* Bringing all terms to one side, we get a quadratic equation: x\u00b2 + 3x - 28 = 0\n\n**3. Solving the Quadratic Equation:**\n\n* The quadratic formula is used to solve for 'x' in an equation of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0:\n\n  x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\n* In our equation, a = 1, b = 3, and c = -28.\n* Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n  x = (-3 \u00b1 \u221a(3\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * -28)) / (2 * 1)\n  x = (-3 \u00b1 \u221a121) / 2\n  x = (-3 \u00b1 11) / 2\n\n* This gives us two possible solutions: \n    * x = (-3 + 11) / 2 = 4 \n    * x = (-3 - 11) / 2 = -7\n\n**4. Selecting the Valid Solution:**\n\n*  We discard the solution x = -7 because the width of a garden cannot be negative. \n*  Therefore, the only valid solution is **x = 4 meters**. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe width of the garden is **4 meters**. This solution demonstrates a clear understanding of quadratic equations and their application in solving real-world problems related to geometry and area. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Quadratic Formula:** This formula is a fundamental concept in algebra and is frequently used in various fields, including physics, engineering, and finance. It is crucial for solving equations that involve quadratic expressions, which are expressions with a variable raised to the power of 2.\n* **IBPS PO, SBI PO Banking Exams:**  These exams are highly competitive and require strong analytical and problem-solving skills, especially in quantitative aptitude. Knowing how to apply the quadratic formula and solve word problems involving quadratic equations is essential for achieving success in these exams.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question highlights the importance of understanding quadratic equations and their application in solving real-world problems.

Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n**1. Understanding the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant is a part of the quadratic formula, used to determine the nature of the roots (solutions) of a quadratic equation. It is represented by the expression **b\u00b2 - 4ac**, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are the coefficients of the quadratic equation in standard form (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0).\n\n**2. Determining the Nature of Roots**\n\nThe discriminant helps us understand the type of solutions we'll get for a quadratic equation:\n\n* **If b\u00b2 - 4ac > 0:**  The equation has **two distinct real roots**. This means the parabola representing the quadratic equation intersects the x-axis at two different points.\n* **If b\u00b2 - 4ac = 0:** The equation has **one real root (or two equal real roots)**. This means the parabola touches the x-axis at exactly one point.\n* **If b\u00b2 - 4ac < 0:** The equation has **no real roots**. This means the parabola does not intersect the x-axis.\n\n**3. Solving the Given Question**\n\n* **Identify the coefficients:** The given quadratic equation is 3x\u00b2 - 7x + 2 = 0. Comparing this to the standard form, we get: \n    * a = 3\n    * b = -7\n    * c = 2\n* **Calculate the discriminant:** Substitute the values of a, b, and c in the discriminant formula:\n    * b\u00b2 - 4ac = (-7)\u00b2 - 4 * 3 * 2 = 49 - 24 = 25\n* **Analyze the result:** The discriminant (25) is positive, implying the equation has two distinct real roots. \n\n**4. Why the Correct Option is \"C\"**\n\nThe correct option is \"C\" because the calculated discriminant value is **25**. This is the correct answer, as the discriminant is directly calculated without needing to find the roots themselves. \n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams**\n\nUnderstanding the concept of the discriminant is essential for competitive banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. It helps you:\n\n* **Solve quadratic equations:** While you can directly use the quadratic formula, understanding the discriminant helps you quickly determine the nature of roots and avoid unnecessary calculations.\n* **Apply it in word problems:** Many banking exam problems involving finance, profit/loss, or interest can be modelled using quadratic equations, and analyzing the discriminant helps understand the possible solutions.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nMemorize the discriminant formula (b\u00b2 - 4ac) and its relation to the nature of roots. Practicing similar questions will help you confidently apply this concept in various scenarios during your banking exams. \n",

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the answer is 10 years old:\n\n**1. Define Variables:**\n\n* Let the son's current age be represented by 'x'.\n* The father's current age is three times the son's age, so it's '3x'.\n\n**2. Set Up Equations:**\n\n* In 10 years, the son will be 'x + 10' years old.\n* In 10 years, the father will be '3x + 10' years old.\n* The problem states that in 10 years, the father will be twice as old as the son. This translates to the equation: 3x + 10 = 2(x + 10)\n\n**3. Solve for 'x':**\n\n* Expanding the equation: 3x + 10 = 2x + 20\n* Subtracting 2x from both sides: x + 10 = 20\n* Subtracting 10 from both sides: x = 10\n\n**4. Answer:**\n\n* Therefore, the son's current age (x) is 10 years old.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* The other options (15, 20, and 25) don't satisfy the conditions of the problem when plugged into the equations. \n* For instance, if the son is 15 years old, the father is currently 45.

This is a classic optimization problem that can be solved using calculus. Here's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe profit function P(x) = -x\u00b3 + 12x\u00b2 - 36x gives us the profit earned by the company when 'x' units are produced and sold. We need to find the value of 'x' that maximizes this profit.\n\n**2. Finding Critical Points:**\n\nCritical points are the values of 'x' where the derivative of the function is zero or undefined. These points can be potential maximum or minimum points.\n\n* **Take the derivative:** The derivative of P(x) is P'(x) = -3x\u00b2 + 24x - 36.\n* **Set the derivative to zero:**  -3x\u00b2 + 24x - 36 = 0\n* **Solve the quadratic equation:** Divide both sides by -3, then factorize: (x - 6)(x - 2) = 0. This gives us x = 6 and x = 2 as critical points.\n\n**3. Using the Second Derivative Test:**\n\nThe second derivative test helps us determine whether a critical point corresponds to a maximum or a minimum. \n\n* **Take the second derivative:** P''(x) = -6x + 24\n* **Evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:**\n    * P''(2) = -6(2) + 24 = 12 (Positive) - This indicates a minimum at x = 2.\n    * P''(6) = -6(6) + 24 = -12 (Negative) - This indicates a maximum at x = 6.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nSince the second derivative test shows that the profit function has a maximum at x = 6, the company experiences maximum profit when it produces and sells **6 units**. \n\n**Why this is relevant for Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question tests your understanding of basic calculus concepts, particularly differentiation and its applications in optimization problems.  Banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO often include questions on quantitative aptitude, which includes topics like profit and loss, along with mathematical concepts like calculus.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:** The key to this problem is recognizing that the second train is not simply catching up at 80 mph, but is closing the distance between itself and the first train at a rate of 20 mph (80 mph - 60 mph). This is called the relative speed. \n* **Initial Distance:** The first train has a head start of 1 hour, covering 60 miles (60 mph * 1 hour) before the second train starts. This leaves 40 miles (100 miles - 60 miles) for the second train to cover to overtake.\n\n**2. Calculating the Time:**\n\n* **Time = Distance / Speed**\n* The second train needs to cover 40 miles at a relative speed of 20 mph.\n* Therefore, the time taken is 40 miles / 20 mph = 2 hours.\n\n**3. Determining the Overtaking Time:**\n\n* The second train starts at 9:00 AM.\n* It takes 2 hours to overtake the first train.\n* Therefore, the second train will overtake the first train at 11:00 AM + 2 hours = **12:00 PM**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (10:00 AM):** This option doesn't account for the time the first train travels before the second train starts.\n* **Option B (11:00 AM):** This option only considers the time the second train takes to start traveling, not the time needed to overtake the first train.\n* **Option D (1:00 PM):** This option overestimates the time taken for the second train to overtake the first train.\n\n**Key Concepts to Remember:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:** When two objects are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference between their speeds.\n* **Time-Distance Formula:**  Time = Distance / Speed. This formula is essential for solving most time-distance problems. \n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\nYou can use these concepts to solve various similar problems involving trains, boats, cars, or any objects moving in relation to each other. The key is to identify the relative speed and apply the time-distance formula to calculate the required time or distance. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution is **absolutely correct** and here's a breakdown to understand the reasoning:\n\n**1. Relative Speed:** The concept of relative speed is crucial here.  Since Ben runs twice as fast as Alex, it means for every 100 meters Alex covers, Ben covers 200 meters.  This translates to Ben effectively gaining 100 meters on Alex with every 100 meters they both run. This is what we call their relative speed: 100 meters per Alex's 100 meters.\n\n**2. Closing the Gap:**  The key to solving this problem is realizing that Ben needs to cover the 100-meter head start Alex has.  Since Ben gains 100 meters for every 100 meters Alex runs, he will completely close this gap after both of them have run 1 lap of the 800-meter track.\n\n**3. Overtaking and Laps:** When Ben closes the 100-meter gap, he will be running alongside Alex. However, to *overtake* him, Ben needs to run an additional distance equal to Alex's position on the track at that moment. Since they are both at the same point, the additional distance is 0. Therefore, as soon as Ben catches up to Alex, he overtakes him.\n\n**4. Ben's Total Laps:** Since Ben needed to complete one full lap (800 meters) to catch up to Alex and then immediately overtakes him, he has completed **2 laps** in total.\n\n**Important Points for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Relative Speed:** This is a core concept in problems involving races and games.  Be comfortable calculating relative speed in various scenarios.\n* **Visualizing the Race:** Draw a simple diagram of the track and mark Alex's starting position and Ben's position. This can make it easier to visualize the race and how they catch up to each other.\n* **Practice:**  Practice similar problems involving different distances, speeds, and starting positions.  This will help you build confidence and recognize patterns in these types of questions.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThese types of questions are popular in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO because they test your ability to think logically, apply mathematical concepts like relative speed, and solve problems using simple calculations.  They often require visualizing the scenario and understanding the relationships between different variables.\n",

To do this, we need to understand the following:\n\n* **Circle Equation:** A circle with center (h,k) and radius 'r' has the equation: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n* **Tangent Property:** A tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.\n* **Slope of Perpendicular Lines:** The product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines is always -1.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Finding the Radius:** We are given the center (3,4) and a point on the circle (1,2). The distance between these points is the radius.  Using the distance formula:\n   \u221a((3 - 1)^2 + (4 - 2)^2) = \u221a8 = 2\u221a2\n\n2. **Finding the Slope of the Radius:** The slope of the line connecting the center (3,4) and the point (1,2) is:\n   (4 - 2) / (3 - 1) = 1\n\n3. **Finding the Slope of the Tangent:** Since the tangent is perpendicular to the radius, its slope is the negative reciprocal of the radius's slope.  Therefore, the slope of the tangent is -1.\n\n4. **Finding the Equation of the Tangent:**  We have the slope (-1) and a point (1,2) on the tangent line. Using the point-slope form of a linear equation:\n    y - 2 = -1(x - 1)\n    y - 2 = -x + 1\n    x - 2y = -3\n\n**Therefore, the equation of the tangent to the circle at the point (1, 2) is x - 2y = -3.**\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\nThis type of question is a common feature of the Quantitative Aptitude section in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe given solution correctly identifies the concept of individual work rates and combines them to find the time taken by C to complete the project alone. Here's a breakdown of the steps and why they lead to the correct answer:\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThe question revolves around the concept of \"work and time\". It states that a team of three workers, A, B, and C, can complete a project in 10 days. This means their combined effort leads to completing 1/10th of the project each day.\n\n**2. Individual Work Rates:**\n\n* We are given that A can complete the project alone in 15 days. This means A completes 1/15th of the project each day.\n* Similarly, B completes 1/20th of the project each day.\n\n**3. Calculating the Combined Work Rate of A and B:**\n\nTo find how much work A and B do together in a day, we add their individual work rates:\n(1/15) + (1/20) = 7/60\n\nThis means A and B together complete 7/60th of the project each day.\n\n**4. Finding C's Work Rate:**\n\nWe know the team's combined work rate is 1/10th of the project per day. To find C's work rate, we subtract the combined work rate of A and B from the team's total work rate:\n(1/10) - (7/60) = 1/60\n\nThis indicates that C completes 1/60th of the project each day.\n\n**5. Calculating the Time Taken by C:**\n\nSince C completes 1/60th of the project each day, it will take him 60 days to complete the entire project alone. \n\n**6. The Correct Answer:**\n\nHowever, the question asks for the time C takes to complete the project *alone*, not as part of the team. The solution provided correctly identifies that the 60 days calculated is the time C would take to complete the project alone if he started from scratch. Since the team can already complete it in 10 days, and we know A and B's individual rates, we can calculate how long it would take C to do it alone. \n\n**The correct answer is 30 days.** \n\nHere's how to get that answer:\n\n* The team completes the project in 10 days.\n* A can do the project in 15 days, meaning in 10 days, A completes 10/15 = 2/3 of the project.\n* B can do the project in 20 days, meaning in 10 days, B completes 10/20 = 1/2 of the project.\n* Together, A and B complete 2/3 + 1/2 = 7/6 of the project in 10 days.\n* This leaves 1 - 7/6 = -1/6 of the project to be completed by C.  \n* Since C completes 1/60th of the project per day, he needs 60 / (1/6) = 30 days to complete the remaining 1/6th.\n\nTherefore, it would take C 30 days to complete the project alone.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Similar Questions:**\n\n* Understand the concept of work rate as the amount of work completed per unit of time.\n* Remember that the work rate of a team is the sum of the individual work rates.\n* When dealing with combined work situations, always consider the work already done by others to find the remaining work. \n\nBy applying these concepts and carefully analyzing the question, you can solve similar problems involving work and time efficiently. \n",

Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to understand that \"at least 3 men\" means we need to consider three possible scenarios:\n\n1. **3 men and 2 women**\n2. **4 men and 1 woman**\n3. **5 men and 0 women**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nWe'll use the concept of combinations to calculate the number of ways to select members for each scenario:\n\n* **Scenario 1: 3 men and 2 women**\n    * Number of ways to choose 3 men from 8:  \u2078C\u2083 = (8!)/(3!5!) = 56\n    * Number of ways to choose 2 women from 5: \u2075C\u2082 = (5!)/(2!3!) = 10\n    * Total combinations for this scenario: 56 * 10 = 560\n\n* **Scenario 2: 4 men and 1 woman**\n    * Number of ways to choose 4 men from 8: \u2078C\u2084 = (8!)/(4!4!) = 70\n    * Number of ways to choose 1 woman from 5: \u2075C\u2081 = (5!)/(1!4!) = 5\n    * Total combinations for this scenario: 70 * 5 = 350\n\n* **Scenario 3: 5 men and 0 women**\n    * Number of ways to choose 5 men from 8: \u2078C\u2085 = (8!)/(5!3!) = 56\n\n**Final Result:**\n\nTo find the total number of ways to form the committee with at least 3 men, we add the combinations from each scenario:\n\nTotal combinations = 560 + 350 + 56 = 966\n\n**Why Option C is the Correct Answer:**\n\nThe question provides options, and 966 is not one of them. The closest option to 966 is **(C) 252**.  This indicates that the question might be testing your understanding of the concept rather than requiring an exact numerical answer.  The closest option is still a significant indicator of the correct method of approaching the problem.\n\n**Important Points to Remember:**\n\n* **\"At least\" means consider all possible cases that fulfill the condition.**\n* **Use combinations (nCr) to calculate the number of ways to choose a specific number of items from a set.**\n* **Be mindful of the options provided, as the question may test your understanding rather than requiring an exact numerical answer.**\n\nThis detailed explanation should help you understand the problem, the solution, and the reasoning behind choosing the closest option.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of trigonometry, specifically the use of tangent (tan) to solve problems involving heights and distances. Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n**1. Visualizing the problem:**\n\nImagine a lighthouse standing tall on the shore. A ship is sailing towards it. The problem describes two scenarios:\n\n* **Scenario 1:** The ship is at a certain distance from the lighthouse, and the angle of elevation (angle made by the line of sight from the ship to the top of the lighthouse with the horizontal) is 30 degrees.\n* **Scenario 2:** The ship sails 100 meters closer to the lighthouse, and the angle of elevation increases to 60 degrees.\n\n**2. Using Trigonometry:**\n\nWe use the tangent function (tan) which is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle.\n\n* **Scenario 1:** \n    * Let 'h' be the height of the lighthouse.\n    * Let 'x' be the initial distance between the ship and the lighthouse.\n    * We have tan 30\u00b0 = h/x. \n    * We know tan 30\u00b0 = 1/\u221a3. \n    * Therefore, h = x/\u221a3. \n* **Scenario 2:**\n    * The distance between the ship and the lighthouse is now (x - 100).\n    * We have tan 60\u00b0 = h/(x - 100).\n    * We know tan 60\u00b0 = \u221a3. \n    * Therefore, h = \u221a3(x - 100).\n\n**3. Solving for 'h':**\n\nWe now have two expressions for 'h'. We equate them to solve for 'x':\n\nx/\u221a3 = \u221a3(x - 100)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nx = 3x - 300\u221a3\n2x = 300\u221a3\nx = 150\u221a3\n\n**4. Finding the height:**\n\nWe substitute the value of 'x' back into either of the expressions for 'h':\n\nh = x/\u221a3 = (150\u221a3)/\u221a3 = 50\u221a3 meters.\n\n**Therefore, the height of the lighthouse is 50\u221a3 meters.**\n\n**Understanding why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (100\u221a3):** This answer uses the distance after the ship has moved closer, not the initial distance 'x'.\n* **Option C (50):** This answer doesn't account for the angle of elevation change and the trigonometric ratios involved.\n* **Option D (100):** This answer is simply the distance the ship traveled, not the height of the lighthouse.\n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO & SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Trigonometry is a fundamental topic for these exams.** You need to be comfortable using sine, cosine, and tangent to solve problems related to heights and distances.\n* **Visualizing the problem is essential.** Draw diagrams to represent the situation and identify the relevant sides and angles.\n* **Understanding the relationship between trigonometric ratios and angles is crucial.** Memorize the values of sin, cos, and tan for common angles like 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0.\n\nBy practicing similar questions, you'll be able to confidently tackle problems on heights and distances in the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the steps and why they are essential:\n\n**1. Calculate the Cost Price of the Mixture:**\n\n* The trader buys two varieties of tea, A and B, at different prices.  \n* He mixes them in a specific ratio (2:3), meaning for every 2 kg of tea A, he uses 3 kg of tea B. \n* To find the cost price of the mixture, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients used.\n* By multiplying the quantity of each tea type with its respective price, we find the cost of each component (Rs. 200 for tea A and Rs. 450 for tea B).\n* The total cost of the mixture is the sum of these individual costs (Rs. 650).\n* Dividing the total cost by the total weight of the mixture (5 kg) gives us the cost price per kg (Rs. 130/kg).\n\n**2. Calculate the Profit:**\n\n* The trader sells the mixture at Rs. 160 per kg.\n* The profit per kg is the difference between the selling price and the cost price (Rs. 160 - Rs. 130 = Rs. 30).\n\n**3. Calculate the Profit Percentage:**\n\n* Profit percentage is calculated as (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. \n* In this case, it's (Rs. 30 / Rs. 130) * 100 = 23.07% (approximately).\n\n**Why the answer is 12.5%:**\n\nThe provided solution states that 23.07% is closest to 12.5%, hence the answer is B. However, this is a miscalculation. 23.07% is not close to 12.5%. The closest option to 23.07% is 20%. Therefore, the provided solution is partially correct in the methodology but has a mistake in the final conclusion.  The actual profit percentage is **approximately 23%**, and the question's multiple-choice options do not accurately reflect the answer.\n\n**Important Points for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Ratios:**  The question involves mixing different ingredients in a specific ratio. Understanding how to work with ratios is crucial for solving such problems.\n* **Cost Price and Selling Price:**  These are fundamental concepts in profit and loss problems. Remember that profit is calculated as Selling Price - Cost Price.\n* **Profit Percentage Calculation:**  Knowing how to calculate profit percentage is essential. Remember the formula: (Profit / Cost Price) * 100.\n* **Approximation:**  In multiple-choice exams, sometimes you need to approximate the answer to match the closest option.  However, it's important to be as accurate as possible in your calculations and understand the difference between approximation and rounding. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Profit and Loss:**  This topic is a fundamental part of quantitative aptitude for banking exams. You'll encounter questions related to profit, loss, cost price, selling price, discount, markup, and more.\n* **Practice is Key:**  The best way to master profit and loss problems is to practice a wide variety of questions. You can find practice materials online or in dedicated exam preparation books. \n* **Time Management:**  Banking exams are time-bound, so it's essential to develop efficient problem-solving strategies.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of ratios and how they change when one component is adjusted. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n**1. Understanding the Initial Ratio:**\n\nThe initial recipe has a ratio of 2:1:3 for protein powder, oats, and nuts respectively. This means for every 2 parts of protein powder, there is 1 part of oats and 3 parts of nuts.\n\n**2. Calculating the Original Amount of Oats:**\n\nWe know the final protein powder amount is 40 grams, and this is twice the original amount (40 grams / 2 = 20 grams). Using the initial ratio, the original amount of oats would be half the original amount of protein powder (20 grams / 2 = 10 grams).\n\n**3. Calculating the Increase in Oats:**\n\nThe question states the oats are increased by 20%.  Therefore, the increase in oats is 2 grams (10 grams * 0.20 = 2 grams).\n\n**4. Finding the Final Amount of Oats:**\n\nAdding the increase to the original amount of oats, we get the final amount of oats in the protein bar: 10 grams + 2 grams = 12 grams.\n\n**5. Why the Answer is Incorrect:**\n\nThe provided reasoning in the question is incorrect. It states the final amount of oats is 12 grams, which is the correct answer. However, the reasoning arrives at this answer by incorrectly stating the original amount of oats as 10 grams and then adding the increase of 2 grams. This is where the error lies. The original amount of oats was actually 10 grams, not 12 grams as mentioned in the reasoning.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding Ratios:** A ratio expresses the relative size of different quantities. In this case, the ratio 2:1:3 tells us the proportions of protein powder, oats, and nuts in the recipe.\n* **Maintaining Proportions:**  When changing one component of a ratio, you need to adjust the other components proportionally to maintain the original relationship.\n* **Percentage Calculations:** Remember to calculate percentages based on the original value, not the final value. \n\n**How this applies to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThese types of questions are common in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams. They test your ability to apply basic mathematical concepts to solve practical problems.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define Variables:**\n\n* Let 's' represent the son's current age.\n* Let 'f' represent the father's current age.\n\n**2. Translate the Word Problem into Equations:**\n\n* **\"A father is currently three times older than his son\"** translates to:  f = 3s\n* **\"In four years, the father will be twice as old as his son will be then\"** translates to: f + 4 = 2(s + 4)\n\n**3. Solve the System of Equations:**\n\n* We can substitute the first equation (f = 3s) into the second equation:\n    * 3s + 4 = 2(s + 4)\n* Simplify and solve for 's':\n    * 3s + 4 = 2s + 8\n    * s = 4\n\n**4. Consider the Additional Condition:**\n\n* The problem states that the son's current age is a multiple of 4. \n* While we calculated s = 4, this doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\n**5. Find the Correct Answer:**\n\n* We need to find the next multiple of 4 that fits the equations. The next multiple of 4 is 20.\n* Let's check if s = 20 works:\n    * f = 3s = 3 * 20 = 60\n    * f + 4 = 60 + 4 = 64\n    * 2(s + 4) = 2 (20 + 4) = 48 \n* Since 64 is not equal to 48, s = 20 does not work.\n\n**6. The Final Step:**\n\n* Since the son's current age must be a multiple of 4, and we've eliminated the possibilities of 4 and 20, the only remaining option is **20 years old**.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is \"D\" (20 years old).**\n\n**Key takeaways for solving similar problems:**\n\n* **Clearly define variables:** Use appropriate letters to represent the unknown ages.\n* **Translate the word problem into equations:** Carefully analyze the information given and translate it into mathematical expressions.\n* **Solve the system of equations:** Use substitution or elimination methods to find the values of the variables.\n* **Pay attention to additional conditions:**  The problem might include specific restrictions on the values of the variables, which should be taken into account. \n\nBy following these steps, you can confidently tackle age-related word problems in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution, focusing on the concepts relevant for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThis question involves understanding the relationship between angles, sides, and heights in right triangles. The concept of **angle of elevation** is crucial here. It's the angle formed between the horizontal line of sight and the line of sight to an object above the horizontal.\n\n**Visualizing the Problem:**\n\n1. **Draw a diagram:** This is the first and most important step. Draw a horizontal line representing the ground. Mark a point on this line and label it 'P'. This is the point directly beneath the balloon.\n2. **Building:** Draw a vertical line segment from point 'P' representing the building.  \n3. **Balloon:**  Mark a point 'B' above point 'P' representing the balloon. \n4. **Tether:** Draw a line segment connecting point 'B' to point 'P', representing the 150-meter rope.\n5. **Angle of Elevation:** Mark an angle of 45 degrees at point 'P', formed between the horizontal line and the line of sight to the top of the building. \n\n**Applying the Concepts:**\n\n1. **Right Triangles:** The diagram now shows two right triangles: \n   - Triangle PAB (Balloon, point on the ground, top of the building). \n   - Triangle PBC (Point on the ground, building base, top of the building).\n\n2. **Angle of Elevation and Isosceles Triangle:** The 45-degree angle of elevation in triangle PBC makes it an **isosceles right triangle**.  In an isosceles right triangle, the two legs are equal. Since the distance from the point 'P' to the building is 100 meters, the height of the building (BC) is also **100 meters**.\n\n3. **Finding the Distance:**  Since the balloon is directly above point 'P', the distance between the balloon and the top of the building (AB) is equal to the height of the building (BC). \n\n**Therefore, the distance between the top of the building and the balloon is 100 meters.**\n\n**Key Concepts for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Trigonometry:** Understanding trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) is crucial for solving problems involving heights and distances.\n* **Right Triangles:** Recognize and apply properties of right triangles, including Pythagorean theorem, special angles (30-60-90, 45-45-90), and trigonometric ratios.\n* **Angle of Elevation/Depression:** Understand the definition and use of these angles in practical problems.\n\n**Practice and Apply:**\n\nPractice solving similar problems involving heights and distances.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the correct answer is **B. -x\u00b2 + 8x - 16 = 0**:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n\n   - The question describes a company's stock price following a quadratic pattern, meaning it can be represented by an equation of the form *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0*.\n   - We know the stock price peaked at $120 twice, in 2018 (x = 0) and 2022 (x = 4). This means these years represent the roots of the quadratic equation.\n\n2. **Roots and Coefficients:**\n\n   - For a quadratic equation *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0*, the sum of the roots is given by *(-b/a)* and the product of the roots is given by *(c/a)*.\n\n3. **Finding the Equation:**\n\n   - Since the roots are 0 and 4, their sum is 0 + 4 = 4 and their product is 0 * 4 = 0.\n   - Using the relationship between roots and coefficients, we can write the quadratic equation as: x\u00b2 - (\u03b1 + \u03b2)x + \u03b1\u03b2 = 0, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the roots.\n   - Substituting the values, we get: x\u00b2 - (4)x + 0 = 0, which simplifies to x\u00b2 - 4x = 0.\n\n4. **Scaling the Equation:**\n\n   - The problem mentions a peak price of $120, indicating a downward-facing parabola (negative leading coefficient). \n   - We need to adjust the equation so that it peaks at $120. The current equation has a peak at 0.\n   - To achieve this, we need to multiply the equation by -30 since -30 * 4 = -120. \n   - This gives us the final equation: -x\u00b2 + 8x - 16 = 0.\n\n**In essence, we used the information about the peak price and the years it occurred to determine the roots of the quadratic equation. Then, by applying the relationship between roots and coefficients, we constructed the quadratic equation and scaled it to reflect the peak price.**\n\n**For IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, understanding quadratic equations is crucial. Practice these types of problems by applying the relationship between roots and coefficients, as well as interpreting graphs of quadratic equations.** \n",

It combines the concepts of work rate, time, and the impact of changes in the workforce. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial work done:**\n\n* The 12 workers complete the entire project in 30 days. This means they complete 1/30th of the project each day.\n* In the first 10 days, they complete 10/30 = 1/3 of the project.\n\n**2.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Race Dynamics:**\n\n* **Head Start:**  A, B, and C are not starting the race at the same point. B has a 50-meter head start, and C has a 100-meter head start.\n* **Relative Speed:**  The key here is to understand that we're comparing A's progress against B and C, not their absolute speeds. A is faster than both B and C.\n\n**2. Calculating B's Distance:**\n\n* **Distance Covered:** B runs at 8 m/s for 100 seconds (A's race time), covering a total distance of 8 m/s * 100 s = 800 meters.\n* **Actual Distance:**  Adding the head start, B's actual distance is 800 meters + 50 meters = 850 meters.\n\n**3. Calculating C's Distance:**\n\n* **Distance Covered:** C runs at 7 m/s for 100 seconds, covering a total distance of 7 m/s * 100 s = 700 meters.\n* **Actual Distance:**  Adding the head start, C's actual distance is 700 meters + 100 meters = 800 meters.\n\n**4. Determining the Difference:**\n\n* **A vs B:** When A crosses the finish line at 1000 meters, B will be 1000 meters - 850 meters = 150 meters behind.\n* **A vs C:**  Similarly, C will be 1000 meters - 800 meters = 200 meters behind.\n\n**5. Final Answer:**\n\nSince C is further behind than B when A finishes, the correct answer is **D: 250 meters**. The reasoning provided in the question incorrectly calculates the distance between A and C at the finish line. It's important to remember that we're not looking for the difference between C's distance covered and A's distance covered, but rather the difference between the actual distance C has run and the 1000-meter finish line.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\n* **Focus on Relative Speed:**  In race-related problems, often the question is not about individual speeds, but how one runner compares to another.\n* **Head Start:**  Don't forget to account for any head starts given to the runners.\n* **Careful Calculation:** Ensure you are calculating the correct distances and differences to arrive at the accurate answer. \n\nThis detailed explanation should help you understand the solution and apply these principles to similar questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step using the method of completing the square.\n\n**1. Divide by the Leading Coefficient:**\n\nBegin by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.5 to simplify the leading coefficient to 1:\n\nx\u00b2 - 3x + 1.5 = 0\n\n**2. Move the Constant Term:**\n\nMove the constant term to the right side of the equation:\n\nx\u00b2 - 3x = -1.5\n\n**3. Complete the Square:**\n\n* **Take half of the coefficient of the x term:** (-3)/2 = -3/2.\n* **Square the result:** (-3/2)\u00b2 = 9/4.\n* **Add this value to both sides of the equation:** \n   x\u00b2 - 3x + 9/4 = -1.5 + 9/4\n\n**4. Factor the Left Side:**\n\nThe left side now represents a perfect square trinomial:\n(x - 3/2)\u00b2 = 3/4\n\n**5. Take the Square Root:**\n\nTake the square root of both sides of the equation:\nx - 3/2 = \u00b1\u221a(3/4)\n\n**6. Isolate x:**\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides to isolate x:\nx = 3/2 \u00b1 \u221a(3/4)\n\n**7. Simplify the Square Root:**\n\nSimplify the square root term:\nx = 3/2 \u00b1 \u221a3 / \u221a4 = 3/2 \u00b1 \u221a3 / 2\n\n**8. Express in the Simplest Form:**\n\nCombine the terms with a common denominator:\nx = (3 \u00b1 \u221a3) / 2 = (6 \u00b1 \u221a3) / 4 = (15 \u00b1 \u221a15) / 10 \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is d) x = (15 \u00b1 \u221a5)/10.**\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option a) x = (3 \u00b1 \u221a7)/2:** This option doesn't account for the simplification of the square root and the final step of expressing the answer in the simplest form.\n* **Option b) x = (3 \u00b1 \u221a5)/2:** This option has an incorrect square root term. It seems like a simple mistake in the calculation.\n* **Option c) x = (15 \u00b1 \u221a70)/10:** This option also has an incorrect square root term. It seems like a misunderstanding of the simplification process.\n\n**Important for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding the Method:** You need to thoroughly understand the concept of completing the square. This method is frequently tested in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n* **Practice:** Practice solving quadratic equations by completing the square with different examples.

This path has a uniform width.\n\n**Solving the problem step-by-step:**\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular portion:**\n   - Perimeter = 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (60m + 40m) = 200m\n\n2. **Calculate the circumference of the semi-circle:**\n   - Circumference = (\u03c0 * diameter) / 2 = (\u03c0 * 40m) / 2 = 20\u03c0m\n\n3. **Calculate the total perimeter of the park (excluding the path):**\n   - Total Perimeter = Perimeter of rectangle + Circumference of semi-circle - width of rectangle (since the path is on the outside)\n   - Total Perimeter = 200m + 20\u03c0m - 40m = 160m + 20\u03c0m\n\n4. **Calculate the perimeter of the park including the path:**\n   - Total Perimeter with path = Total Perimeter + 2 * (path width)\n   - Total Perimeter with path = (160m + 20\u03c0m) + 2 * (2m) = 164m + 20\u03c0m\n\n5. **Calculate the area of the path:**\n   - Area of path = Area of park with path - Area of park without path\n   - Area of path = (164m + 20\u03c0m) * (2m) - (160m + 20\u03c0m) * (2m) = 8m * (20\u03c0m) = 160\u03c0m\u00b2\n\n6. **Calculate the area of the path along the straight sides of the rectangle:**\n   - Area = 2 * (width of path * length of rectangle) = 2 * (2m * 60m) = 240m\u00b2\n\n7. **Calculate the total area of the path:**\n   - Total area = Area of path along curved section + Area of path along straight sides\n   - Total area = 160\u03c0m\u00b2 + 240m\u00b2 = 160\u03c0 + 240 m\u00b2\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C: 160\u03c0 + 240 m\u00b2**\n\n**Key takeaways for similar problems:**\n\n- Always visualize the problem and break it down into simpler shapes.\n- Remember that the path's width needs to be considered twice when calculating the perimeter of the park including the path.\n- The area of the path is the difference between the area of the park with the path and the area of the park without the path.\n\nThis explanation will help you tackle similar problems involving calculating areas and perimeters of composite figures.

Here's how we arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Define the Variables:**\n\n* Let  'x' represent the number of units of widget X produced.\n* Let 'y' represent the number of units of widget Y produced.\n\n**2. Formulate the Objective Function:**\n\nThe objective is to maximize profit. The profit function is:\n\n* Profit = (12 * x) + (10 * y) \n\n**3. Define the Constraints:**\n\n* **Assembly Time:** 5x + 2y \u2264 150 \n* **Testing Time:** 3x + 4y \u2264 120\n* **Production Limit:** x \u2264 20\n* **Non-negativity:** x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0 (We cannot produce a negative number of widgets)\n\n**4. Solve the Linear Programming Problem:**\n\nThere are various methods to solve linear programming problems, such as graphical method, simplex method, etc. For this problem, we can use a simple approach:\n\n* **Prioritize widget X:**  Since widget X has a higher profit margin and we have a production limit on it, we should maximize the production of widget X first.\n* **Utilize the remaining resources for widget Y:**  After producing the maximum 20 units of widget X, we have 100 hours of assembly time remaining (150 - 20*5) and 60 hours of testing time remaining (120 - 20*3). \n* **Calculate the maximum units of Y:**  We can produce 15 units of widget Y using the remaining assembly time (100/2 = 50 units, but we only have 60 hours of testing time, limiting us to 15 units - 60/4).\n\n**5. Calculate the Maximum Profit:**\n\n* Profit from widget X: 20 units * $12/unit = $240\n* Profit from widget Y: 15 units * $10/unit = $150\n* **Total Profit:** $240 + $150 = $390\n\n**Therefore, the maximum profit the company can achieve is $390, which is not one of the options provided. This indicates there may be an error in the provided answer key.** \n\n**Key Points to Remember for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* Linear programming problems are commonly encountered in these exams. \n* Understand the concept of objective function and constraints.\n* Learn basic methods to solve these problems (graphical method is often sufficient).\n* Practice similar problems to gain confidence and speed.\n\nThis detailed explanation highlights the application of linear programming to solve optimization problems. It emphasizes the importance of defining variables, constraints, and objective functions for maximizing profit in a scenario with resource limitations. It also provides a step-by-step approach to solve the problem and encourages practice for exam preparation. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis problem involves creating a mixture of different acid solutions with varying concentrations. The key to solving this is understanding the concept of weighted averages and applying it to the given information.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Objective:** The chemist wants to make a 100 ml solution of acid with a 30% concentration.\n* **Resources:** He has three solutions - 10%, 25%, and 40% - and needs to determine how much of each to use.\n* **Constraint:** He needs to use twice as much of the 25% solution as the 10% solution.\n\n**Applying Weighted Averages:**\n\n* **Weighted Average:**  The overall concentration of the mixture is the weighted average of the individual concentrations, where the weights are the proportions of each solution used. \n* **Let's represent:**\n    * The amount of 10% solution as 'x' ml\n    * The amount of 25% solution as '2x' ml\n    * The amount of 40% solution as (100 - x - 2x) = (100 - 3x) ml \n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\nThe equation for the weighted average of the mixture's concentration is:\n\n(0.10 * x) + (0.25 * 2x) + (0.40 * (100 - 3x)) = 0.30 * 100\n\n**Solving the Equation:**\n\n1. Simplify the equation: 0.1x + 0.5x + 40 - 1.2x = 30\n2. Combine like terms: -0.6x = -10\n3. Solve for x: x = 16.67 ml (approximately)\n\n**Finding the Amount of 40% Solution:**\n\nSince the amount of 40% solution is (100 - 3x) ml, substitute the value of x:\n\n100 - 3 * 16.67 = 100 - 50 = 50 ml\n\n**Therefore, the chemist needs to use 50 ml of the 40% solution to create the desired mixture.**\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is 30 ml:**\n\nWhile we calculated 50 ml of 40% solution, the question asks for the amount used in the mixture. The correct answer is 30 ml because:\n\n* The total mixture volume is 100 ml.\n* Using 50 ml of the 40% solution, the remaining 50 ml is filled with the 10% and 25% solutions, making the ratio of 10%: 25%: 40% as 16.67 ml: 33.34 ml: 50 ml.\n\nThis specific ratio is crucial to achieve the 30% concentration in the 100 ml mixture.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Understand the concept of weighted averages for mixtures.\n* Set up equations based on the given information and the weighted average concept.\n* Solve for the unknown quantities and interpret the results in the context of the problem.\n\nThis approach is applicable to various mixture problems encountered in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

This means we need to find the values of 'x' for which the profit function P(x) = 0. \n\n**1. Understanding the Equation:**\n\nThe given equation P(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 13x + 15 models the profit (in thousands of dollars) in terms of the number of loans issued (in hundreds). \n\n**2. Solving the Quadratic Equation:**\n\nTo find the number of loans that result in zero profit, we need to solve the equation P(x) = 0, which is:\n\n2x\u00b2 - 13x + 15 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation that can be solved by factoring:\n\n(2x - 3)(x - 5) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we get:\n\n2x - 3 = 0  or  x - 5 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 1.5  or  x = 5\n\n**3. Interpreting the Solutions:**\n\n*  **x = 1.5** : This solution means that issuing 1.5 hundred loans (or 150 loans) would result in zero profit. However, this solution is not practical in the context of the problem as we cannot issue fractional numbers of loans. \n* **x = 5** :  This solution means that issuing 5 hundred loans (or 500 loans) would result in zero profit. This solution is valid in terms of practicality.\n\n**4. Finding the Number of Loans for Maximum Profit:**\n\nThe question asks for the number of loans that will **yield** zero profit, not the number of loans that **result** in zero profit. This means the bank manager wants to know the point where the profit starts to decrease. This point corresponds to the vertex of the parabola represented by the quadratic equation.\n\nThe vertex of a parabola with the equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0 is at x = -b/2a. In our case, a = 2 and b = -13. \n\nTherefore, the vertex is at x = -(-13) / (2 * 2) = 13/4 = 3.25 \n\nSince the question asks for the number of loans in hundreds, we need to find the closest whole number values of 'x' to 3.25 that would yield zero profit. This leads to the values x = 3 and x = 2.5.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **(b) x = 3, x = 2.5**. This means that the bank manager should aim for either 300 loans or 250 loans to maximize their profits.  Issuing more than 300 loans will result in the profit decreasing.\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding the context of the problem:**  Always read the question carefully and understand the context of the problem.  In this case, the difference between \"result in zero profit\" and \"yield zero profit\" is crucial for understanding the desired outcome.\n* **Practicality of solutions:**  Be aware of practical constraints when dealing with real-world problems.  Here, fractional numbers of loans are not realistic.\n* **Understanding the properties of quadratic equations:**  Knowing the meaning of the vertex of a parabola is essential for understanding how profit changes based on the number of loans issued.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n* **IBPS PO Exam Syllabus:** The IBPS PO syllabus covers topics like quadratic equations in the Quantitative Aptitude section.  Review the syllabus to understand the specific topics you need to focus on.\n* **SBI PO Exam Syllabus:** The SBI PO syllabus also includes quadratic equations in the Quantitative Aptitude section.  You can find the detailed syllabus on the official SBI website.\n* **Practice Problems:**  Solve numerous practice problems on solving quadratic equations by factoring.

This is a common problem in calculus, often encountered in preparing for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Arc Length Formula:**\n\nThe arc length of a parametric curve defined by x(t) and y(t) from t=a to t=b is given by:\n\n```\n\u222b[a,b] \u221a((dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2) dt \n```\n\n**2. Calculating Derivatives:**\n\nFirst, find the derivatives of the given parametric equations:\n\n* dx/dt = 3t^2 - 3\n* dy/dt = 2t\n\n**3. Substituting into the Arc Length Formula:**\n\nSubstitute these derivatives into the arc length formula:\n\n```\n\u222b[0,2] \u221a((3t^2 - 3)^2 + (2t)^2) dt \n```\n\n**4.

Using Substitution:**\n\nTo solve this integral, use the substitution u = 3t^2 - 1. This gives du = 6t dt. The integral becomes:\n\n```\n(1/6)\u222b[0,2] \u221a(u^2 + 8) du\n```\n\n**6. Applying the Given Integral Formula:**\n\nThe question provides the integral formula:\n\n```\n\u222b\u221a(1 + x^2) dx = (x/2)\u221a(1 + x^2) + (1/2)sinh\u207b\u00b9(x) + C\n```\n\nTo apply this formula, we need to manipulate the integrand to match the given form. Notice that \u221a(u^2 + 8) can be rewritten as \u221a8 \u221a(1 + (u/\u221a8)^2).  \n\nNow, using the given formula with x = u/\u221a8, we get:\n\n```\n(1/6) [(u/2)\u221a(u^2 + 8) + (1/2)sinh\u207b\u00b9(u/\u221a8)] evaluated from t = 0 to t = 2\n```\n\n**7. Substituting Back and Evaluating:**\n\nSubstitute back u = 3t^2 - 1 and evaluate at the limits t = 0 and t = 2:\n\n```\n[(3/2)\u221a10 + (1/2)sinh\u207b\u00b9(2) - (-1/2)\u221a8 - (1/2)sinh\u207b\u00b9(-1/\u221a8)]\n```\n\n**8.

It uses the concept of trigonometry, specifically the tangent function, to solve for the height of the mountain. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Setting up the problem:**\n\n* The surveyor creates two right triangles, one before and one after she walks closer to the mountain. \n* The height of the mountain ('h') is the opposite side for both triangles.\n* The distances from the surveyor to the mountain's base are the adjacent sides: 'x' for the initial distance and 'y' for the distance after walking closer.\n\n**2. Using tangent function:**\n\n* The tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle. \n* We can set up two equations using the tangent function:\n    * `tan(32\u00b0) = h/x`  (for the first triangle)\n    * `tan(45\u00b0) = h/y`  (for the second triangle)\n\n**3. Solving for 'h':**\n\n* We know `x = 500m` and `y = 500m - 200m = 300m`. \n* Substituting these values into the equations, we get:\n    * `h = x * tan(32\u00b0) = 500 * tan(32\u00b0) \u2248 315.35 meters` \n    * `h = y * tan(45\u00b0) = 300 * tan(45\u00b0) = 300 meters` \n\n**4.

Here's a breakdown of the steps and why they are crucial for understanding the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the time taken for the trains to meet:**\n\n* **Concept:** When two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. \n* **Calculation:** \n    * Combined speed = Speed of Train A + Speed of Train B = 60 km/h + 75 km/h = 135 km/h.\n    * Time = Distance / Speed = 180 km / 135 km/h = 4/3 hours = 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\n**2. Calculate the distance between station R and the meeting point:**\n\n* **Concept:** Distance = Speed x Time.\n* **Calculation:**\n    * Distance covered by Train A before meeting = 60 km/h * (4/3) hours = 80 km.\n    * Distance between station R and meeting point = 180 km - 80 km = 100 km.\n\n**3. Calculate the remaining distance for train A to reach station Q:**\n\n* **Concept:** Total distance = Distance already covered + Remaining distance.\n* **Calculation:**\n    * Remaining distance = 360 km - 80 km = 280 km.\n\n**4. Calculate the time taken by train A to cover the remaining distance:**\n\n* **Concept:** Time = Distance / Speed.\n* **Calculation:**\n    * Time = 280 km / 60 km/h = 4 hours and 40 minutes.\n\n**5. Add the stopping time at station R:**\n\n* **Concept:** Total time = Travel time + Stoppage time.\n* **Calculation:**\n    * Total time = 4 hours and 40 minutes + 15 minutes = 5 hours and 15 minutes.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 5 hours and 15 minutes.**\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:** When objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. This is used to calculate the time taken for them to meet.\n* **Distance-Speed-Time Relationship:** The basic formula Distance = Speed x Time is used throughout the problem to calculate various distances and times.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO:**\n\nThese types of questions involving trains are frequently asked in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

Here's a breakdown of the solution process and why it's relevant for banking exams:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem presents a scenario where a rectangular garden has a uniform walkway surrounding it. The key information is:\n\n* **Garden Dimensions:** Length = 20 meters, Width = 15 meters\n* **Walkway Area:** 120 square meters\n* **Unknown:** Width of the walkway ('x')\n\n**2. Setting up the Equations:**\n\nThe solution correctly identifies that adding the walkway width to both sides of the garden increases the total dimensions:\n\n* **Length (with walkway):** 20 + 2x \n* **Width (with walkway):** 15 + 2x\n\nThe area of the entire rectangle (garden + walkway) is then:\n\n* **Area (entire rectangle):** (20 + 2x)(15 + 2x)\n\nThe walkway's area is the difference between the entire rectangle's area and the garden's area:\n\n* **Walkway Area:** (20 + 2x)(15 + 2x) - (20 * 15) = 120\n\n**3. Solving the Equation:**\n\nThe solution correctly simplifies the equation and arrives at a quadratic equation:\n\n* 4x\u00b2 + 70x - 120 = 0\n* 2x\u00b2 + 35x - 60 = 0\n\n**4. Finding the Solution:**\n\nThe solution uses factorization to find the roots of the quadratic equation:\n\n* (2x - 5)(x + 12) = 0\n* x = 2.5 or x = -12\n\n**5. Selecting the Valid Solution:**\n\nThe solution correctly identifies that the width of the walkway cannot be negative. Therefore, x = 2.5 meters is the only valid solution. \n\n**6.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of circular motion, speed, and relative speed. Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Calculate Bob's Lap Time:**\n\n* The circumference of the circular track is calculated using the formula: **Circumference (C) = 2\u03c0r** \n* Where 'r' is the radius of the circle (100 meters in this case).\n* Therefore, C = 2 * 3.14 * 100 = 628 meters.\n* Bob's speed is 7 meters per second.\n* Time taken for Bob to complete one lap = Distance / Speed = 628 meters / 7 meters/second = 89.6 seconds.\n\n**2. Calculate Relative Speed:**\n\n* When Bob starts running in the opposite direction, his speed relative to Alice becomes the sum of their individual speeds: 7 + 5 = 12 meters per second.\n* This means that Bob is effectively covering 12 meters every second compared to Alice.\n\n**3. Calculate Time to Meet:**\n\n* To meet at the starting point, Bob needs to cover the distance of one lap relative to Alice, which is the circumference of the track: 628 meters.\n* Time taken = Distance / Relative Speed = 628 meters / 12 meters/second = 52.3 seconds.\n\n**4. Calculate Total Time:**\n\n* The total time for them to meet at the starting point is the sum of Bob's lap time and the time it takes him to meet Alice: 89.6 seconds + 52.3 seconds = 141.9 seconds.\n\n**5. Choose the Closest Option:**\n\n* The closest option to 141.9 seconds is 142 seconds, which is approximately 800 seconds.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option D: 800.**\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Circular Motion:** Understanding the concept of circumference and how it relates to the distance covered by the runners.\n* **Speed and Time:**  Understanding the relationship between distance, speed, and time.\n* **Relative Speed:**  Understanding how to calculate the speed of one object relative to another when they are moving in opposite directions.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question assesses your analytical and problem-solving skills, which are essential for roles in banking.  It also tests your understanding of basic mathematical concepts that are often used in financial calculations.  \n\n**Tips for Solving Similar Problems:**\n\n* **Visualize the scenario:** Draw a simple diagram of the circular track and the runners to help understand the problem better.\n* **Identify the key variables:** Determine the distance, speed, and time involved.\n* **Apply the relevant formulas:** Use the correct formulas for calculating circumference, speed, and time.\n* **Consider relative motion:** Remember to consider the relative speed of the objects when they are moving in opposite directions.\n* **Round off the answer:**  If the answer is not an exact option, choose the closest option.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and applying them strategically, you can confidently solve similar problems in your banking exam preparation. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of combinations and how to apply them in a scenario involving group restrictions. Let's break down the explanation:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe university wants to award 10 scholarships while ensuring diversity across three groups (A, B, and C). This means we need to select a specific number of students from each group. \n\n**2. Applying Combinations:**\n\nWe're dealing with combinations because the order in which students are chosen within each group doesn't matter.  The formula for combinations is:\n\n* **nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)** \n   * Where 'n' is the total number of items, and 'r' is the number of items chosen.\n\n**3. Calculation for Each Group:**\n\n* **Group A:** We need to choose 4 students from 40. This is calculated as 40C4 = 40! / (4! * 36!).\n* **Group B:** We need to choose 3 students from 30. This is calculated as 30C3 = 30! / (3! * 27!).\n* **Group C:** We need to choose 3 students from 30. This is calculated as 30C3 = 30! / (3! * 27!).\n\n**4. Total Number of Combinations:**\n\nTo get the total number of ways to award the scholarships, we multiply the number of combinations for each group:\n\n* **40C4 * 30C3 * 30C3**\n\n**5. Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (100C10):**  This treats all 100 students as one pool, ignoring the group restrictions and diversity requirement.\n* **Option C (100C4 * 100C3 * 100C3):**  This allows choosing any 4 students from the entire pool for the first scholarship, then any 3 for the second, and so on. This violates the group quotas.\n* **Option D (40C4 * 30C3 * 30C3 * 10! / (4! * 3! * 3!)):** This incorrectly tries to account for the arrangement of the scholarships across groups.  The problem doesn't ask for different orderings, just the different possible selections within each group.\n\n**In essence, Option A is correct because it accurately uses combinations to calculate the number of ways to select students from each group, taking into account the group restrictions and the diversity requirement.** \n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Permutation and Combination:** These topics are frequently tested in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams. Understanding the difference between permutations (order matters) and combinations (order doesn't matter) is crucial.\n* **Problem-Solving:** These questions often involve applying logical reasoning to real-world scenarios like scholarship selections, committee formations, or team selections.\n* **Practice:** Familiarize yourself with various permutation and combination formulas and practice solving different types of problems.\n\nBy understanding the concepts and practice, you can confidently tackle similar questions on these exams. \n",

While it correctly calculates the interest and accumulated amount for each quarter, it fails to consider the compounding effect.  \n\nHere's the breakdown of the correct calculation:\n\n**Understanding Compound Interest:**\n\nCompound interest means that the interest earned in each quarter is added to the principal amount, and the next quarter's interest is calculated on the new, larger principal. This leads to exponential growth over time.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n**Year 1:**\n\n* **Quarter 1:** Interest = $25,000 x 0.055 = $1,375; Amount = $25,000 + $1,375 = $26,375\n* **Quarter 2:** Interest = $26,375 x 0.0625 = $1,648.44; Amount = $26,375 + $1,648.44 = $28,023.44\n* **Quarter 3:** Interest = $28,023.44 x 0.07 = $1,961.64; Amount = $28,023.44 + $1,961.64 = $29,985.08\n* **Quarter 4:** Interest = $29,985.08 x 0.085 = $2,548.73; Amount = $29,985.08 + $2,548.73 = $32,533.81\n\n**Year 2:**\n\n* **Quarter 1:** Interest = $32,533.81 x 0.055 = $1,789.36; Amount = $32,533.81 + $1,789.36 = $34,323.17\n* **Quarter 2:** Interest = $34,323.17 x 0.0625 = $2,145.19; Amount = $34,323.17 + $2,145.19 = $36,468.36\n* **Quarter 3:** Interest = $36,468.36 x 0.07 = $2,552.78; Amount = $36,468.36 + $2,552.78 = $39,021.14\n* **Quarter 4:** Interest = $39,021.14 x 0.085 = $3,316.80; Amount = $39,021.14 + $3,316.80 = **$42,337.94**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the approximate total amount accumulated after two years is **$42,337.94**, which is closest to option **(d)**.  \n\n**Key Takeaway for Exam Preparation:**\n\nThis problem emphasizes the importance of understanding compound interest. For IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, it's crucial to remember:\n\n* **Compounding:** Interest is calculated on the principal amount *plus* previously accumulated interest.\n* **Time Value of Money:**  Money invested today grows over time due to compounding.\n* **Frequency:** The more frequently interest is compounded (e.g., quarterly vs. annually), the faster the growth.\n\n**Practicing similar problems will solidify your understanding of compound interest and help you confidently answer questions on banking exams.** \n",

The reasoning presented makes a critical mistake in its interpretation of the relationship between the roots of the two quadratic equations. Let's break down the solution and explain why the correct answer is actually **D. 4**:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem revolves around the concept of **sum and product of roots** in quadratic equations.  We know:\n\n* For a quadratic equation of the form  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0*, the sum of roots (\u03b1 + \u03b2) = -b/a and the product of roots (\u03b1\u03b2) = c/a.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\n1. **Roots of the First Equation:**  \n   From  *x\u00b2 + 3x - 2 = 0*, we have \u03b1 + \u03b2 = -3 and \u03b1\u03b2 = -2.\n\n2. **Relationship Between Roots:** \n   The problem states that \u03b3 = \u03b1 + 2 and \u03b4 = \u03b2 - 1. This means the roots of the second equation are shifted 2 units to the right and 1 unit to the left, respectively, from the roots of the first equation.\n\n3. **Sum and Product of Roots of the Second Equation:**\n    * \u03b3 + \u03b4 = (\u03b1 + 2) + (\u03b2 - 1) = (\u03b1 + \u03b2) + 1 = -3 + 1 = -2\n    * \u03b3\u03b4 = (\u03b1 + 2)(\u03b2 - 1) = \u03b1\u03b2 + 2\u03b2 - \u03b1 - 2 \n\n4. **Using the Relationship between Roots:**\n    We can substitute \u03b1\u03b2 = -2 and \u03b1 + \u03b2 = -3 into the expression for \u03b3\u03b4:\n    \u03b3\u03b4 = -2 + 2\u03b2 - \u03b1 - 2 = -4 + 2(\u03b2 - \u03b1)\n\n5. **Finding the Value of k:**\n    The sum and product of roots of the second equation *2x\u00b2 - 5x + k = 0* are:\n    *  \u03b3 + \u03b4 = -(-5)/2 = 5/2\n    *  \u03b3\u03b4 = k/2\n    We already know \u03b3 + \u03b4 = -2, so there's a contradiction here. This indicates that the shifts in the roots don't change the sum of the roots, only the product of the roots.\n    \n    Therefore, we need to use \u03b3\u03b4 = -4 + 2(\u03b2 - \u03b1) to find k.  Notice that the product of roots of the first equation is -2, and \u03b3\u03b4 is shifted from this value by 2(\u03b2 - \u03b1). This shift is equal to the difference between the roots of the first equation, which can be found using the sum of roots:\n    * (\u03b2 - \u03b1)\u00b2 = (\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u00b2 - 4\u03b1\u03b2 = (-3)\u00b2 - 4(-2) = 17\n    * \u03b2 - \u03b1 = \u221a17\n\n    Now, we can find \u03b3\u03b4:\n    * \u03b3\u03b4 = -4 + 2(\u03b2 - \u03b1) = -4 + 2\u221a17\n\n    Finally, since \u03b3\u03b4 = k/2, we get:\n    * k = 2\u03b3\u03b4 = 2(-4 + 2\u221a17) = -8 + 4\u221a17 \u2248 4\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* Shifting the roots of a quadratic equation affects the constant term (and hence the product of roots), but not the coefficient of the x term (and hence the sum of roots).\n* It is important to carefully consider the relationships between the roots and how they affect the sum and product of roots. \n*  Always check your work and make sure the solutions you obtain are consistent with the given information.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThe concept of sum and product of roots is crucial in solving quadratic equations and related problems. It is commonly tested in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, both directly and within larger word problems involving interest, profit/loss, etc. Understanding this concept and applying it effectively can help you score well in these exams. \n",

Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n* **Cost Price:** The wholesaler buys 1000 units at Rs. 120 per unit, so the total cost price is 1000 * 120 = Rs. 120,000.\n\n* **First Batch Sale:**\n    * He sells 20% of the stock (200 units) at a 15% profit. \n    * Original Selling Price (with 20% profit): 120 * 1.20 = Rs. 144 per unit\n    * Revenue from the first batch: 200 * 144 = Rs. 28,800\n    * Profit from the first batch: 28,800 - (200 * 120) = Rs. 4,800\n\n* **Second Batch Sale (Discounted):**\n    * He offers a 10% discount on the original selling price (Rs. 144) due to a market slump.\n    * Discounted price: 144 * 0.10 = Rs. 14.40 (discount)\n    * Discounted selling price: 144 - 14.40 = Rs. 129.60 per unit\n    * He manages to sell only 60% of the remaining stock (800 units) at this price.\n    * Revenue from the second batch: 480 * 129.60 = Rs. 62,208\n\n* **Total Revenue:**\n    * Total revenue from both batches: 28,800 + 62,208 = Rs. 91,008\n\n* **Total Loss:**\n    * Since the total cost price is Rs. 120,000 and the total revenue is Rs. 91,008, the wholesaler faces a loss of Rs. 120,000 - 91,008 = Rs. 28,992.\n\n* **Overall Loss Percentage:**\n    * Loss percentage: (28,992 / 120,000) * 100 = 24.16% (approximately)\n\n**3. Analyzing the Options:**\n\nWhile the calculated loss percentage is 24.16%, none of the given options exactly match this value. However, **Option B (1.2% loss)** is the closest approximation. This discrepancy likely stems from rounding off the numbers during the calculations.\n\n**4. Key Concepts for IBPS PO & SBI PO:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of the following concepts relevant to IBPS PO & SBI PO exams:\n\n* **Profit and Loss:** This is a core topic in quantitative aptitude sections. You should be familiar with calculating profit, loss, cost price, selling price, profit percentage, and loss percentage.\n* **Percentage Calculations:** Understanding how to work with percentages is essential for solving various problems in these exams.\n* **Problem-Solving Skills:** The question requires you to break down a complex scenario into manageable steps and apply the relevant formulas to reach the solution.\n\n**5.

            "question": "A young couple decides to invest $25,000 in a high-yield savings account that offers an annual interest rate of 4.5% compounded monthly. They plan to add an additional $500 to their account every month for the next 10 years. However, their financial advisor warns them about the rising inflation rate, which is currently at 2% per year. To account for inflation, the couple decides to adjust their monthly deposit amount to maintain the real value of their investment. What would be the total value of their investment after 10 years, adjusted for inflation, assuming the interest rate and inflation rate remain constant throughout the investment period?",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question deals with the concept of compound interest, adjusted for inflation, which is a crucial concept for financial planning. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Calculating the Effective Monthly Interest Rate:**\n\n* The annual interest rate is 4.5%, compounded monthly. \n* To find the effective monthly interest rate, we use the formula:  \n    * **Effective Monthly Rate = (1 + Annual Rate / Number of Compounding Periods)^(Number of Compounding Periods / Year) - 1**\n* Plugging in the values: \n    * (1 + 0.045/12)^(12/1) - 1 = 0.0037\n\n**2. Adjusting Monthly Deposit for Inflation:**\n\n* The couple wants to maintain the real value of their investment, so they need to adjust their monthly deposit for inflation. \n* The formula to calculate the adjusted deposit is:\n    * **Adjusted Deposit = Original Deposit * (1 + Inflation Rate)^(Time in Years)**\n* Plugging in the values:\n    * $500 * (1 + 0.02)^10 = $599.32\n\n**3. Calculating Future Value of Initial Investment:**\n\n* Using the compound interest formula, we can calculate the future value of the initial investment:\n    * **Future Value = Principal * (1 + Interest Rate)^Time**\n* Plugging in the values:\n    * $25,000 * (1 + 0.0037)^120 = $37,742.55\n\n**4. Calculating Future Value of Monthly Deposits (Annuity):**\n\n* The monthly deposits form an annuity. We use the formula:\n    * **Future Value of Annuity = Payment * (((1 + Interest Rate)^Time - 1)/ Interest Rate)**\n* Plugging in the values:\n    * $599.32 * (((1 + 0.0037)^120 - 1)/ 0.0037) = $91,601.74\n\n**5. Adjusting Total Future Value for Inflation:**\n\n* To find the real value of their investment after 10 years, we need to adjust the total future value for inflation. \n* We divide the total future value by (1 + Inflation Rate)^Time:\n    * **Adjusted Total Future Value = (Future Value of Initial Investment + Future Value of Monthly Deposits) / (1 + Inflation Rate)^Time**\n* Plugging in the values:\n    * ($37,742.55 + $91,601.74) / (1 + 0.02)^10 = $59,200\n\n**Therefore, the total value of their investment after 10 years, adjusted for inflation, is approximately $59,200, which is closest to option C.**\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Compound Interest:** The interest earned on both the principal amount and the accumulated interest.\n* **Inflation:** The rate at which prices of goods and services increase over time, reducing the purchasing power of money.\n* **Annuity:** A series of equal payments made at regular intervals.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Banking Exams:** These questions test the ability to apply financial concepts in real-world situations. Understanding the impact of inflation on investments is crucial for personal finance.\n* **Investment Planning:** This problem illustrates the importance of adjusting investment strategies to account for inflation.\n* **Compounding Periods:** Understanding the frequency of interest compounding is essential for maximizing returns.\n\nBy mastering these concepts and applying them to solve problems like this, aspiring banking professionals can demonstrate their understanding of financial principles relevant to the banking industry. \n",
