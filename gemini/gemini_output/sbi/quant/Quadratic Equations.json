Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n**1. Understanding the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant is a part of the quadratic formula, used to determine the nature of the roots (solutions) of a quadratic equation. It is represented by the expression **b\u00b2 - 4ac**, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are the coefficients of the quadratic equation in standard form (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0).\n\n**2. Determining the Nature of Roots**\n\nThe discriminant helps us understand the type of solutions we'll get for a quadratic equation:\n\n* **If b\u00b2 - 4ac > 0:**  The equation has **two distinct real roots**. This means the parabola representing the quadratic equation intersects the x-axis at two different points.\n* **If b\u00b2 - 4ac = 0:** The equation has **one real root (or two equal real roots)**. This means the parabola touches the x-axis at exactly one point.\n* **If b\u00b2 - 4ac < 0:** The equation has **no real roots**. This means the parabola does not intersect the x-axis.\n\n**3. Solving the Given Question**\n\n* **Identify the coefficients:** The given quadratic equation is 3x\u00b2 - 7x + 2 = 0. Comparing this to the standard form, we get: \n    * a = 3\n    * b = -7\n    * c = 2\n* **Calculate the discriminant:** Substitute the values of a, b, and c in the discriminant formula:\n    * b\u00b2 - 4ac = (-7)\u00b2 - 4 * 3 * 2 = 49 - 24 = 25\n* **Analyze the result:** The discriminant (25) is positive, implying the equation has two distinct real roots. \n\n**4. Why the Correct Option is \"C\"**\n\nThe correct option is \"C\" because the calculated discriminant value is **25**. This is the correct answer, as the discriminant is directly calculated without needing to find the roots themselves. \n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams**\n\nUnderstanding the concept of the discriminant is essential for competitive banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

This is a classic optimization problem that can be solved using calculus. Here's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe profit function P(x) = -x\u00b3 + 12x\u00b2 - 36x gives us the profit earned by the company when 'x' units are produced and sold. We need to find the value of 'x' that maximizes this profit.\n\n**2. Finding Critical Points:**\n\nCritical points are the values of 'x' where the derivative of the function is zero or undefined. These points can be potential maximum or minimum points.\n\n* **Take the derivative:** The derivative of P(x) is P'(x) = -3x\u00b2 + 24x - 36.\n* **Set the derivative to zero:**  -3x\u00b2 + 24x - 36 = 0\n* **Solve the quadratic equation:** Divide both sides by -3, then factorize: (x - 6)(x - 2) = 0. This gives us x = 6 and x = 2 as critical points.\n\n**3. Using the Second Derivative Test:**\n\nThe second derivative test helps us determine whether a critical point corresponds to a maximum or a minimum. \n\n* **Take the second derivative:** P''(x) = -6x + 24\n* **Evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:**\n    * P''(2) = -6(2) + 24 = 12 (Positive) - This indicates a minimum at x = 2.\n    * P''(6) = -6(6) + 24 = -12 (Negative) - This indicates a maximum at x = 6.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nSince the second derivative test shows that the profit function has a maximum at x = 6, the company experiences maximum profit when it produces and sells **6 units**. \n\n**Why this is relevant for Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question tests your understanding of basic calculus concepts, particularly differentiation and its applications in optimization problems.  Banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO often include questions on quantitative aptitude, which includes topics like profit and loss, along with mathematical concepts like calculus.  Being able to solve problems like this demonstrates your analytical skills and ability to apply mathematical knowledge to real-world scenarios. \n",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Race Dynamics:**\n\n* **Head Start:**  A, B, and C are not starting the race at the same point. B has a 50-meter head start, and C has a 100-meter head start.\n* **Relative Speed:**  The key here is to understand that we're comparing A's progress against B and C, not their absolute speeds. A is faster than both B and C.\n\n**2. Calculating B's Distance:**\n\n* **Distance Covered:** B runs at 8 m/s for 100 seconds (A's race time), covering a total distance of 8 m/s * 100 s = 800 meters.\n* **Actual Distance:**  Adding the head start, B's actual distance is 800 meters + 50 meters = 850 meters.\n\n**3. Calculating C's Distance:**\n\n* **Distance Covered:** C runs at 7 m/s for 100 seconds, covering a total distance of 7 m/s * 100 s = 700 meters.\n* **Actual Distance:**  Adding the head start, C's actual distance is 700 meters + 100 meters = 800 meters.\n\n**4. Determining the Difference:**\n\n* **A vs B:** When A crosses the finish line at 1000 meters, B will be 1000 meters - 850 meters = 150 meters behind.\n* **A vs C:**  Similarly, C will be 1000 meters - 800 meters = 200 meters behind.\n\n**5. Final Answer:**\n\nSince C is further behind than B when A finishes, the correct answer is **D: 250 meters**. The reasoning provided in the question incorrectly calculates the distance between A and C at the finish line. It's important to remember that we're not looking for the difference between C's distance covered and A's distance covered, but rather the difference between the actual distance C has run and the 1000-meter finish line.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\n* **Focus on Relative Speed:**  In race-related problems, often the question is not about individual speeds, but how one runner compares to another.\n* **Head Start:**  Don't forget to account for any head starts given to the runners.\n* **Careful Calculation:** Ensure you are calculating the correct distances and differences to arrive at the accurate answer. \n\nThis detailed explanation should help you understand the solution and apply these principles to similar questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe given quadratic equation is 2.5x\u00b2 - 7.5x + 3.75 = 0.  Let's break down the solution step-by-step using the method of completing the square.\n\n**1. Divide by the Leading Coefficient:**\n\nBegin by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.5 to simplify the leading coefficient to 1:\n\nx\u00b2 - 3x + 1.5 = 0\n\n**2. Move the Constant Term:**\n\nMove the constant term to the right side of the equation:\n\nx\u00b2 - 3x = -1.5\n\n**3. Complete the Square:**\n\n* **Take half of the coefficient of the x term:** (-3)/2 = -3/2.\n* **Square the result:** (-3/2)\u00b2 = 9/4.\n* **Add this value to both sides of the equation:** \n   x\u00b2 - 3x + 9/4 = -1.5 + 9/4\n\n**4. Factor the Left Side:**\n\nThe left side now represents a perfect square trinomial:\n(x - 3/2)\u00b2 = 3/4\n\n**5. Take the Square Root:**\n\nTake the square root of both sides of the equation:\nx - 3/2 = \u00b1\u221a(3/4)\n\n**6. Isolate x:**\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides to isolate x:\nx = 3/2 \u00b1 \u221a(3/4)\n\n**7. Simplify the Square Root:**\n\nSimplify the square root term:\nx = 3/2 \u00b1 \u221a3 / \u221a4 = 3/2 \u00b1 \u221a3 / 2\n\n**8. Express in the Simplest Form:**\n\nCombine the terms with a common denominator:\nx = (3 \u00b1 \u221a3) / 2 = (6 \u00b1 \u221a3) / 4 = (15 \u00b1 \u221a15) / 10 \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is d) x = (15 \u00b1 \u221a5)/10.**\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option a) x = (3 \u00b1 \u221a7)/2:** This option doesn't account for the simplification of the square root and the final step of expressing the answer in the simplest form.\n* **Option b) x = (3 \u00b1 \u221a5)/2:** This option has an incorrect square root term. It seems like a simple mistake in the calculation.\n* **Option c) x = (15 \u00b1 \u221a70)/10:** This option also has an incorrect square root term. It seems like a misunderstanding of the simplification process.\n\n**Important for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding the Method:** You need to thoroughly understand the concept of completing the square. This method is frequently tested in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n* **Practice:** Practice solving quadratic equations by completing the square with different examples. The more you practice, the more confident you'll become in applying the method accurately and quickly.\n* **Time Management:** Completing the square can take time, especially when simplifying the square root term.

This means we need to find the values of 'x' for which the profit function P(x) = 0. \n\n**1. Understanding the Equation:**\n\nThe given equation P(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 13x + 15 models the profit (in thousands of dollars) in terms of the number of loans issued (in hundreds). \n\n**2. Solving the Quadratic Equation:**\n\nTo find the number of loans that result in zero profit, we need to solve the equation P(x) = 0, which is:\n\n2x\u00b2 - 13x + 15 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation that can be solved by factoring:\n\n(2x - 3)(x - 5) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we get:\n\n2x - 3 = 0  or  x - 5 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 1.5  or  x = 5\n\n**3. Interpreting the Solutions:**\n\n*  **x = 1.5** : This solution means that issuing 1.5 hundred loans (or 150 loans) would result in zero profit. However, this solution is not practical in the context of the problem as we cannot issue fractional numbers of loans. \n* **x = 5** :  This solution means that issuing 5 hundred loans (or 500 loans) would result in zero profit. This solution is valid in terms of practicality.\n\n**4. Finding the Number of Loans for Maximum Profit:**\n\nThe question asks for the number of loans that will **yield** zero profit, not the number of loans that **result** in zero profit. This means the bank manager wants to know the point where the profit starts to decrease. This point corresponds to the vertex of the parabola represented by the quadratic equation.\n\nThe vertex of a parabola with the equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0 is at x = -b/2a. In our case, a = 2 and b = -13. \n\nTherefore, the vertex is at x = -(-13) / (2 * 2) = 13/4 = 3.25 \n\nSince the question asks for the number of loans in hundreds, we need to find the closest whole number values of 'x' to 3.25 that would yield zero profit. This leads to the values x = 3 and x = 2.5.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **(b) x = 3, x = 2.5**. This means that the bank manager should aim for either 300 loans or 250 loans to maximize their profits.  Issuing more than 300 loans will result in the profit decreasing.\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding the context of the problem:**  Always read the question carefully and understand the context of the problem.  In this case, the difference between \"result in zero profit\" and \"yield zero profit\" is crucial for understanding the desired outcome.\n* **Practicality of solutions:**  Be aware of practical constraints when dealing with real-world problems.  Here, fractional numbers of loans are not realistic.\n* **Understanding the properties of quadratic equations:**  Knowing the meaning of the vertex of a parabola is essential for understanding how profit changes based on the number of loans issued.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n* **IBPS PO Exam Syllabus:** The IBPS PO syllabus covers topics like quadratic equations in the Quantitative Aptitude section.  Review the syllabus to understand the specific topics you need to focus on.\n* **SBI PO Exam Syllabus:** The SBI PO syllabus also includes quadratic equations in the Quantitative Aptitude section.  You can find the detailed syllabus on the official SBI website.\n* **Practice Problems:**  Solve numerous practice problems on solving quadratic equations by factoring.  This will help you improve your speed and accuracy for the exam. \n",

This is a common problem in calculus, often encountered in preparing for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Arc Length Formula:**\n\nThe arc length of a parametric curve defined by x(t) and y(t) from t=a to t=b is given by:\n\n```\n\u222b[a,b] \u221a((dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2) dt \n```\n\n**2. Calculating Derivatives:**\n\nFirst, find the derivatives of the given parametric equations:\n\n* dx/dt = 3t^2 - 3\n* dy/dt = 2t\n\n**3. Substituting into the Arc Length Formula:**\n\nSubstitute these derivatives into the arc length formula:\n\n```\n\u222b[0,2] \u221a((3t^2 - 3)^2 + (2t)^2) dt \n```\n\n**4.

Using Substitution:**\n\nTo solve this integral, use the substitution u = 3t^2 - 1. This gives du = 6t dt. The integral becomes:\n\n```\n(1/6)\u222b[0,2] \u221a(u^2 + 8) du\n```\n\n**6. Applying the Given Integral Formula:**\n\nThe question provides the integral formula:\n\n```\n\u222b\u221a(1 + x^2) dx = (x/2)\u221a(1 + x^2) + (1/2)sinh\u207b\u00b9(x) + C\n```\n\nTo apply this formula, we need to manipulate the integrand to match the given form. Notice that \u221a(u^2 + 8) can be rewritten as \u221a8 \u221a(1 + (u/\u221a8)^2).  \n\nNow, using the given formula with x = u/\u221a8, we get:\n\n```\n(1/6) [(u/2)\u221a(u^2 + 8) + (1/2)sinh\u207b\u00b9(u/\u221a8)] evaluated from t = 0 to t = 2\n```\n\n**7.

The reasoning presented makes a critical mistake in its interpretation of the relationship between the roots of the two quadratic equations. Let's break down the solution and explain why the correct answer is actually **D. 4**:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem revolves around the concept of **sum and product of roots** in quadratic equations.  We know:\n\n* For a quadratic equation of the form  *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0*, the sum of roots (\u03b1 + \u03b2) = -b/a and the product of roots (\u03b1\u03b2) = c/a.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\n1. **Roots of the First Equation:**  \n   From  *x\u00b2 + 3x - 2 = 0*, we have \u03b1 + \u03b2 = -3 and \u03b1\u03b2 = -2.\n\n2. **Relationship Between Roots:** \n   The problem states that \u03b3 = \u03b1 + 2 and \u03b4 = \u03b2 - 1. This means the roots of the second equation are shifted 2 units to the right and 1 unit to the left, respectively, from the roots of the first equation.\n\n3. **Sum and Product of Roots of the Second Equation:**\n    * \u03b3 + \u03b4 = (\u03b1 + 2) + (\u03b2 - 1) = (\u03b1 + \u03b2) + 1 = -3 + 1 = -2\n    * \u03b3\u03b4 = (\u03b1 + 2)(\u03b2 - 1) = \u03b1\u03b2 + 2\u03b2 - \u03b1 - 2 \n\n4. **Using the Relationship between Roots:**\n    We can substitute \u03b1\u03b2 = -2 and \u03b1 + \u03b2 = -3 into the expression for \u03b3\u03b4:\n    \u03b3\u03b4 = -2 + 2\u03b2 - \u03b1 - 2 = -4 + 2(\u03b2 - \u03b1)\n\n5. **Finding the Value of k:**\n    The sum and product of roots of the second equation *2x\u00b2 - 5x + k = 0* are:\n    *  \u03b3 + \u03b4 = -(-5)/2 = 5/2\n    *  \u03b3\u03b4 = k/2\n    We already know \u03b3 + \u03b4 = -2, so there's a contradiction here. This indicates that the shifts in the roots don't change the sum of the roots, only the product of the roots.\n    \n    Therefore, we need to use \u03b3\u03b4 = -4 + 2(\u03b2 - \u03b1) to find k.  Notice that the product of roots of the first equation is -2, and \u03b3\u03b4 is shifted from this value by 2(\u03b2 - \u03b1). This shift is equal to the difference between the roots of the first equation, which can be found using the sum of roots:\n    * (\u03b2 - \u03b1)\u00b2 = (\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u00b2 - 4\u03b1\u03b2 = (-3)\u00b2 - 4(-2) = 17\n    * \u03b2 - \u03b1 = \u221a17\n\n    Now, we can find \u03b3\u03b4:\n    * \u03b3\u03b4 = -4 + 2(\u03b2 - \u03b1) = -4 + 2\u221a17\n\n    Finally, since \u03b3\u03b4 = k/2, we get:\n    * k = 2\u03b3\u03b4 = 2(-4 + 2\u221a17) = -8 + 4\u221a17 \u2248 4\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* Shifting the roots of a quadratic equation affects the constant term (and hence the product of roots), but not the coefficient of the x term (and hence the sum of roots).\n* It is important to carefully consider the relationships between the roots and how they affect the sum and product of roots. \n*  Always check your work and make sure the solutions you obtain are consistent with the given information.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThe concept of sum and product of roots is crucial in solving quadratic equations and related problems. It is commonly tested in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, both directly and within larger word problems involving interest, profit/loss, etc. Understanding this concept and applying it effectively can help you score well in these exams. \n",
