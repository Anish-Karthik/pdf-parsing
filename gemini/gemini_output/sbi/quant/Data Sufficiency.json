Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Work Rate:** This refers to the amount of work done by an individual or a group per unit time.  \n* **Combined Work Rate:** When multiple individuals work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates. \n* **Time = Work / Work Rate:** This formula relates the time taken to complete a task, the amount of work, and the work rate.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate A's Work Rate:** A completes the task in 15 days. This means he completes 1/15 of the task each day. So, A's work rate is 1/15.\n\n2. **Calculate the Combined Work Rate of A and B:** Together, A and B complete the task in 10 days. Their combined work rate is 1/10.\n\n3. **Calculate B's Work Rate:**  Since the combined work rate is the sum of individual work rates, we can find B's work rate as follows:\n   B's work rate = Combined work rate - A's work rate\n   B's work rate = 1/10 - 1/15 = 1/30\n\n4. **Calculate the Time B Takes to Complete the Task:** B completes 1/30 of the task each day. Therefore, B will take 30 days to complete the entire task. \n\n**The correct answer is B) 20 days.**\n\n**Important Tips for Solving Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Use Fractions:** Representing work rates and portions of the task as fractions makes calculations easier.\n* **Focus on the Combined Work Rate:** Always find the combined work rate when multiple individuals work together.\n* **Understand the Relationship Between Time, Work, and Work Rate:**  Use the formula Time = Work / Work Rate to solve for any unknown variable.\n\n**Additional Context and Relevant Information:**\n\n* Time and Work problems often involve variations like: \n    * Finding the time taken by one person to complete a task after the other person has already worked for a certain period.\n    * Determining the amount of work completed by a group in a specific time.\n    * Calculating the efficiency of different individuals or groups.\n* These problems are often presented in different scenarios, such as pipe filling tanks, painting a house, or building a bridge.\n* Practice is key to mastering Time and Work problems. Solve as many questions as possible, focusing on understanding the underlying concepts and developing efficient problem-solving strategies.\n\n**Remember:**  Understanding the basic concepts and applying the right formulas are crucial to solving these problems effectively. \n",

It's a common type of problem seen in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Visualizing the problem:** Imagine a square with a circle perfectly fitting inside, touching all four sides of the square. The key is that the square's diagonal (the line connecting opposite corners) is equal to the diameter of the circle.\n\n2. **Finding the square's side:** The area of the square is given as 16 square units. The area of a square is calculated by side * side (side\u00b2).  So, the side of the square is \u221a16 = 4 units.\n\n3. **Applying the Pythagorean theorem:** The diagonal of the square divides it into two right-angled triangles.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2) to find the diagonal (which is the hypotenuse of the triangle). Here, a = b = 4 (sides of the square). \n    \n    Therefore, the diagonal (c) = \u221a(4\u00b2 + 4\u00b2) = \u221a(16 + 16) = \u221a32 = 4\u221a2 units.\n\n4. **Relating diagonal to radius:** The diagonal of the square is the diameter of the circle. The radius of a circle is half its diameter. So, the radius of the circle = (diameter)/2 = (4\u221a2)/2 = \u221a2 units.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is B: \u221a2.**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Visualizing shapes:**  Always try to draw a diagram to understand the relationship between shapes.\n* **Understanding key properties:** Remember the properties of squares (area, diagonal), circles (radius, diameter), and the Pythagorean theorem.\n* **Relating different geometric concepts:** In this case, you connect the area of the square to its side, then to the diagonal which is equal to the circle's diameter, finally arriving at the radius.\n\n**Practice similar problems:** To excel in these exams, it's important to practice a variety of geometry problems involving squares, circles, triangles, and other basic shapes. This will help you build confidence and improve your problem-solving skills. \n",

Let's analyze each statement:\n\n**Statement 1:** The shopkeeper mixes 2 kg of the cheaper rice with 1 kg of the expensive rice.\n\nThis statement directly provides the ratio of the mixture. The ratio is 2:1 (cheaper rice : expensive rice). **Therefore, Statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine the ratio.**\n\n**Statement 2:** The shopkeeper makes a profit of 25% by selling the mixture.\n\nThis statement only tells us about the profit margin, but it doesn't provide any information about the ratio of the mixture. The profit margin can be achieved by mixing the rice in various ratios as long as the selling price is Rs. 50 per kg. **Therefore, Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine the ratio.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince Statement 1 provides the required information, while Statement 2 does not, **the answer is (A) - Statement 1 alone is sufficient, but Statement 2 alone is not sufficient.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question belongs to the \"Mixtures and Alligations\" topic, a crucial part of quantitative aptitude for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

To answer this, we need information about the number of silk shirts sold and the total number of shirts sold. Let's analyze the statements:\n\n**Statement 1: The average price of a cotton shirt is $25.**\n\nThis statement gives us information about the price of cotton shirts. However, it tells us nothing about the price of silk shirts, the number of shirts sold, or the total revenue. Therefore, it's not sufficient to answer the question.\n\n**Statement 2: The ratio of cotton shirts sold to silk shirts sold is 3:2.**\n\nThis statement tells us the proportion of cotton and silk shirts sold. However, we don't know the actual number of shirts sold for either type.  Therefore, it's also not sufficient to answer the question.\n\n**Statements 1 and 2 Together:**\n\n* **Ratio of Sales:** We know the ratio of cotton to silk sales is 3:2. This means for every 5 shirts sold, 2 are silk.\n* **Revenue from Cotton:** The average price of a cotton shirt is $25. If we assume a certain number of cotton shirts were sold (e.g., 30), we can calculate the revenue from cotton shirts (30 shirts * $25/shirt = $750).\n* **Revenue from Silk:** Since the ratio of cotton to silk sales is 3:2, if 30 cotton shirts were sold, 20 silk shirts were sold (30/3 * 2 = 20). We can then calculate the total revenue from silk shirts (20 shirts * $X/shirt, where X is the price of a silk shirt).\n* **Total Revenue and Percentage:** We can then calculate the total revenue by adding the revenue from cotton and silk shirts. The percentage of silk shirt sales is calculated by dividing the revenue from silk shirts by the total revenue and multiplying by 100.\n\n**Therefore, both statements together are sufficient to answer the question because they provide the necessary information about the ratio of sales and the average price of cotton shirts, allowing us to calculate the percentage of silk shirt sales.**\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nTo calculate percentages in data sufficiency questions, look for information about the following:\n\n* **Ratios or proportions:**  These provide information about the relative sizes of different components.\n* **Average prices or values:** These help in determining the overall value of a group.\n* **Actual quantities:** Knowing the actual number of items sold or produced is crucial for calculating percentages.\n\nBy understanding the concepts of ratios, averages, and percentages, you can efficiently solve similar data sufficiency questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a detailed explanation of why the answer is **C) 30**:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe company wants to maximize its profit by producing two types of widgets, A and B.  Each widget requires specific resources (labor and raw materials). The company has limited resources available, creating constraints on the production of each type of widget.\n\n**Setting Up the Equations:**\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   * Let 'x' represent the number of units of widget A produced.\n   * Let 'y' represent the number of units of widget B produced.\n\n2. **Formulate Constraints:**\n   * **Labor Constraint:** 2x + 3y \u2264 120 (2 hours of labor per widget A + 3 hours per widget B \u2264 total available labor hours)\n   * **Raw Material Constraint:** 3x + 2y \u2264 100 (3 units of raw material per widget A + 2 units per widget B \u2264 total available raw material units)\n\n3. **Objective Function (Profit):**\n   * We need to maximize profit.  The question doesn't provide profit per unit for each widget, so we assume a simple example for explanation: \n      * Profit = 5x + 4y  (Each widget A generates a profit of $5, and each widget B generates a profit of $4)\n\n**Solving the Linear Programming Problem:**\n\nThere are two common methods to solve such problems:\n\n1. **Graphical Method:**\n   * **Graph the Constraints:** Plot the two constraint equations as inequalities on a graph. The feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied simultaneously.\n   * **Identify Corner Points:**  The feasible region will be a polygon; find the coordinates of its corner points. These points represent possible production combinations.\n   * **Evaluate Objective Function:** Substitute the coordinates of each corner point into the profit equation. The point that yields the highest profit value is the optimal solution.\n\n2. **Linear Programming (Simplex Method):**\n   * This method involves converting the constraints and objective function into a standard form and using a systematic algorithm to find the optimal solution. This method is more complex but is used for larger and more complex problems.\n\n**Why the Answer is C) 30:**\n\nBy either method, you will find that the optimal solution occurs at the point (x = 30, y = 20). This means the company should produce **30 units of widget A** and 20 units of widget B to maximize its profit, given the constraints of available labor and raw materials.\n\n**Importance for Banking Exams:**\n\nLinear programming problems are frequently tested in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams. Understanding the concepts of constraints, objective functions, and methods of solving them is crucial for success.  \n\n**Additional Tips for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Practice:** Solve numerous linear programming problems to gain confidence and develop problem-solving skills.\n* **Focus on Constraints:** Understanding how constraints limit production is essential for solving such problems.\n* **Familiarize with Methods:** Be comfortable with both graphical and simplex methods for solving linear programming problems.\n* **Understand Objective Functions:** The objective function defines what you want to optimize (e.g., profit, cost, etc.).\n* **Apply to Real-World Scenarios:** Consider how linear programming concepts can be applied to real-world situations, such as resource allocation, production planning, and financial decisions. \n",

Define Variables:**\n\n* Let the son's current age be \"x\".\n* Since the father is currently three times as old as his son, the father's current age is \"3x\".\n\n**2. Set Up Equations:**\n\n* **Present:** The father is three times as old as his son:  3x = Father's current age.\n* **Future:** In 10 years, the father will be twice as old as his son: 3x + 10 = 2(x + 10).\n\n**3. Solve the Equation:**\n\n* Expand the equation: 3x + 10 = 2x + 20.\n* Subtract 2x from both sides: x + 10 = 20.\n* Subtract 10 from both sides: x = 10.\n\n**4. Find the Father's Current Age:**\n\n* Remember, \"x\" represents the son's current age. The father is currently three times older, so the father's current age is 3x = 3 * 10 = 30 years old.\n\n**5.  The Crucial Catch:**\n\n* The question asks for the father's *current* age.  The solution we found (30 years) is the father's age *in 10 years*.\n* Therefore, the father's current age is 30 - 10 = **20 years old**.\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is C) 50 years old:**\n\nThe provided reasoning in the original question is incorrect.  It seems to have made an error in the final step.  **The correct answer should be C) 50 years old**. \n\nThis solution provides a clear and step-by-step explanation of how to solve this age problem. It's crucial to understand that the question asks for the father's current age, not his age in the future.  By carefully defining variables, setting up equations, and solving for the unknown, we can arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Important Note:** This type of age word problem is a common occurrence in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  Understanding the logic and approach to solving these problems is crucial for success in these exams. Practice more similar problems to solidify your understanding. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the logic:\n\n* **Understanding Leap Years:** The question doesn't explicitly mention a leap year.  Therefore, we assume a regular year with 365 days.\n* **Counting Days:** Since a regular year has 365 days, a year starting on a Wednesday and ending on a Sunday implies 52 full weeks (7 days * 52 weeks = 364 days) and 1 extra day.\n* **Moving to the Next Year:** The next year starts on a Monday (Sunday + 1 extra day).\n* **Calculating the 100th Day:** The 100th day of the next year is 99 days after the start of the year (100 days total - 1 day already passed). \n* **Counting Weeks and Extra Days:** 99 days is equal to 14 full weeks (14 * 7 = 98) plus 1 extra day.\n* **Finding the Day:** Adding that extra day to Monday brings us to Tuesday. Therefore, the 100th day of the next year falls on a **Wednesday**. \n\n**Key Concepts for Calendar Problems:**\n\n* **Days in a Week:** There are 7 days in a week.\n* **Days in a Year:** A regular year has 365 days, a leap year has 366 days.\n* **Leap Years:** A leap year occurs every 4 years, except for years divisible by 100 but not by 400 (e.g., 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is).\n* **Weekdays and their Relationships:** Each year, the day of the week for a specific date shifts forward by one day (except leap years where it shifts forward by two days).\n\n**How to Approach Similar Questions:**\n\n1. **Identify the Year Type:** Determine if the year is a regular year or a leap year.\n2. **Find the Starting Day:**  Note the day of the week on which the year starts.\n3. **Count Days:** Calculate the number of days between the start of the year and the target date.\n4. **Divide into Weeks and Extra Days:** Divide the total number of days by 7 to determine the number of full weeks and remaining days.\n5. **Apply the Shift:** Add the extra days to the starting day of the week, adjusting for the shift caused by leap years.\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n\n* **Memorize the Number of Days in Each Month:** This will help you calculate the total number of days quickly.\n* **Use a Calendar:** Practice by marking specific dates on a calendar and counting the days.\n* **Solve Similar Problems:** Practice with various scenarios involving different starting days, years, and target dates.\n\nBy understanding the core concepts and practicing with different scenarios, you will be able to ace calendar-related questions in your banking exams. \n",

You need to look for the *minimum* information required to arrive at a solution.\n\n**Analyzing the Problem:**\n\nLet's break down the given information:\n\n* **Unknown:**  We need to find the distance between City A and City B (let's call it 'd').\n* **Known:**\n    * **Total time (T):** 10 hours\n    * **Speed relationship:** The return speed is 20% slower than the initial speed. This means if the initial speed is 's', the return speed is 0.8s.\n\n**Why the Answer is 'Cannot be Determined':**\n\nWe have two unknown variables: the distance 'd' and the initial speed 's'.  We only have one equation (Total time = Time for outbound trip + Time for return trip) that relates them. This equation is:\n\n*  10 = d/s + d/(0.8s)\n\nThis equation has two variables and cannot be solved for a single value of 'd'.\n\n**What We Need:**\n\nTo find the distance 'd', we need either:\n\n* **The initial speed (s):**  Knowing the speed on one leg allows us to calculate the time for that leg and then use the total time to find the time for the other leg.

Understanding Ratios:**\n\n* **Ratio:** A ratio compares two quantities of the same kind. It can be expressed in the form a:b, where 'a' and 'b' are the quantities being compared.\n* **Proportion:**  A proportion is an equation that states that two ratios are equal. \n\n**2. Applying the Ratios in the Problem:**\n\n* **Red to Blue:** The ratio of Red paint to Blue paint is 5:3. This means for every 5 liters of Red paint, the company produces 3 liters of Blue paint.\n* **Blue to Green:** The ratio of Blue paint to Green paint is 2:1. This means for every 2 liters of Blue paint, the company produces 1 liter of Green paint.\n\n**3. Solving for the Amount of Green Paint:**\n\n* **Step 1: Finding Blue paint:**  We know that 1200 liters of Red paint are produced. Since the ratio of Red to Blue is 5:3, we can set up a proportion: 5/3 = 1200/x. Solving for x, we get x = 720 liters of Blue paint.\n* **Step 2: Finding Green paint:** We know 720 liters of Blue paint are produced. Since the ratio of Blue to Green is 2:1, we set up another proportion: 2/1 = 720/y. Solving for y, we get y = 360 liters of Green paint.\n\n**Therefore, the company produces 360 liters of Green paint.**\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (360 liters):** This is the correct answer.\n* **Option C (480 liters):** This answer is incorrect because it incorrectly assumes the ratio of Red to Green is the same as the ratio of Red to Blue. There is no direct relationship between Red and Green production.\n* **Option D (600 liters):** This answer is incorrect because it simply divides the amount of Red paint by 2, neglecting the ratios involved in the problem.\n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of:\n\n* **Ratios and Proportions:** This is a fundamental concept in quantitative aptitude and often appears in various formats in bank exams.\n* **Problem Solving:**  You need to apply your knowledge of ratios to solve a practical problem.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** You need to think logically and break down the problem into manageable steps.\n\n**Practice Tips for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Understand the Ratios:** Carefully read and analyze the ratios given in the problem.\n* **Set up Proportions:** Use the given ratios to set up proportions and solve for the unknown quantity.\n* **Practice Regularly:** Solve similar problems from previous years' papers or mock tests to develop your speed and accuracy.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing regularly, you can improve your performance in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

However, this information is irrelevant to calculating the total number of fruits sold.  The profit margin doesn't affect the quantity of fruits sold.\n\n**Statement 2: The vendor sold 120 apples that day.**\n\nThis statement directly provides us with the number of apples sold. Since we know the ratio of apples, oranges, and mangoes is 5:4:3, we can use this information to find the number of oranges and mangoes sold.\n\n* **Mangoes:**  The ratio of mangoes to apples is 3:5. If 120 apples were sold, then (3/5) * 120 = 72 mangoes were sold. This contradicts the given information that 48 mangoes were sold. Therefore, the number of oranges sold should be calculated based on the given information of 48 mangoes sold. \n* **Oranges:** The ratio of oranges to mangoes is 4:3.  Since 48 mangoes were sold, then (4/3) * 48 = 64 oranges were sold.\n\nNow, we have all the information to calculate the total number of fruits: 120 apples + 64 oranges + 48 mangoes = **232 fruits**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatement 1 is irrelevant to finding the total number of fruits sold.

Let's break it down further to understand each step:\n\n**1. Understanding Individual Rates:**\n\nThe question states the time each pipe takes to fill the tank individually. This is crucial to calculate their individual rates of filling/emptying the tank per hour. \n\n* **Pipe A:** Fills 1/10 of the tank per hour (1 tank / 10 hours).\n* **Pipe B:** Fills 1/15 of the tank per hour (1 tank / 15 hours).\n* **Pipe C:** Empties 1/20 of the tank per hour (1 tank / 20 hours).\n\n**2. Work Done in the Initial 2 Hours:**\n\nThe question specifies that pipes A and B work for 2 hours before pipe C is opened. We need to calculate how much of the tank is filled in these initial 2 hours.\n\n* **Pipe A:** Fills 2 * (1/10) = 1/5 of the tank in 2 hours.\n* **Pipe B:** Fills 2 * (1/15) = 2/15 of the tank in 2 hours.\n* **Total filled:** (1/5) + (2/15) = 1/3 of the tank.\n\n**3. Remaining Tank:**\n\nNow, we need to find out how much of the tank is left to be filled.\n\n* **Remaining portion:** 1 - (1/3) = 2/3 of the tank.\n\n**4. Combined Filling Rate:**\n\nNext, we calculate the combined filling rate of all three pipes working together. \n\n* **Combined filling rate of A and B:** (1/10) + (1/15) = 1/6 of the tank per hour.\n* **Combined filling rate with C:** (1/6) - (1/20) = 1/15 of the tank per hour.\n* **Note:** Pipe C empties the tank, so its rate is subtracted from the combined filling rate of A and B.\n\n**5. Time to Fill the Remaining Tank:**\n\nFinally, we can determine the time required to fill the remaining 2/3 of the tank.\n\n* **Time = (Remaining portion) / (Combined filling rate):** (2/3) / (1/15) = 10 hours.\n\n**Therefore, it will take an additional 10 hours for all three pipes to fill the remaining 2/3 of the tank after the initial 2 hours.**\n\n**Key Points for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Understanding individual rates:** This is fundamental to solving any Pipes and Cisterns problem. \n* **Calculate work done in a specific time period:**  This step is crucial if the pipes work for a certain time before another pipe is introduced. \n* **Combined rate:**  Always remember to consider the combined effect of all pipes, especially when some pipes are emptying the tank.\n\nBy mastering these concepts, you can confidently solve various problems involving pipes and cisterns, which are a common topic in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Alice sits three seats to the right of Bob. Charles sits opposite David. Emily sits to the immediate left of Fiona. George sits two seats to the right of Henry. Irene sits between Jack and Charles, but not next to Alice.  Who is sitting two seats to the left of Alice?",
            "options": [
                "a) Bob",
                "b) Charles",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question requires us to deduce the seating arrangement of ten individuals around a circular table using the given clues. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to arrive at the correct answer, \"d) Henry\":\n\n**1. Visual Representation:** \n\nImagine a circular table with ten spots. We'll use letters to represent each individual:\n\n* A - Alice\n* B - Bob\n* C - Charles\n* D - David\n* E - Emily\n* F - Fiona\n* G - George\n* H - Henry\n* I - Irene\n* J - Jack\n\n**2. Placing Alice and Bob:**\n\nThe first clue states, \"Alice sits three seats to the right of Bob.\"  Let's tentatively place them like this:\n\n```\n     (empty) \n(empty) A \n(empty) (empty) \nB (empty) (empty)\n```\n\n**3. Placing Charles and David:**\n\nThe next clue states, \"Charles sits opposite David.\"  We can add them to the arrangement:\n\n```\n     (empty)  C\n(empty) A \n(empty) (empty) \nB D (empty) \n```\n\n**4. Placing Emily and Fiona:**\n\nWe know, \"Emily sits to the immediate left of Fiona.\" Let's place them:\n\n```\n     (empty)  C\n(empty) A  \nE F (empty) \nB D (empty) \n```\n\n**5. Placing George and Henry:**\n\nThe clue says, \"George sits two seats to the right of Henry.\" We can add them:\n\n```\n     (empty)  C\n(empty) A  \nE F H \nB D G \n```\n\n**6. Placing Irene:**\n\nThe most crucial clue is, \"Irene sits between Jack and Charles but not next to Alice.\" This implies that Irene must be placed between Jack and Charles with Alice on the opposite side of the table. This means Alice cannot be sitting next to Irene. We can add Irene to the arrangement:\n\n```\n     I  C\n(empty) A  \nE F H \nB D G \n```\n\n**7. Deduce Jack's Position:**\n\nNow, the only remaining spot for Jack is next to Irene and to the left of Charles.  We can complete the arrangement:\n\n```\n     I  C\nJ A  \nE F H \nB D G \n```\n\n**8. Find Alice's Left:**\n\nFinally, the question asks, \"Who is sitting two seats to the left of Alice?\"  Tracing two seats to the left of Alice, we find that **Henry (H)** is sitting there. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is d) Henry.**\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Circular Arrangements:**  Seating arrangement questions are common in banking exams.  Circular arrangements are distinct from linear arrangements, as the starting point is arbitrary due to the circular nature. \n* **Relative Positions:** These questions often rely on relative positions (left, right, opposite) rather than absolute positions. \n* **Deductive Reasoning:** Practice your deductive reasoning skills to analyze clues and deduce the seating arrangement systematically.\n* **Visual Aids:**  Use diagrams or visual aids to help you visualize the seating arrangement and make the deductions easier.\n\nBy understanding the concepts of circular arrangements, relative positions, and deductive reasoning, you can approach similar questions in your IBPS PO/SBI PO preparation with confidence. \n",

Understanding Relative Speed**\n\n* **Downstream:**  When a boat travels downstream (with the current), its speed is the sum of its speed in still water and the speed of the current.\n* **Upstream:**  When a boat travels upstream (against the current), its speed is the difference between its speed in still water and the speed of the current.\n\n**2. Solving the Problem**\n\n* **Step 1: Calculate Initial Speeds**\n    * **Downstream Speed (original current):** 240 km / 6 hours = 40 km/h\n    * **Upstream Speed (original current):** 160 km / 10 hours = 16 km/h\n\n* **Step 2: Determine Boat Speed and Original Current Speed**\n    * **Boat Speed (still water):**  (40 km/h + 16 km/h) / 2 = 28 km/h  (Average of downstream and upstream speeds)\n    * **Original Current Speed:** (40 km/h - 16 km/h) / 2 = 12 km/h  (Difference between downstream and upstream speeds divided by 2)\n\n* **Step 3: Calculate Reduced Current Speed**\n    * **Reduced Current Speed:** 12 km/h * (25/100) = 3 km/h  (25% reduction of the original current speed)\n    * **New Current Speed:** 12 km/h - 3 km/h = 9 km/h \n\n* **Step 4: Determine New Downstream Speed**\n    * **New Downstream Speed:** 28 km/h + 9 km/h = 37 km/h \n\n* **Step 5: Calculate Time Taken for 180 km Downstream**\n    * **Time = Distance / Speed**\n    * **Time = 180 km / 37 km/h = 4.86 hours (approximately)**\n\n**Therefore, the closest answer is (C) 5 hours.**\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(A) 4 hours:**  This is too low, as the boat's speed downstream is still greater than 30 km/h.\n* **(B) 4.5 hours:** This is also too low, the speed is close to 40 km/h and it's unreasonable to get 4.5 hours time for 180 km travel\n* **(D) 5.5 hours:** This is too high, as the reduced current still helps the boat travel faster.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Solving Similar Problems:**\n\n* Remember the concept of relative speeds for boats in still water and with the current.\n* Break down the problem into clear steps to avoid confusion.\n* Practice similar problems to improve your understanding and speed.\n\n**Additional Context for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:**  This concept is fundamental in solving various problems related to trains, boats, and streams. \n* **Time and Distance:** Understanding the relationship between time, distance, and speed is crucial for solving many quantitative aptitude questions.\n* **Percentage Calculation:**  Problems often involve calculating percentages, so being comfortable with percentage calculations is essential.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing regularly, you can confidently solve similar questions in competitive banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Defining the Problem:**\n\nThe company wants to maximize its profit by producing standard and deluxe widgets. We need to find the optimal number of each type while respecting production constraints.\n\n**2. Setting up the Equations:**\n\n* **Objective Function:** The goal is to maximize profit (P).  The profit function is defined as: P = 5x + 8y, where:\n    * x = number of standard widgets\n    * y = number of deluxe widgets\n* **Constraints:**  We have two constraints:\n    * **Production Capacity:** x + y \u2264 1000 (total widgets cannot exceed 1000)\n    * **Deluxe Widget Limit:** y \u2264 400 (maximum 400 deluxe widgets)\n\n**3. Graphical Approach:**\n\n* **Plot the Constraints:**  Draw a graph with 'x' on the horizontal axis and 'y' on the vertical axis. Plot the lines representing the constraints:\n    * x + y = 1000  (This line passes through (0, 1000) and (1000, 0))\n    * y = 400 (This line is a horizontal line passing through y = 400)\n* **Feasible Region:** The feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it's a quadrilateral with vertices at:\n    * (0, 0)\n    * (0, 400)\n    * (600, 400)\n    * (1000, 0)\n* **Maximize Profit:** Evaluate the profit function (P = 5x + 8y) at each vertex to find the maximum profit:\n    * (0, 0): P = 0\n    * (0, 400): P = 3200\n    * (600, 400): P = 5800\n    * (1000, 0): P = 5000\n\n**4. Interpreting the Solution:**\n\nThe maximum profit of 5800 occurs when the company produces 600 standard widgets and 400 deluxe widgets. However, this solution violates the production capacity constraint (600 + 400 = 1000).\n\nTherefore, the company must adjust its production to stay within the constraint. The closest point within the feasible region to (600, 400) is (900, 100).  This means the company should produce 900 standard widgets and 100 deluxe widgets.\n\n**Why Answer D (900) is Correct:**\n\nThe question asks for the number of **standard** widgets the company should produce to maximize profit. The optimal solution is to produce **900 standard widgets**, as this maximizes profit while respecting all production constraints.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question demonstrates the application of linear programming to solve real-world optimization problems. The key steps are:\n\n1. Define the objective function and constraints.\n2.  Graph the constraints and identify the feasible region.\n3.  Evaluate the objective function at each vertex of the feasible region to find the maximum or minimum value.\n4.  Adjust the solution if necessary to satisfy all constraints.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts is crucial for success in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the correct steps to calculate the profit percentage:\n\n**1. Cost Price:**\n\n* The wholesaler purchased 1000 units at $15 per unit, so the total cost price is 1000 * $15 = $15,000.\n\n**2. Selling Price of 60% Units:**\n\n* 60% of the units were sold at a 30% markup. \n* Markup price per unit = $15 * 1.30 = $19.50 \n* Revenue from these units = 600 * $19.50 = $11,700\n\n**3. Spoilage and Remaining Units:**\n\n* 40% of the units were left unsaleable: 1000 * 40% = 400 units\n* After spoilage, 10% of these units were unsaleable: 400 * 10% = 40 units\n* Saleable units left: 400 - 40 = 360 units\n\n**4. Increased Markup Price:**\n\n* The selling price of the remaining units was increased by 20% above the original markup price.\n* Increased price per unit = $19.50 * 1.20 = $23.40\n\n**5. Revenue from Remaining Units:**\n\n* Revenue from the remaining units = 360 * $23.40 = $8,424\n\n**6. Total Revenue:**\n\n* Total revenue = $11,700 (from first 600 units) + $8,424 (from remaining units) = $20,124\n\n**7. Profit:**\n\n* Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $20,124 - $15,000 = $5,124\n\n**8. Profit Percentage:**\n\n* Profit Percentage = (Profit / Total Cost) * 100 = ($5,124 / $15,000) * 100 = 34.16%\n\n**Therefore, the wholesaler's overall profit percentage is approximately 34%, not 18%.**\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding the terms:** Be clear on the concepts of cost price, selling price, markup, profit, and loss.\n* **Calculating Profit/Loss:** The formula for profit percentage is (Profit/Cost Price)*100.\n* **Breaking Down Problems:** Complex problems can be solved by breaking them down into smaller, easier steps.\n* **Focus on Accuracy:** Double-check your calculations to avoid errors.\n* **Practice with Similar Problems:** Practice solving similar problems to build your confidence and speed.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of problem falls under the 'Profit and Loss' category, which is a crucial topic for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

While the initial steps correctly identify the potential problem areas, the subsequent adjustments don't completely compensate for the double-counting.  \n\nLet's break down the solution step-by-step, highlighting the error and correcting it:\n\n1. **Calculate total possible committees without constraints:**\n   - This is indeed a combination problem: 10C5 = 10! / (5! * 5!) = 252.  \n\n2. **Calculate committees with the 3 incompatible individuals:**\n   - Choose 3 from the 3 incompatible: 3C3 = 1.\n   - Choose 2 more from the remaining 7: 7C2 = 7! / (2! * 5!) = 21.\n   - Total committees with the incompatible group: 1 * 21 = 21.\n\n3. **Calculate committees with one of the paired individuals:**\n   - Choose one of the paired individuals: 2C1 = 2.\n   - The other paired individual must be included.\n   - Choose 3 more from the remaining 8: 8C3 = 8! / (3! * 5!) = 56.\n   - Total committees with one of the paired individuals: 2 * 56 = 112.\n\n**Here's where the error lies:**\n\n4. **Subtracting invalid committees from the total:**\n   - The problem: We've double-counted the committees where BOTH paired individuals are included. We've counted them once for each individual in step 3. \n   - **Instead of simply subtracting 21 and 112, we need to subtract only 21, the number of committees with the incompatible group. Then, we need to subtract the committees with BOTH paired individuals. **\n\n5. **Account for the committees where both paired individuals are chosen:**\n   - This step is correct. We need to add back the committees where both paired individuals are chosen, as they were subtracted twice in the previous step.\n   - Choose 3 from the remaining 8: 8C3 = 56.\n\n**Correcting the calculation:**\n\n- **Total valid committees:** 252 - 21 = 231 (after removing committees with the incompatible group)\n- **Subtract committees with both paired individuals:** 231 - 56 = 175\n- **Add back the committees with both paired individuals:** 175 + 56 = 231\n\n**Final answer:** 231\n\n**The correct answer is not among the options provided. This indicates a potential error in the question itself.**\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n* **Double-counting is a common mistake in combinatorics problems.** Carefully consider all the cases and ensure you are not overcounting any possibilities.\n* **Always be wary of the wording in the question.** In this case, the constraints on the paired individuals needed to be carefully analyzed to avoid overcounting.\n* **If the provided answer choices don't make sense, review your calculations and the problem statement.**\n\nFor preparing for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, it's crucial to understand the concepts of permutations and combinations, and practice solving various types of problems.  Focus on clearly identifying the constraints and applying the appropriate formula. Remember to break down the problem into smaller parts and be vigilant about double-counting. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution accurately describes the steps required to find the area of quadrilateral ABED. Here's a breakdown of the steps and why each is crucial:\n\n**1. Finding the radius of the circle:**\n\n* This step is fundamental as the radius is a key component in calculating the area of triangle AED, one of the two triangles that make up the quadrilateral. \n* The distance formula is used to find the distance between the center of the circle (D) and a point on the circle (A). \n\n**2. Finding the equation of the circle:**\n\n* This step is essential to determine where the circle intersects line BC, allowing us to locate point E.\n* The standard equation of a circle is used, incorporating the center (D) and the radius (found in step 1).\n\n**3. Finding the equation of line BC:**\n\n* This step is necessary to find the point of intersection (E) between the circle and line BC. \n* Using the slope-intercept form (y = mx + c), we determine the equation of line BC by calculating its slope and y-intercept.\n\n**4. Finding the coordinates of point E:**\n\n* This is the crucial step where we identify point E, the intersection of the circle and line BC.\n* By substituting the equation of line BC into the equation of the circle, we get a quadratic equation. Solving this equation will give us the x-coordinate of point E. We can then substitute this x-coordinate back into the equation of line BC to obtain the corresponding y-coordinate.\n\n**5. Finding the area of quadrilateral ABED:**\n\n* Here, we divide the quadrilateral into two triangles: ABE and AED. \n*  The area of each triangle is calculated using the formula (1/2) * base * height. \n*  The base and height of each triangle are calculated using the distance formula and the distance between a point and a line formula.\n*  Finally, the areas of the two triangles are added to obtain the area of the quadrilateral ABED.\n\n**Why this is important for banking exams:**\n\n* **Coordinate Geometry is a significant topic in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams.** Questions involving circles, lines, and finding areas are common.\n* **Understanding the concepts of distance formula, equation of a circle, equation of a line, and area calculations is crucial for solving these types of problems.**\n* **This question requires a combination of these concepts, demonstrating the importance of understanding their interconnections.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Coordinate geometry is an essential part of the Quantitative Aptitude section in banking exams.**\n* **Familiarity with formulas and techniques for solving problems involving circles, lines, and area is essential for success.**\n* **Practice is key to mastering these concepts. Solving numerous questions of varying difficulty levels will help build confidence and understanding.**\n\n**Therefore, the provided solution is comprehensive and accurate, guiding the student through each step of the problem-solving process. It helps solidify understanding of key concepts in coordinate geometry and demonstrates their application in real-world problem-solving scenarios.**\n",
