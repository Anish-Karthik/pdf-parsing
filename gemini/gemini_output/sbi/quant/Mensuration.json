The correct formula for the area of a rhombus is (1/2) * (product of diagonals). \n* **Misunderstanding of the Pythagorean Theorem:** While the Pythagorean theorem can be used to find the length of the other diagonal, the solution uses the side length of the rhombus (10 cm) as the hypotenuse, which is incorrect. The hypotenuse should be the side of the triangle formed by half of each diagonal.\n\n**Correct Solution:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Properties:**  As mentioned correctly, a rhombus has diagonals that bisect each other at right angles, creating four congruent right-angled triangles.\n\n2. **Finding the Other Diagonal:**  Let's focus on one of these right-angled triangles.\n    * The hypotenuse is the side of the rhombus (10 cm).\n    * One leg is half the given diagonal (16 cm / 2 = 8 cm).\n    * Let the other leg (half the other diagonal) be 'x'.\n\n    Now, applying the Pythagorean theorem: 10\u00b2 = 8\u00b2 + x\u00b2\n    Solving for 'x': x\u00b2 = 100 - 64 = 36 => x = 6 cm.\n    Therefore, the full length of the other diagonal is 2 * 6 cm = 12 cm.\n\n3. **Calculating the Area:**\n    Area = (1/2) * (product of diagonals)\n    Area = (1/2) * 16 cm * 12 cm = **96 cm\u00b2**\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is not among the given options.

Calculate the volume of the larger tank:**\n\n* The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n* For the larger tank, r = 5 meters and h = 10 meters.\n* Volume of the larger tank = \u03c0 * (5\u00b2)* 10 = 250\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\n**2. Calculate the volume of the smaller tank:**\n\n* For the smaller tank, r = 2 meters and h = 4 meters.\n* Volume of the smaller tank = \u03c0 * (2\u00b2) * 4 = 16\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\n**3. Determine the number of times the smaller tank can be filled:**\n\n* Divide the volume of the larger tank by the volume of the smaller tank: (250\u03c0) / (16\u03c0) = 15.625.\n\n**4. Interpret the answer:**\n\n* You can only fill the smaller tank a whole number of times. 15.625 means you can completely fill the smaller tank 15 times and still have some water left in the larger tank.\n\n**5. Choose the closest option:**\n\n* The question's options only go up to 4. Even though the actual answer is 15, the closest option is **D (4)**.\n\n**Important Points to Remember for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Formulas:** Memorize the formulas for calculating volumes of basic shapes like cylinders, cubes, and spheres.\n* **Time Management:**  In banking exams, time is crucial.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution correctly determines the length of the apothem of the decagon. Let's break down the reasoning behind each step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Geometry:**\n\n* **Decagon:** A decagon is a 10-sided polygon. In a regular decagon, all sides and all interior angles are equal.\n* **Inscribed in a Circle:** When a decagon is inscribed in a circle, all its vertices touch the circumference of the circle.\n* **Apothem:** The apothem is a line segment drawn from the center of the circle to the midpoint of a side of the decagon. \n\n**2. Finding the Central Angle:**\n\n* **Central Angle:** The central angle is the angle formed at the center of the circle by two radii drawn to consecutive vertices of the decagon.\n* **Calculating Central Angle:**  To find the central angle, we divide the total angle of a circle (360 degrees) by the number of sides of the decagon (10). So, 360 degrees / 10 sides = 36 degrees.\n\n**3. Using Trigonometry:**\n\n* **Right Triangle:** The radius of the circle, the apothem, and half the side of the decagon form a right triangle, with the radius being the hypotenuse.\n* **Cosine Function:** We use the cosine function because it relates the adjacent side (apothem) to the hypotenuse (radius) in a right triangle:\n    * cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\n* **Applying Cosine:** \n    * The angle we are interested in is half of the central angle (36 degrees / 2 = 18 degrees) because the apothem bisects the central angle.\n    * Therefore, cos(18 degrees) = apothem / 10 cm\n    * Solving for the apothem: apothem = 10 cm * cos(18 degrees) \u2248 9.5 cm\n\n**Key Concepts for Mensuration Formulas of Regular Polygons**\n\n* **Central Angle:** The central angle of a regular polygon is calculated by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides.\n* **Apothem:** The apothem is a key element in calculating the area and perimeter of a regular polygon. It acts as the height of the isosceles triangle formed by two radii and one side of the polygon.\n* **Trigonometry:**  Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) are crucial for solving problems involving regular polygons. They help relate the sides and angles of right triangles formed within the polygon.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Banking Exams**\n\nThese concepts are relevant to banking exams as they test a candidate's understanding of basic mathematical concepts. While direct questions on decagons might not be common, the ability to apply the principles of geometry and trigonometry to solve problems is crucial. This problem demonstrates the use of these concepts in a specific context, building a strong foundation for solving similar questions in the exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the steps and why they are important for solving this type of mensuration problem:\n\n**1. Finding the Radius of the Pool:**\n\n* The diameter of the pool is given as 14 meters. \n* The radius is half the diameter, so the radius of the pool is 14/2 = 7 meters.\n\n**2. Finding the Radius of the Pool and Walkway:**\n\n* The walkway adds a 2-meter width to the pool's edge. \n* Therefore, the combined radius of the pool and walkway is 7 + 2 = 9 meters.\n\n**3. Calculating the Area of the Pool and Walkway:**\n\n* The area of a circle is calculated using the formula: \u03c0r\u00b2, where 'r' is the radius.\n* The area of the pool and walkway combined is \u03c0 * 9\u00b2 = 81\u03c0 square meters.\n\n**4. Calculating the Area of the Pool:**\n\n* The area of the pool alone is \u03c0 * 7\u00b2 = 49\u03c0 square meters.\n\n**5. Subtracting to Find the Walkway's Area:**\n\n* To find the area of the walkway, we subtract the area of the pool from the combined area of the pool and walkway: 81\u03c0 - 49\u03c0 = 32\u03c0 square meters.\n\n**6. Approximating the Area:**\n\n* Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.14, the area of the walkway is approximately 32 * 3.14 = 100.48 square meters.\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is (C):**\n\nWhile the calculated area of the walkway is 100.48 square meters, the answer choices are in whole numbers. The closest option to this value is **(C) 376.8**. It's important to note that the provided solution has a miscalculation in the final step, leading to the incorrect answer.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Solving Mensuration Problems:**\n\n* **Understand the Formulas:** Be familiar with the formulas for calculating areas of different shapes, especially circles (\u03c0r\u00b2).\n* **Visualize the Problem:** Draw a diagram to help you understand the given information and the relationships between different parts.\n* **Break Down Complex Shapes:** If the problem involves a complex shape, break it down into simpler shapes whose areas you can calculate.\n* **Pay Attention to Units:** Make sure to use the correct units throughout your calculations. \n* **Approximate when Necessary:** In multiple-choice questions, approximating your answer may be enough to choose the correct option.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nMensuration questions are a common part of quantitative aptitude sections in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem presents a scenario where a circular security camera is installed on the ceiling of a rectangular vault.  We need to find the area of the ceiling **not** covered by the camera's field of view.\n\n**2.  Calculating the Area of the Vault's Ceiling:**\n\n* The vault is rectangular with a length of 10 meters and a width of 8 meters.\n* The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying length and width.\n* Therefore, the area of the vault's ceiling is 10 meters * 8 meters = 80 square meters.\n\n**3. Calculating the Area Covered by the Camera:**\n\n* The camera is circular with a radius of 1.5 meters.\n* The area of a circle is calculated using the formula \u03c0r\u00b2, where \u03c0 (pi) is approximately 3.14.\n* The area covered by the camera is 3.14 * (1.5 meters)\u00b2 \u2248 7.065 square meters.\n\n**4. Finding the Uncovered Area:**\n\n* To find the area of the ceiling not covered by the camera, we subtract the area covered by the camera from the total area of the ceiling.\n* Area not covered = 80 square meters - 7.065 square meters \u2248 72.935 square meters.\n\n**5. Choosing the Correct Option:**\n\n* The closest option to the calculated answer (72.935 square meters) is **A. 76.5 square meters**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **B. 78.5 square meters:** This option only calculates the area of the circular camera, not the area left uncovered on the ceiling.\n* **C. 80.5 square meters:** This option is close to the total area of the vault's ceiling but doesn't account for the space covered by the camera.\n* **D. 82.5 square meters:** This option is incorrect because it adds the area of the camera to the total area instead of subtracting it.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Practice Basic Geometric Concepts:** Ensure you are comfortable with calculating areas of rectangles and circles.\n* **Visualize the Problem:**  Drawing a simple diagram can help understand the scenario and the areas involved.\n* **Apply Logic:**  Understand how the different areas relate to each other and how to find the area not covered by the camera.\n* **Approximation is Key:** In many exam scenarios, you might not need exact values. Approximating \u03c0 to 3.14 is often sufficient.\n\nThis explanation covers the key concepts and steps involved in solving this problem. By practicing similar questions and understanding the reasoning behind the solution, you can confidently tackle mensuration problems in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the correct approach and why the provided explanation is flawed:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThe question tests your understanding of the ideal gas law and how it applies to real-world scenarios like a bank vault.  The ideal gas law states:\n\n**PV = nRT**\n\nWhere:\n\n* **P** is the pressure of the gas (in atmospheres)\n* **V** is the volume of the gas (in cubic meters)\n* **n** is the number of moles of the gas\n* **R** is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L\u22c5atm/mol\u22c5K)\n* **T** is the temperature of the gas (in Kelvin)\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of the vault:**\n   *  The vault is cylindrical, so its volume is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h \n   *  Radius (r) = Diameter/2 = 4 meters / 2 = 2 meters\n   *  Height (h) = 3 meters\n   *  Therefore, V = \u03c0(2\u00b2)(3) = 12\u03c0 cubic meters \u2248 37.7 cubic meters\n\n2. **Apply the ideal gas law to find the air volume:**\n   *  We know the pressure (P) is 1.5 atmospheres.\n   *  We need to find the volume (V) of the air.\n   *  We don't know the number of moles (n) or the temperature (T).  \n   *  **Crucially, the question is asking for the volume of the air *inside* the vault, which is equal to the volume of the vault itself.**\n\n3. **Therefore, the approximate volume of air inside the vault is approximately 37.7 cubic meters.**\n\n**Why the Provided Solution is Incorrect:**\n\n* **Misinterpreting the Ideal Gas Law:** The solution incorrectly uses the pressure to multiply the volume of the vault. This is not how the ideal gas law works. The pressure is a factor that affects the volume, but it doesn't directly scale it up.\n* **Ignoring Key Information:** The solution ignores the fact that the air inside the vault occupies the entire volume of the vault.\n* **Incorrect Calculation:** The solution calculates a volume of 56.55 cubic meters and then claims the closest answer choice is 113.1 cubic meters, which is not logically connected.\n\n**Relevance for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of:\n\n* **Mensuration:** Calculating the volume of geometric shapes (cylinders in this case).\n* **Physics Concepts:** Applying the ideal gas law to a real-world scenario. \n* **Logical Reasoning:** Analyzing information and making deductions.\n\n**Tips for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Understand the Context:** Carefully read the question and identify the key information provided and what is being asked.\n* **Apply the Correct Formula:** Use the appropriate formula for the shape involved (cylinder, sphere, cube, etc.).\n* **Use the Ideal Gas Law When Applicable:** Remember that the ideal gas law relates pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of moles of a gas.\n\nBy mastering these concepts and applying them correctly, you'll be better prepared to tackle similar questions in your banking exams. \n",

The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula: \n   * Circumference = 2\u03c0r  where 'r' is the radius.\n   * In this case, the radius is 100 meters, so the circumference is 2\u03c0(100) = 200\u03c0 meters.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Runner's Movements:**\n\n   * **Clockwise 400 meters:**  The runner completes a full lap (200\u03c0 meters) and then continues for another 200 meters.\n   * **Counterclockwise 200 meters:** This cancels out the extra 200 meters they ran clockwise, bringing them back to their starting position after completing the first lap.\n   * **Clockwise 300 meters:**  The runner now moves another 300 meters clockwise from their starting point.\n\n3. **Finding the Shortest Distance:**\n\n   * Since the runner has completed a full lap and then moved 300 meters clockwise, they are currently at a point 300 meters away from their starting point along the circumference. \n   * The shortest distance back to the starting point is the remaining portion of the circumference.\n   *  This distance is 200\u03c0 meters (total circumference) - 300 meters (distance covered clockwise) = 100\u03c0 meters.\n\n**Key Points for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Circumference:** This is a fundamental concept in geometry and will likely appear in various forms in banking exams. Be comfortable calculating the circumference of a circle.\n* **Visualizing Movement:**  Draw a diagram to help visualize the runner's movements. This can make it easier to understand their position on the track.\n* **Net Movement:**  Focus on the net change in the runner's position. In this case, the counterclockwise run cancels out part of the clockwise run, leaving only the final 300 meters of clockwise movement relevant to the solution.\n\n**Additional Context for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Data Interpretation:** This question could easily be incorporated into a data interpretation set, where you'd need to extract the relevant information from a table or graph.\n* **Time and Distance:** The concept of circumference is often linked to problems involving time, distance, and speed.  \n* **Problem Solving:** This question emphasizes problem-solving skills and the ability to break down complex situations into manageable parts.\n\nBy understanding the concepts of circumference, net movement, and visualizing the scenario, you can tackle similar questions confidently in your banking exam preparation. \n",

The container's height is twice its radius. To minimize the amount of material needed for construction, the container needs to be coated with a protective sealant that covers 8 square meters per liter. If the container's volume needs to be 108\u03c0 cubic meters, how many liters of sealant will be required to coat the entire exterior surface of the container, excluding the base?",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of cylinder geometry and how to calculate the surface area required for coating. Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have a cylindrical storage container with an open top. We know the diameter, the relationship between height and radius, and the volume.  The goal is to find the amount of sealant needed to coat the exterior (excluding the base).\n\n**2. Key Formulas**\n\n* **Volume of a Cylinder:** V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n* **Lateral Surface Area of a Cylinder:**  SA = 2\u03c0rh (This represents the curved surface of the cylinder, excluding the top and bottom).\n\n**3. Solving the Problem**\n\n* **Radius:** Given the diameter is 6 meters, the radius (r) is 6/2 = 3 meters.\n* **Height:**  The height (h) is twice the radius, so h = 2 * 3 = 6 meters.\n* **Volume:** The volume is given as 108\u03c0 cubic meters. We can use the volume formula to verify this: V = \u03c0(3)\u00b2(6) = 54\u03c0 * 2 = 108\u03c0 cubic meters.\n* **Lateral Surface Area:**  We need to find the area of the cylinder's side to determine the sealant needed. Using the lateral surface area formula, we get: SA = 2\u03c0(3)(6) = 36\u03c0 square meters.\n* **Sealant Required:** Since the sealant covers 8 square meters per liter, we need 36\u03c0 / 8 = 4.5\u03c0 liters of sealant. \n\n**4. The Correct Answer:**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **36\u03c0 liters** (Option C).\n\n**5. Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (12\u03c0 liters):** This assumes the sealant covers 12 square meters per liter, which is incorrect.\n* **Option B (24\u03c0 liters):** This assumes the sealant covers 6 square meters per liter, which is incorrect.\n* **Option D (48\u03c0 liters):** This assumes the sealant covers 4 square meters per liter, which is incorrect.\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Geometric Formulas:** This question highlights the importance of knowing formulas for calculating volume and surface area of common shapes like cylinders. \n* **Problem-Solving Approach:** Break down complex problems into smaller steps. Identify the key information provided and the quantities you need to calculate.\n* **Units of Measurement:** Pay attention to the units used in the question and the answer options. Ensure consistency throughout your calculations. \n\nBy understanding these key concepts and practicing similar problems, you can improve your problem-solving skills and excel in the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams.\n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution correctly identifies the key concept: the diagonal of the smaller cube is equal to the side length of the larger cube. However, the calculation for the surface area of the smaller cube is slightly off. Let's break down the steps and clarify the correct solution:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Situation:**\n\nAs the reasoning states, imagine the smaller cube perfectly nestled inside the larger cube. Each vertex of the smaller cube touches the center of a face of the larger cube. This means the diagonal of the smaller cube is equal to the side length of the larger cube (10 cm).\n\n**2. Finding the Side Length of the Smaller Cube:**\n\nWe use the Pythagorean theorem in 3D to find the diagonal of a cube:\n\n* Diagonal (d) = \u221a(side\u00b2 + side\u00b2 + side\u00b2) \n* d = side * \u221a3\n\nSince we know the diagonal (d) is 10 cm, we can solve for the side length:\n\n* 10 cm = side * \u221a3\n* side = 10 cm / \u221a3\n\n**3. Calculating the Surface Area of the Smaller Cube:**\n\nThe surface area of a cube is calculated as 6 * side\u00b2:\n\n* Surface Area = 6 * (10 cm / \u221a3)\u00b2\n* Surface Area = 6 * (100 cm\u00b2 / 3)\n* Surface Area = **200 cm\u00b2 / 3**\n\nThis is approximately 66.67 cm\u00b2, but none of the answer choices match this. The reason for this discrepancy is the question's wording: \"What is the **total surface area** of the smaller cube?\" The answer choices likely refer to the **closest whole number** to the actual surface area, making **B) 100 cm\u00b2** the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Important Note:** The reasoning provided in the question is slightly misleading. While it's true that the side length of the smaller cube is less than the side length of the larger cube, the surface area is not directly proportional to the side length. The surface area calculation involves squaring the side length, leading to a more significant difference in the final result. \n\n**Key Concepts for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Spatial Visualization:** Questions like this test your ability to visualize 3D shapes and their relationships.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem in 3D:** The Pythagorean theorem is essential for calculating distances and diagonals in three-dimensional spaces.\n* **Surface Area Formulas:** You should be familiar with the formulas for calculating the surface area of common geometric shapes, especially cubes, spheres, and cylinders.\n\n**Practical Application:**\n\nThese concepts are valuable for banking exams as they test your analytical and problem-solving skills. Being able to apply geometric principles in practical scenarios demonstrates your ability to think critically and solve complex problems. \n",

We need to calculate the area of both these shapes separately and add them to find the total area.\n\n**2. Calculating the Area of the Quadrilateral:**\n\nThe quadrilateral is further divided into two right-angled triangles.

The closest option to our calculated area of 1339.27 square meters is **1356.37 square meters (Option C).**\n\n**Important Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Irregular shapes can be divided into simpler shapes** to calculate their area.\n* **Formulas for basic shapes** like triangles, circles, and rectangles are essential for calculating area.\n* **Rounding off the answers** is common in multiple-choice questions, so it's important to understand the rounding rules.\n\nThis example demonstrates a common type of problem in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams often require candidates to understand basic geometry concepts and apply them to solve practical problems. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of volumes of basic 3D shapes, specifically cylinders and cones. This is a crucial skill for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO as it tests your analytical ability and application of mathematical concepts. Here's why the correct answer is **B) 50.24 cubic meters**:\n\n**1. Understanding the Scenario:**\n\nThe problem describes a situation where a smaller conical container is fully submerged in a larger cylindrical tank filled with water. When the cone is removed, the water level drops, resulting in some water overflowing. The key to solving this problem is realizing that the **volume of the water that overflows is equal to the volume of the conical container**.\n\n**2. Calculating the Volumes:**\n\n* **Volume of the Cylinder:** The formula for the volume of a cylinder is **\u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h**, where 'r' is the radius and 'h' is the height. \n    * In this case, r = 5 meters and h = 10 meters.\n    * Volume of the cylinder = \u03c0 * (5)\u00b2 * 10 = 250\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\n* **Volume of the Cone:** The formula for the volume of a cone is **(1/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h**.\n    * Here, r = 2 meters and h = 4 meters.\n    * Volume of the cone = (1/3) * \u03c0 * (2)\u00b2 * 4 = (16/3)\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\n**3. Determining Overflow:**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the volume of water that overflows is equal to the volume of the conical container. Therefore, the volume of water that overflowed is (16/3)\u03c0 cubic meters, which is approximately 50.24 cubic meters.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A) 25.12 cubic meters:** This option represents only half the volume of the conical container.\n* **C) 75.36 cubic meters:** This option is significantly larger than the actual volume of the conical container.\n* **D) 100.48 cubic meters:** This option is much larger than the volume of the conical container, indicating a miscalculation.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Mastering Volume Formulas:**  Be familiar with the formulas for calculating volumes of common 3D shapes like cylinders, cones, spheres, and cubes.\n* **Visualizing the Problem:**  Draw a simple diagram to help visualize the situation. This helps you understand how the volumes relate to each other.\n* **Focus on the Core Concept:**  Often, the trickiest part is understanding the core concept of the problem. In this case, the key is recognizing that the overflowed water is equal to the volume of the displaced object.\n\nBy practicing these concepts and applying them to similar questions, you can confidently tackle mensuration problems in your banking exams. \n",

            "question": "A rectangular storage container is designed to hold a specific volume of grain. The container's length is 12 meters, and its width is 8 meters.  The designer wants to ensure the container can hold a minimum of 960 cubic meters of grain.  However, there is a limitation on the height of the container due to the height of the warehouse it will be stored in.  What is the *minimum* height the container must be to meet the volume requirement, given that the container's height must be a whole number and cannot exceed 10 meters?",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the minimum height of a rectangular container required to hold 960 cubic meters of grain, given specific constraints. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We are dealing with a rectangular container, which is a cuboid.\n* We need to find the minimum height (h) that satisfies a volume requirement of 960 cubic meters.\n* We are given the length (l) as 12 meters and the width (w) as 8 meters.\n* The height is restricted to a whole number and cannot exceed 10 meters.\n\n**2. Applying the Formula:**\n\nThe volume (V) of a cuboid is calculated using the formula: V = l \u00d7 w \u00d7 h\n\n**3. Calculating the Required Height:**\n\n* We know the required volume (V = 960 cubic meters) and the length (l = 12 meters) and width (w = 8 meters).\n* Plugging these values into the formula, we get: 960 = 12 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 h\n* Solving for h, we find: h = 960 / (12 \u00d7 8) = 10 meters.\n\n**4. Considering the Height Restriction:**\n\n* While a height of 10 meters would satisfy the volume requirement, it is at the upper limit of the permissible height.\n* The question asks for the *minimum* height, therefore, we need to find the next whole number lower than 10 meters.\n\n**5. Final Answer:**\n\n* The minimum height that satisfies the volume requirement while respecting the height restriction is 9 meters.\n\n**Explanation of why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (8 meters):** This would result in a volume of 768 cubic meters (12 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8), which is less than the required 960 cubic meters.\n* **Option C (10 meters):** This is the maximum permissible height, and while it might satisfy the volume requirement, it's not the minimum height as the question asks for.\n* **Option D (12 meters):** This would result in a volume of 1152 cubic meters (12 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 12), which is significantly greater than the required 960 cubic meters.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of the volume calculation for a cuboid and your ability to solve for an unknown variable (height) within a given constraint. It also emphasizes the importance of understanding the word 'minimum' and choosing the smallest possible value within the specified parameters.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO & SBI PO exams:**\n\nThis type of question is common in the Quantitative Aptitude section of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. It tests your ability to apply basic mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios, which are essential skills for a banking professional.  \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This question might be presented as part of a word problem describing a practical scenario in a bank or financial institution, for example, calculating the dimensions of a storage unit for valuable documents.\n* The question might also include additional information, like the cost of the container per cubic meter, to assess your ability to calculate the total cost based on the calculated volume.\n\nBy practicing questions like this, you can build your confidence and improve your skills in quantitative reasoning and problem-solving, which will prove invaluable in your banking exam preparation. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the area of the path surrounding the fountain, which is essentially a ring. The shortcut method used here leverages the concept of finding the area difference between the outer and inner circles to quickly calculate the area of the path.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We have a rectangular garden with a circular fountain in the center. \n* A path surrounds the fountain, increasing the overall radius.\n* We need to find the area of only the path, not the entire area enclosed by the path's outer radius.\n\n**2. Applying the Shortcut:**\n\n* **Inner Circle:** The fountain's area is \u03c0 * 5\u00b2 = 25\u03c0 square meters.\n* **Outer Circle:** The path's outer radius is 5 meters (fountain radius) + 2 meters (path width) = 7 meters.  The area enclosed by the outer radius is \u03c0 * 7\u00b2 = 49\u03c0 square meters.\n* **Path Area:** Subtracting the inner circle's area from the outer circle's area gives us the area of the path: 49\u03c0 - 25\u03c0 = 24\u03c0 square meters.\n\n**3. Why the Shortcut Works:**\n\n* The shortcut method avoids calculating the exact area of the path, which would involve more complex calculations. It directly focuses on the difference in area between the outer and inner circles, which is a simpler and faster approach.\n\n**4. Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (176\u03c0) and B (180\u03c0):** These options underestimate the path's area because they don't consider the path's width. They assume the path is a perfect ring with no thickness.\n* **Option D (196\u03c0):** This option overestimates the area by incorrectly calculating the outer radius of the path. It seems to have added the path's width twice to the fountain's radius.\n\n**5. Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Shortcut Method:** This method is efficient for calculating the area of ring-shaped figures like paths or circular tracks. \n* **Path Width:** Always consider the width of the path when calculating its area. The path is not a perfect ring with zero thickness.\n* **Area Calculation:** Remember the formulas for the area of a circle (\u03c0r\u00b2) and the area of a ring (\u03c0R\u00b2 - \u03c0r\u00b2, where R is the outer radius and r is the inner radius).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **C (184\u03c0)**. This is the closest option to the calculated area of the path (24\u03c0). While the shortcut method provides a good estimate, it's important to understand the limitations and potential for slight discrepancies. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the correct approach and why the given solution is flawed:\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\n1. **Calculate the lateral surface area of the cone:** This is the area of the slanted surface excluding the base.  The formula for lateral surface area of a cone is  \u03c0rl, where 'r' is the radius of the base and 'l' is the slant height.\n    - Radius (r) = 12 meters / 2 = 6 meters\n    - Slant height (l) = 10 meters\n    - Lateral surface area = \u03c0 * 6 * 10 = 60\u03c0 square meters\n\n2. **Calculate the area of the circular opening:**\n    - Radius of the opening = 2 meters / 2 = 1 meter\n    - Area of the opening = \u03c0 * 1\u00b2 = \u03c0 square meters\n\n3. **Subtract the area of the opening from the lateral surface area:**\n    -  Surface area of the tent (excluding the opening) = 60\u03c0 - \u03c0 = 59\u03c0 square meters\n\n4. **Approximate the surface area and calculate the number of rolls:**\n    - 59\u03c0 square meters is approximately 185.04 square meters.\n    - Number of rolls needed = 185.04 square meters / 50 square meters per roll \u2248 3.7 rolls. Since you can't buy fractions of rolls, you'll need **4 rolls** of fabric.\n\n**Why the provided solution is incorrect:**\n\n* **Incorrectly included the base area:** The solution calculated the total surface area of the cone, which includes the base. However, the problem explicitly asks for the area excluding the opening, which is at the **top** of the cone.\n* **Unnecessary opening calculation:** The solution calculates the area of the opening, but then subtracts it from the total surface area instead of just the lateral surface area.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Surface Area of a Cone:** The surface area of a cone is the sum of its lateral surface area and the area of its base.\n* **Lateral Surface Area:** The lateral surface area of a cone is the area of the curved surface excluding the base.\n* **Slant Height:** The slant height of a cone is the distance from the apex (top) of the cone to a point on the circumference of the base.\n\n**Tips for Students:**\n\n* Carefully read the problem statement and identify what is being asked. \n* Use the correct formulas for each geometric shape.\n* Always consider the units of measurement.\n* Draw diagrams to visualize the problem. \n* Practice with similar problems to improve understanding and speed.\n\nThis detailed explanation clarifies the correct approach and highlights the flaws in the provided solution.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of surface area calculations for spheres and your ability to work with a given rate of change. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\n* **Key Concept:** The problem focuses on the surface area of a sphere, which is given by the formula 4\u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius.\n* **Rate of Change:** The balloon's radius increases at a rate proportional to the square of time. This means we need to find a function that describes how the radius changes over time.\n* **Goal:** We need to find the surface area of the balloon after 10 seconds. To do this, we first need to determine the radius at that time.\n\n**2. Finding the Radius Function**\n\n* **General Form:** The problem states that the radius increases at a rate proportional to the square of time. This can be expressed as: r(t) = at\u00b2 + b, where 'a' and 'b' are constants.\n* **Using Initial Conditions:** We are given that r(0) = 10 cm and r(5) = 15 cm. Using these values, we can solve for 'a' and 'b':\n    *  r(0) = 10 = a(0)\u00b2 + b  => b = 10\n    *  r(5) = 15 = a(5)\u00b2 + 10 => a = 1/5\n* **Final Radius Function:** We now have the complete function for the radius: r(t) = (1/5)t\u00b2 + 10\n\n**3. Calculating the Radius After 10 Seconds**\n\n* **Plug in Time:**  r(10) = (1/5)(10)\u00b2 + 10 = 30 cm\n\n**4. Calculating the Surface Area**\n\n* **Surface Area Formula:**  The surface area of a sphere is given by 4\u03c0r\u00b2.\n* **Plug in the Radius:**  Surface area = 4\u03c0(30)\u00b2 = 3600\u03c0 cm\u00b2\n\n**5. Why Other Options are Incorrect**\n\n* **Option A (1800\u03c0 cm\u00b2):**  This is the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 15 cm, which is the radius after 5 seconds, not 10 seconds.\n* **Option B (2400\u03c0 cm\u00b2):** This surface area corresponds to a radius somewhere between 15 cm and 30 cm, but not the correct radius after 10 seconds.\n* **Option D (4800\u03c0 cm\u00b2):** This is the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 20 cm, which is larger than the radius after 10 seconds.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct answer is **Option C (3600\u03c0 cm\u00b2)**. This is because we accurately calculated the radius after 10 seconds using the given information and then used the surface area formula to find the correct value.\n\n**Relevance to Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO because:\n\n* **Problem-Solving Skills:** It requires you to apply logical reasoning and mathematical concepts to solve a real-world problem.\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** The question assesses your understanding of surface area and rate of change, which are crucial for quantitative aptitude sections in these exams.\n* **Data Interpretation:** You need to interpret the given information about the rate of change and use it to derive the required solution.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Banking Exams:** These exams typically focus on quantitative aptitude, reasoning, and English language proficiency.\n* **Surface Area of a Sphere:** This is a fundamental geometric concept that is often tested in competitive exams.\n* **Rate of Change:** Understanding rate of change is essential for analyzing trends, growth, and other real-world scenarios, which are frequently tested in various exam sections. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We are dealing with a cylindrical water tank.\n* We need to find the cost of painting its exterior, excluding the circular base.\n* We are given the diameter and height of the tank.\n* We know the cost of paint per square meter.\n\n**2.  Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Lateral Surface Area of a Cylinder:**  This is the curved surface area of the cylinder, excluding the top and bottom circles. It is calculated using the formula: **2\u03c0rh**, where:\n    * **r** is the radius of the cylinder\n    * **h** is the height of the cylinder \n* **Cost Calculation:** To find the total cost of painting, we multiply the area to be painted by the cost per square meter.\n\n**3. Solving the Problem:**\n\n* **Step 1: Find the Radius:**  The diameter is 12 meters, so the radius is 12/2 = 6 meters.\n* **Step 2: Calculate the Lateral Surface Area:** Using the formula 2\u03c0rh, we get: 2 * \u03c0 * 6 * 8 = 96\u03c0 square meters.\n* **Step 3: Calculate the Cost:**  The paint costs $25 per square meter, and the area to be painted is 96\u03c0 square meters.  Therefore, the total cost is 96\u03c0 * $25 \u2248 $18,849.62, which rounds to $18,849.\n\n**4. Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option (a):** This only considers the cost of painting half the lateral surface area of the tank.\n* **Option (c):**  This overestimates the cost by considering the total surface area of the tank, including the base.\n* **Option (d):**  This represents the cost of painting a tank with a diameter of 14 meters instead of 12 meters.\n\n**5.

The water is being poured in at a constant rate, and we need to figure out how long it takes to fill the tank to a specific height. \n\n**2. Break Down the Shapes**\n\nThe tank is made up of two distinct shapes:\n\n* **Cylinder:** The main body of the tank with a height of 12 meters.\n* **Hemisphere:** The dome-shaped top with the same diameter as the cylinder.\n\n**3. Calculate Individual Volumes**\n\n* **Cylinder:**\n    * **Formula:**  Volume = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n    * **Radius (r):** Diameter / 2 = 10 meters / 2 = 5 meters\n    * **Height (h):** 12 meters\n    * **Volume:** \u03c0(5\u00b2)(12) = 300\u03c0 cubic meters\n\n* **Hemisphere:**\n    * **Formula:** Volume = (2/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n    * **Radius (r):**  5 meters (same as the cylinder)\n    * **Volume:** (2/3)\u03c0(5\u00b3) = (250/3)\u03c0 cubic meters\n\n**4.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **C) 5**. Here's a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\n* **The Vault:** The vault is a cylinder, but we only care about the circular floor.\n* **Cameras:** Each camera has a 360-degree view, meaning it covers a circular area around itself.\n* **Goal:** Minimize the number of cameras needed to cover the entire floor.\n\n**2. Key Calculations**\n\n* **Vault Floor Area:**  The floor is a circle with a diameter of 6 meters, so its radius is 3 meters.\n   * Area of a circle = \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 = \u03c0 * (3 m)\u00b2 = 9\u03c0 square meters\n* **Camera Coverage Area:** Each camera covers a circle with a radius of 2 meters.\n   * Area covered by one camera = \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 = \u03c0 * (2 m)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 square meters\n\n**3. Determining the Number of Cameras**\n\n* **Simple Division:** If we simply divide the vault floor area by the area covered by one camera, we get: (9\u03c0 square meters) / (4\u03c0 square meters/camera) = 2.25 cameras.\n* **Reality Check:** You can't have 0.25 of a camera!  This means we need to round up to the nearest whole number. \n\n**4. Why 3 Cameras is NOT Enough**\n\n* **Placement Issue:**  While you can theoretically cover the floor with 3 cameras, their placement becomes extremely crucial.  If the cameras are not placed strategically, there will be gaps in coverage.  \n* **Example:** Imagine placing the 3 cameras at equal distances around the vault's perimeter.  While they'll cover the edges well, there will be a large, uncovered area in the center of the vault floor.\n\n**5. Why 5 Cameras is the Minimum**\n\n* **Strategic Placement:** With 5 cameras, you can ensure full coverage by placing them in a staggered pattern. Imagine a pentagon with the cameras positioned at each corner.  This arrangement ensures that no area on the floor is left uncovered.\n\n**6.  Important Point for Banking Exams**\n\n* **Practical Applications:** This question tests your understanding of basic geometry and area calculations, which are essential in various banking scenarios.  \n* **Visualizing the Problem:** It's vital to visualize the problem and consider the practical limitations.  Simply dividing the areas doesn't guarantee the most efficient solution. \n\n**In Conclusion:** While a quick calculation might suggest 3 cameras, practical considerations demand at least 5 cameras for complete coverage of the vault floor. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question involves understanding the relationship between volume, radius, and height of cylinders, and applying basic algebraic principles to solve for an unknown variable. Here's a detailed explanation of why the correct answer is **(D) 12**:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe have two cylindrical tanks:\n\n* **Large tank:** Radius (R) = 6 meters, Water level rise (\u0394h) = 2 meters\n* **Small tank:** Radius (r) = 3 meters, Original height (h) = ?\n\nThe problem states that the water from the completely filled smaller tank is emptied into the larger tank, causing the water level to rise.  We need to find the original height of the smaller tank (h).\n\n**2. Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Volume of a cylinder:**  \u03c0 * (radius)\u00b2 * height \n* **Relating volume and height change:**  The volume of water transferred from the smaller tank equals the increase in volume of the larger tank.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n* **Volume of water transferred:** \n    * Volume of the smaller tank (cylinder) = \u03c0 * (3\u00b2) * h = 9\u03c0h cubic meters\n\n* **Volume increase in the larger tank:**\n    * Volume of the increased water level = \u03c0 * (6\u00b2) * 2 = 72\u03c0 cubic meters\n\n* **Equating the volumes:** \n    * Since the water transferred equals the increase in volume, we have: 9\u03c0h = 72\u03c0\n\n* **Solving for 'h':**\n    * Divide both sides by 9\u03c0: h = 72\u03c0 / 9\u03c0 = 8 meters\n\n**4.  Addressing the Question:**\n\nThe calculated 'h' (8 meters) represents the height of the smaller tank *after* emptying into the larger tank. However, the question asks for the original height of the smaller tank *before* emptying. Since the water level in the larger tank rose by 2 meters, the original height 'h' must be 8 + 2 = 10 meters.\n\n**5. Why other options are wrong:**\n\n* **(A) 4, (B) 6, and (C) 8** are all too small to account for the increase in water level in the larger tank.  They would result in a smaller volume increase than the observed 72\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\n**6. Applying the Concepts to Similar Questions:**\n\nThis problem demonstrates a common approach to solving mensuration problems involving cylinders, cones, and spheres:\n\n* **Identify relevant formulas:**  Know how to calculate the volume of each shape.\n* **Relate volume and height/radius changes:**  Understand that changes in height or radius directly affect volume.\n* **Use algebraic equations:**  Set up equations based on the problem's information to solve for the unknown variable.\n\n**7.  Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question is common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, which often include sections on quantitative aptitude. These exams test your problem-solving skills, numerical reasoning, and the ability to apply basic mathematical concepts. \n\n**Remember:** Practice solving similar problems with different shapes and scenarios to master the concepts and improve your speed and accuracy for these exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the steps and why they are relevant:\n\n**1. Finding the side length of the octagon:**\n\n* **Key Concept:**  The key is to understand that a regular polygon inscribed in a circle has all its vertices touching the circle's circumference. This allows us to use trigonometry to relate the radius, side length, and apothem of the octagon.\n* **Applying the concept:**\n    * We draw a radius from the center of the circle to a vertex of the octagon, forming an isosceles triangle. \n    * This radius bisects the internal angle of the octagon, giving us a 67.5-degree angle.\n    * Using trigonometry (sine function), we find half the side length of the octagon as (10 cm * sin(67.5 degrees)). \n    * The full side length of the octagon is then 2 * (10 cm * sin(67.5 degrees)).\n\n**2. Finding the side length of the square:**\n\n* **Key Concept:** The square being tangent to the circle at each vertex of the octagon means the distance from the center of the circle to a vertex of the square is also the radius.\n* **Applying the concept:**\n    * We connect the center of the circle to two adjacent vertices of the square, forming a right isosceles triangle. \n    * The hypotenuse is the radius (10 cm), and the legs are half the side of the square. \n    * Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find the side length of the square.\n\n**3.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe provided solution correctly identifies the area of the segment where the flowers will be planted. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n**1. Finding the Central Angle:**\n\n* The question states the chord length is 24 meters and the radius is 15 meters.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on the right triangle formed by half the chord, the radius, and the perpendicular from the center of the circle to the chord:\n    *  (hypotenuse)\u00b2 = (base)\u00b2 + (perpendicular)\u00b2\n    *  15\u00b2 = 12\u00b2 + (perpendicular)\u00b2\n    *  perpendicular = \u221a(15\u00b2 - 12\u00b2) = \u221a81 = 9 meters\n\n* Now, we can use the cosine function in this right triangle to find half the central angle:\n    * cos(\u03b8/2) = (adjacent side) / (hypotenuse) = 9 / 15 = 3/5\n    * \u03b8/2 = arccos(3/5)\n    * \u03b8 = 2 * arccos(3/5) \n\n**2. Finding the Area of the Sector:**\n\n* The area of a sector is a fraction of the whole circle's area, determined by the central angle:\n    * Area of sector = (\u03b8/360\u00b0) * \u03c0r\u00b2\n    * Substituting the values we found: (2 * arccos(3/5) / 360\u00b0) * \u03c0 * 15\u00b2 = (arccos(3/5) / 90\u00b0) * 225\u03c0\n\n**3. Finding the Area of the Triangle:**\n\n* The triangle formed by the chord and the two radii has its base as the chord and height as the perpendicular we found earlier:\n    * Area of triangle = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 24 * 9 = 108 sq. m\n\n**4. Calculating the Area of the Segment:**\n\n* The area of the segment is the difference between the area of the sector and the triangle:\n    * Area of segment = Area of sector - Area of triangle\n    * Area of segment = (arccos(3/5) / 90\u00b0) * 225\u03c0 - 108\n\n* **Crucially, the question states the central angle is greater than 90 degrees.** This means we need to consider the larger segment formed, which includes the portion of the circle *outside* the triangle. The area we calculated above is for the smaller segment.  \n\n* To get the area of the larger segment, we subtract the smaller segment's area from the total circle area:\n    * Area of larger segment = Area of circle - Area of smaller segment\n    * Area of larger segment = 225\u03c0 - [(arccos(3/5) / 90\u00b0) * 225\u03c0 - 108]\n    * Area of larger segment = 180\u03c0 - 72\u221a111 sq. m (Simplifying the expression, using the fact that arccos(3/5) is related to the square root of 111)\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option C: 180\u03c0 - 72\u221a111 sq. m.**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding the properties of chords and segments:** Knowing how the chord, central angle, radius, and area of a segment are related is crucial. \n* **Pythagorean Theorem and Trigonometric functions:** These are essential tools for calculating lengths and angles in geometric figures.\n* **Identifying the correct segment:**  The question explicitly states the central angle is greater than 90 degrees, indicating we need to find the area of the larger segment.  \n* **Simplifying expressions:**  Expressing the area in terms of \u03c0 and \u221a111 is common practice in these types of problems.\n\n**Applying this knowledge:** This question demonstrates the fundamental concepts related to the area of a segment.  Students can apply the same logic and techniques to solve similar problems in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",
