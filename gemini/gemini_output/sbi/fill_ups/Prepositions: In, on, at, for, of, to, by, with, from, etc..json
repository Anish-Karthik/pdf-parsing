            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **\"of\"**. Here's why:\n\n* **Understanding Prepositions of Possession:**  Prepositions like \"of\", \"with\", \"by\" are used to show a relationship between nouns or pronouns.  \"Of\" specifically denotes possession, indicating that something belongs to someone or something else.\n\n* **Analyzing the Sentence:** The sentence describes a necklace and its ownership. We need a preposition to connect the necklace to its owner, the grandmother.\n\n* **Why \"of\" is Correct:**  \"Of\"  indicates possession, showing that the necklace belongs to the grandmother. The sentence essentially means \"The beautiful necklace that belongs to her grandmother is a family heirloom.\"\n\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    * **\"with\"** suggests accompanying or having something, which doesn't fit the sentence's meaning.\n    * **\"by\"** suggests something was done or created by someone, which doesn't apply to the necklace's ownership.\n    * **\"from\"** indicates origin or source, which isn't relevant to the sentence's context.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  Understanding prepositions of possession is crucial for constructing grammatically correct sentences. \"Of\" is commonly used to express ownership, while other prepositions have different meanings and should be chosen carefully based on the context.\n\n**Additional Context:** \n\n* **Common Prepositions of Possession:** \"Of,\" \"to,\" \"for,\" \"with,\" \"by,\" \"from\"\n* **Examples:** \n    * The house **of** my grandparents is in the village.\n    * The book **to** the left is yours. \n    * This present is **for** you.\n    * The letter **by** the door is addressed to you.\n    * The gift **from** her friend was a surprise.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\nThese prepositions are tested in the English language section of these exams.  Knowing their meanings and usage is essential for achieving a good score. Practice with various sentence structures and learn to identify the appropriate prepositions for different contexts. \n",

Here's why:\n\n* **Understanding the Sentence:** The sentence describes a child moving from one point on the sidewalk to another. \n* **Preposition 'Across':** The preposition \"across\" signifies movement from one side to the other, directly traversing a surface like a sidewalk. \n* **Eliminating Other Options:**\n    * **\"Up\" and \"Down\"** imply vertical movement, not relevant to walking on a sidewalk.\n    * **\"Around\"** suggests a circular path, which doesn't fit the context of reaching a friend directly.\n\n**Why this matters for IBPS PO & SBI PO:**\n\nThese exams often test your understanding of basic English grammar, including prepositions.

Here, the subject is \"I\", the verb is \"went\", and the object is \"the store\". The preposition \"to\" connects the verb \"went\" to the purpose of going to the store, which is \"buy some milk\".\n\n* **Why \"to\" is Correct:**\n    * \"To\" is the most concise and natural preposition to use in this context. It directly and clearly expresses the purpose of the action (going to the store) - to buy milk.\n    * \"For\" is not the correct choice here because it's typically used to express a benefit or reason for something, not the direct purpose of an action. For example, \"I went to the store **for** some groceries.\"\n    * \"In order to\" is more formal and emphasizes the intentionality of the action, but it's not necessary in this simple sentence. You could say \"I went to the store **in order to** buy some milk,\" but \"to\" is the more common and concise choice.\n\n* **Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**  Knowing prepositions is essential for understanding grammar and forming grammatically correct sentences.

The sentence doesn't imply the children were playing next to the park, but rather inside it.\n    * **\"With\"** signifies accompaniment or a tool used.

Here's why:\n\n* **Understanding Prepositions of Comparison:** Prepositions of comparison are words that connect a noun or pronoun to another noun or pronoun, showing how they are similar. The most common prepositions of comparison are \"like\" and \"as\".  \"Than\" is used for comparison of degree or quantity.\n\n* **\"Like\" vs. \"As\":** \n    * **\"Like\"** is used to compare things that are similar in appearance, quality, or characteristic. It implies a resemblance.\n    * **\"As\"** is used to compare things that are actually the same or have a similar function. It implies an identity or equivalence.\n\n* **Applying it to the Sentence:** The sentence compares the girl's sparkling eyes to stars. The comparison is based on how they sparkle, not on being the same thing. Therefore, \"like\" is the appropriate choice because it implies a resemblance, not an identity.\n\n* **Why \"than\" is incorrect:** \"Than\" is used for comparisons of degree or quantity. For example, \"My eyes are brighter than the stars.\"  This sentence compares the brightness of the eyes to the brightness of the stars. \n\n**In summary, \"like\" is the correct answer because it accurately reflects the comparison of resemblance between the girl's sparkling eyes and stars.**\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\nPrepositions of comparison are a common topic tested in various sections of these exams, including English Language.

It essentially means \"therefore\" or \"as a result.\" In this sentence, the bright sunshine is the cause, and the decision to walk is the consequence. \n* **\"Because\"** introduces a **reason** or explanation for something.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **\"through\"** and here's why:\n\n* **Understanding the context:** The sentence describes hikers moving along a specific route, a \"narrow, winding path\". This implies a continuous movement along a defined space.\n\n* **Analyzing the preposition options:**\n\n    * **\"To\"** suggests direction, but not the actual movement along the path. It would be like saying \"The hikers carefully navigated their way to the narrow, winding path\", which doesn't capture the act of traversing it.\n    * **\"Into\"** indicates entering something.  It implies entering the path, not moving along its length. It would work if the hikers were entering a cave or forest, but not a path.\n    * **\"Onto\"** signifies moving from one surface to another. This doesn't fit the context as it implies the hikers are moving onto the path from a different surface. \n    * **\"Through\"** perfectly captures the act of moving along the length of the path, avoiding obstacles and navigating its twists and turns. It signifies continuous movement within a defined space.\n\n**Applying this to Banking Exams:**\n\nPrepositions are crucial in English grammar and can be tested extensively in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. The key to answering these questions is to understand the context and the subtle differences in meaning between prepositions.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Focus on the verb:** Pay attention to the verb (in this case, \"navigated\") as it often gives clues about the type of movement.\n* **Think about the relationship between objects:** Analyze the relationship between the subject (hikers) and the object (path) to determine the appropriate preposition. \n* **Consider the broader context:**  Read the entire sentence to understand the overall meaning and how it relates to the prepositions.\n\nBy understanding these principles and practicing with different types of questions, you'll be well-prepared to tackle preposition-related questions in your banking exams. \n",

The announcement of new economic policies is the cause, and the stock market downturn is the effect. \n* **Preposition Choice:**  The preposition we choose needs to accurately depict the temporal relationship between the announcement and the downturn. \n* **Why 'after' is Correct:**  \"After\" indicates that the downturn happened *following* the announcement. This aligns with the sentence's meaning, as the downturn is a direct consequence of the announcement. \n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    * **\"Before\"** would suggest the downturn happened *prior* to the announcement, which contradicts the sentence's meaning.\n    * **\"During\"** would suggest the downturn happened *simultaneously* with the announcement, which wouldn't necessarily make the announcement the cause of the downturn.\n\n**In essence, the sentence establishes a sequence of events: announcement, then downturn.  \"After\" accurately reflects this sequence and the causal relationship.**\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\n* **Prepositions of Time are Crucial:** Understanding prepositions like \"before\", \"after\", and \"during\" is vital for reading comprehension and sentence structure.

It would be suitable if the sentence only mentioned one specific product.\n* **\"Like\"** can be used to make a comparison, but it's not the best fit here. The sentence is not comparing the bank's products to anything else. \n* **\"As\"** is used to introduce a specific example as part of a broader comparison or definition.

Let's break down why:\n\n* **\"Due to\"** indicates that the inflation surge is the direct cause of the bank's decision. It establishes a clear connection between the two events. \n* **\"Because of\"** is also grammatically correct and conveys a similar meaning. However, \"due to\" is considered slightly more formal and is generally preferred in written contexts, especially in banking exams where precision and formality are important.\n* **\"Owing to\"** is a more formal synonym for \"due to,\" and while grammatically correct, it's not as commonly used in this specific situation compared to \"due to\".\n* **\"In spite of\"** signifies a contrasting relationship, meaning the decision would have been made *despite* the inflation surge. This is incorrect as the question clearly implies that the inflation is the reason for the decision.\n\n**Understanding the Context:**\n\nBanks raise interest rates when inflation is high to protect the value of savings. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, meaning you need more money to buy the same goods and services. By raising interest rates, banks aim to:\n\n* **Encourage saving:** Higher interest rates make saving more attractive, as people earn more on their deposits.\n* **Discourage spending:** Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, thus discouraging spending. \n\nThis helps to control inflation by reducing the amount of money in circulation.\n\n**How to Apply This Knowledge:**\n\nWhen encountering similar questions on prepositions of cause, particularly in the context of banking exams, focus on:\n\n1. **Identifying the cause and effect:** Determine which event is causing the other. \n2. **Selecting the most appropriate preposition:**  Choose the preposition that accurately reflects the causal relationship. \"Due to\" is often the most suitable option in formal writing and contexts related to finance and banking.\n\nBy understanding the nuances of these prepositions and their usage in context, you can confidently tackle similar questions in your IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Here's why:\n\n* **Understanding the Sentence:** The sentence describes a new online banking platform and emphasizes the variety of features it offers. It uses the phrase \"a plethora of features\" to convey this abundance.\n* **The Role of Prepositions:** The blank requires a preposition that introduces specific examples of the \"plethora of features.\" This is where \"Such As\" comes in.\n* **Why \"Such As\" is Correct:** \n    * **Specificity:** \"Such As\" is used to list specific examples, often without claiming to be exhaustive. This aligns with the sentence's intention to highlight some key features without necessarily naming every single one.\n    * **Clarity:** \"Such As\" creates a clear and concise link between the general statement (\"plethora of features\") and the specific examples (\"personalized financial analysis, mobile payments, and real-time transaction tracking\").\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    * **\"Namely\":** This preposition implies a more definitive list, suggesting that the following items are the only or most important features. The sentence doesn't have that connotation.\n    * **\"For Example\":** This phrase is less formal and often used in less formal contexts. The given sentence requires a more formal and precise expression.\n    * **\"Including\":** While \"including\" can introduce examples, it often implies that there are other features not listed. This contradicts the emphasis on variety and the use of \"plethora\" in the sentence.\n\n**In conclusion:** \"Such As\" is the most appropriate preposition because it accurately introduces specific examples of the \"plethora of features\" in a clear and concise manner, aligning with the overall context of the sentence.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Prepositions of Clarification:** These are words like \"namely,\" \"for example,\" \"such as,\" and \"including.\" They introduce specific examples or explanations to clarify a general statement.\n* **Importance in Banking Exams:** Understanding these prepositions is crucial for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams as they test comprehension and language skills, which are essential for effective communication in banking.\n* **Application in Other Contexts:** The same principles apply to other areas like essays, reports, and professional correspondence.

The sentence, however, describes a positive condition for getting promoted.\n* **(c) provided that:** \"Provided that\" clearly states a specific condition that needs to be met for the promotion to happen. It introduces the requirement of consistently exceeding expectations for six months.\n* **(d) because:** \"Because\" provides a reason or explanation, not a condition. It wouldn't make sense to say the promotion is happening *because* of meeting the requirements; it's happening *if* the requirements are met.\n\n**Why \"Provided That\" is the Best Choice:**\n\n\"Provided that\" is the most suitable choice because it accurately conveys the conditional nature of the promotion. It emphasizes that the promotion is *provided* or given *on the condition* that the employee consistently exceeds expectations. \n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of **prepositions of condition**, a crucial concept for English language proficiency in banking exams. Knowing the nuances of \"if,\" \"unless,\" and \"provided that\" helps you interpret and formulate complex sentences, which is essential for comprehending and responding to questions in English language sections of competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Prepositions of condition:** These words introduce a condition that must be met for something to happen. Common examples include \"if,\" \"unless,\" \"provided that,\" \"on condition that,\" and \"in case.\"\n* **Conditional sentences:** These sentences express a relationship between two events, where one event depends on the other. They typically follow a structure like: **If (condition), then (result).**\n\n**Applying the Knowledge:**\n\nTo answer similar questions, try to identify the specific condition or requirement mentioned in the sentence. Then, choose the preposition that best conveys this condition.  Pay attention to the context of the sentence and the meaning you want to express.\n",

Here's why:\n\n* **Understanding Prepositions of Concession:** Prepositions of concession introduce a contrasting idea, showing that something happened even though there was an obstacle or opposing factor. The most common prepositions of concession are:\n    * **Although:** Introduces a clause (a group of words with a subject and verb)\n    * **Even though:** Similar to \"although\", introduces a clause.\n    * **Despite:** Followed by a noun phrase (a group of words that acts like a noun)\n    * **In spite of:**  Similar to \"despite\", followed by a noun phrase.\n\n* **Analyzing the Sentence:**  The sentence structure requires a preposition followed by a noun phrase. The noun phrase here is \"the warnings from the authorities\".\n\n* **Eliminating Incorrect Options:**\n    * **A) Although** and **B) Even though** are incorrect because they introduce clauses, not noun phrases. The sentence needs a preposition that can directly connect to the noun phrase \"the warnings from the authorities\".\n    * **D) In spite of** is grammatically correct, but \"Despite\" is more commonly used in this context.\n\n* **Choosing the Best Option:** \n    * **C) Despite** is the most suitable option because it is a preposition followed by a noun phrase, creating a grammatically correct and natural-sounding sentence: \"Despite the warnings from the authorities, many people still chose to go to the beach during the storm.\"\n\n**Key Takeaway for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nMastering prepositions of concession is crucial for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Understanding the difference between \"although/even though\" and \"despite/in spite of\" is essential for choosing the correct answer in sentence completion questions. \n\n**Additional Tips for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Look for the grammatical structure:** Analyze the sentence to identify if it requires a preposition followed by a clause or a noun phrase.\n* **Context Matters:**  Consider the context of the sentence to determine the most appropriate preposition.

In this case, the archaeologist was convinced of the Mayan calendar's accuracy **by** witnessing its alignment with celestial bodies **through** complex calculations. \n\nLet's analyze why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **\"With\"** suggests an accompaniment or tool used. It doesn't fit the context as the calculations themselves are the means of achieving the alignment, not a tool. \n* **\"In\"** indicates a state or location. It doesn't apply here as we are not talking about the alignment being *in* something but rather achieved *through* something.\n* **\"Through\"** describes a process or passage. While it's partially correct in this case, it's not the primary preposition needed. The alignment was achieved **by** the calculations, **through** which the archaeologist witnessed the accuracy. \n\n**Why this knowledge is crucial for IBPS PO, SBI PO exams:**\n\nThese exams heavily test your understanding of English grammar, including prepositions. Choosing the correct preposition can significantly impact the meaning of a sentence, and this is something these exams frequently test. Understanding the subtle nuances of prepositions like \"by,\" \"with,\" \"in,\" and \"through\" is essential for building a strong command of English grammar and scoring well in the exams.\n\n**Additional context:**\n\nThis question focuses on \"Prepositions of Manner,\" specifically the use of \"by\". It's crucial to understand that prepositions often depend on the context of the sentence.  \"By\" is usually used to indicate the means, agent, or instrument used to perform an action.  \n\nTo improve your understanding of prepositions, consider the following:\n\n* **Practice with various types of sentences:**  Try to identify the preposition used and the context it provides.\n* **Memorize common preposition combinations:**  Learning phrases like \"by means of,\" \"by way of,\" and \"with the help of\" will help you recognize their usage patterns.\n* **Use online resources and grammar books:**  Explore resources like the Oxford Learner's Dictionary and Grammarly for in-depth explanations and examples of prepositions. \n\nBy mastering prepositions, you'll not only answer questions correctly but also improve your overall English writing and communication skills. \n",

The crucial part is \"**the end of the business day**.\" This phrase signifies a specific deadline or endpoint.\n\n**Preposition Breakdown:**\n\n* **a) before:** This implies the processing will be completed *before* the end of the business day, which contradicts the sentence's meaning. It suggests an earlier completion than what's stated.\n* **b) during:**  This indicates the processing will happen *within* the business day, not necessarily finishing by the end. The sentence emphasizes completion, not just occurrence.\n* **c) until:**  This implies the processing will continue *until* the end of the business day, potentially continuing beyond. The sentence highlights the processing ending at the deadline, not continuing past it.\n* **d) by:** This accurately signifies a deadline. The phrase \"by the end of the business day\" means all loan applications will be processed *no later than* the end of the day. \n\n**Why \"by\" is the best choice:**\n\n\"By\" is the most appropriate preposition because it sets a clear endpoint for the processing task. It indicates that the bank's system will ensure all applications are handled by the stated deadline.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to IBPS PO and SBI PO exams because it tests your understanding of prepositions, specifically those related to time and deadlines. These are crucial concepts in banking as they often relate to loan processing times, account opening procedures, and other crucial deadlines.\n\n**Key takeaway:**\n\nUnderstanding prepositions like \"by,\" \"before,\" \"during,\" and \"until\" is essential for accurately comprehending and constructing sentences related to deadlines and timeframes. \n",

It describes a bustling marketplace full of energy and activity, then focuses on a single person who is completely detached from that energy. \n* **The Meaning of \"Except\":**  \"Except\" means \"excluding\" or \"not including.\" It specifically designates something as an exception to a general rule or statement. \n* **Why \"Except\" Fits:** In this case, the solitary figure is the exception to the general rule of the bustling marketplace.  \"Except\" perfectly captures this contrast, emphasizing that the figure is not part of the lively scene.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **b) Besides:** \"Besides\" means \"in addition to\" or \"apart from.\" It implies that the solitary figure is a part of the general scene, not an exception.\n* **c) But:** \"But\" indicates a contrast, but it doesn't necessarily imply an exclusion. It can be used to connect two ideas, but not necessarily highlight an exception.\n* **d) And:** \"And\" simply adds information. It doesn't create the contrast needed to portray the solitary figure as a distinct outlier.\n\n**Understanding Prepositions of Exception:**\n\nPrepositions of exception are words that indicate that something is not included in a general statement.  They help us understand that there is a specific difference or contrast.  Common prepositions of exception include:\n\n* **Except:**  Indicates exclusion.\n* **Besides:**  Indicates something in addition to what is already mentioned.\n* **But:**  Indicates a contrast or exception.\n* **Save:**  Indicates exclusion, usually used in legal or formal writing.\n\n**Applying this Knowledge to Banking Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding prepositions of exception is crucial for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, as they test your vocabulary and grammar skills.  These types of questions often appear in the English Language section, focusing on:\n\n* **Sentence Completion:** Filling in blanks with appropriate words that make the sentence grammatically correct and logically sound.\n* **Error Spotting:** Identifying grammatical errors within a sentence.\n* **Reading Comprehension:** Analyzing the meaning of sentences and paragraphs to answer questions about the passage.\n\nBy understanding prepositions of exception, you can improve your accuracy and speed in answering these questions, ultimately increasing your chances of success in banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **\"Nevertheless\"** and here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Sentence Structure:**\n\nThe sentence presents a contrast between two ideas:\n\n* **Initial Hope:** The mirage offers the promise of relief and water in the harsh desert.\n* **Harsh Reality:** The mirage is ultimately a deceptive illusion, offering no real respite.\n\n**Role of Conjunctive Adverbs:**\n\nConjunctive adverbs like \"but\", \"however\", and \"nevertheless\" are used to connect two contrasting ideas. They act like bridges, highlighting the shift in thought and emphasizing the contrast.\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n* **\"But\"** is too abrupt and lacks the nuanced emphasis on the mirage's persistent deception. It focuses solely on the contrasting idea, not the ongoing nature of the illusion.\n* **\"However\"**, while conveying contrast, is less impactful than \"nevertheless\". It emphasizes the contrast but doesn't highlight the mirage's continued presence despite its deceptive nature.\n* **\"Although\"** introduces a reason for the following statement. It suggests that the mirage is real but deceptive *because* of the sun's trickery. This doesn't align with the context, which emphasizes the mirage's constant deceptive nature, even though it's unreal.\n* **\"Nevertheless\"** effectively emphasizes the contrast while highlighting the persistence of the mirage. It conveys that despite being an illusion, the mirage continues to exist, deceptively promising hope in the harsh reality.\n\n**Key Takeaway for Banking Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding the nuances of conjunctive adverbs like \"nevertheless\", \"however\", and \"but\" is crucial for banking exams. These words are often used to test your understanding of sentence structure, logical flow, and the ability to choose the most impactful word for conveying contrast.\n\n**Applying the Knowledge:**\n\nIn similar questions, look for contrasting ideas within the sentence. Consider the impact of each conjunctive adverb:\n\n* **\"But\"**: A simple contrast, often used for abrupt shifts.\n* **\"However\"**:  A stronger contrast, introducing a counter-argument.\n* **\"Nevertheless\"**: Emphasis on the contrast, highlighting persistence despite the opposing idea.\n* **\"Although\"**: Introduces a reason for the contrasting idea. \n\nBy analyzing the context and the impact of each adverb, you can confidently choose the most appropriate option to create a grammatically correct and impactful sentence.\n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Sentence Structure:**\n\nThe sentence establishes a general concept: the rise of specialized e-commerce platforms. It then introduces specific examples of these platforms. The word that connects the general idea to the specific examples is crucial. \n\n**Why \"such as\" is the best choice:**\n\n* **Specificity:** \"Such as\" is used to introduce specific examples that fall under a broader category. The sentence is focused on giving specific examples of specialized e-commerce platforms (sustainable products, vintage clothing, artisanal crafts). \n* **Clear Distinction:** It clearly distinguishes the general category (e-commerce platforms specializing in specific categories) from the examples given.\n* **Formal Tone:** The sentence uses formal language, and \"such as\" is a more formal and appropriate choice compared to \"like\" or \"for instance\".\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **a) for instance:** \"For instance\" is used to introduce a single example or a few, but the sentence focuses on a list of examples, making it less suitable.\n* **b) like:** \"Like\" is typically used for comparisons, suggesting similarity between two things. The sentence isn't comparing different types of platforms; it's listing examples.\n* **d) including:** \"Including\" implies a more exhaustive list of examples. The sentence doesn't suggest that these are all the possible specialized e-commerce platforms, making \"including\" inappropriate.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\n* **\"Such as\" is the most suitable preposition when introducing specific examples that fall under a broader category.**\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThese banking exams often test grammar and vocabulary, including the use of prepositions. Understanding the subtle differences between prepositions like \"for instance\", \"such as\", \"like\", and \"including\" is crucial for answering such questions accurately. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThe question deals with the evolving landscape of e-commerce.

They act like signposts, telling the reader, \"Here are some specific instances of what I just mentioned.\"\n\n**The Key Players:**\n\n* **\"Such as\"** is the most common and versatile preposition of example. It works well with both singular and plural examples, and it can be used to introduce a list of any length.\n* **\"For instance\"** is typically used to introduce a single, specific example. It's less common for introducing a list.\n* **\"Like\"** is primarily used for comparisons, suggesting similarity. It's not ideal for introducing a list of examples.\n* **\"Regarding\"** is used to introduce a topic of discussion, not a list of examples.\n\n**Analyzing the Sentence:**\n\nThe sentence discusses the surge in online banking adoption and lists three factors driving this trend: smartphone penetration, internet connectivity, and digital transaction preference. \n\n* **\"Such as\"** fits perfectly because it introduces a list of three examples that contribute to the broader trend.\n* The other options are not suitable:\n    * **\"For instance\"** would be incorrect because it's used for single examples, not lists.\n    * **\"Like\"** implies a comparison, which is not the intended meaning here.\n    * **\"Regarding\"** would shift the focus to discussing the factors themselves, not their role as examples.\n\n**Why This Matters for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThese exams often test your understanding of English grammar, including prepositions. Being able to choose the correct preposition of example demonstrates your grasp of language nuances, which is crucial for interpreting and expressing information accurately. \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* \"Such as\" is the best choice for introducing a list of examples.\n* Remember the distinctions between prepositions of example and other prepositions to avoid common errors.\n* Practice identifying and using appropriate prepositions in different contexts. \n\nBy understanding these concepts, you can improve your English proficiency and score well in your banking exams. \n",
