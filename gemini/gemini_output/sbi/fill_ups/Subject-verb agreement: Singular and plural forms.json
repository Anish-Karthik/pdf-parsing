            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **\"B\"** because the sentence requires a plural verb to match the plural subject \"mice\".\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Subject-Verb Agreement:**  The basic rule of grammar is that the verb in a sentence must agree in number with its subject. This means if the subject is singular, the verb must be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural.\n2. **Identifying the Subject:**  The subject of the sentence is \"mice\", which is a plural noun.\n3. **Choosing the Correct Verb:** The verb in the sentence is \"run\" which has two forms: \"run\" (plural) and \"runs\" (singular). Since the subject \"mice\" is plural, the correct verb is \"run\".\n\n**Therefore, the correct sentence is \"The mice run across the kitchen floor.\"**\n\n**Why this is important for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Grammar is a crucial part of the English language section:**  These exams test your proficiency in English grammar, which includes subject-verb agreement.  \n* **Understanding Subject-Verb Agreement:**  This concept ensures your sentences are grammatically correct and easy to understand. \n* **Improving Your Language Skills:** A strong grasp of grammar helps you communicate effectively in written and spoken English, which is essential in various banking roles.\n\n**Here are some additional tips for remembering subject-verb agreement:**\n\n* **Identify the subject first:**  Always find the subject of the sentence before determining the correct verb.\n* **Be aware of tricky subjects:** Words like \"everyone\", \"someone\", and \"anyone\" are singular even though they sound plural.\n* **Watch out for collective nouns:** Nouns like \"team\", \"family\", and \"committee\" can be singular or plural depending on the context.\n\nBy understanding subject-verb agreement, you can confidently tackle grammar-related questions in your competitive exams and enhance your overall communication skills. \n",

Here's why:\n\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The fundamental rule of grammar is that the verb in a sentence must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural). \n* **\"You\" is Always Plural:**  Even when addressing a single person, the pronoun \"you\" is always considered plural. This is a quirk of English grammar that stems from its historical development. \n* **\"Are\" is the Plural Form:**  The verb \"are\" is the plural form of the verb \"to be\". Since \"you\" is plural, the plural verb \"are\" is required.\n\n**In simple terms:**  The sentence is saying \"You (plural) are always welcome...\"  \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This question tests your understanding of a key grammatical concept that appears frequently in the English language. \n* Recognizing the special case of \"you\" being considered plural, despite potentially referring to a single person, is crucial for accurate grammar and effective communication.\n* While the specific topic of \"Subject-Verb Agreement with 'You'\" may not be a dedicated section in the IBPS PO or SBI PO exams, understanding this concept is fundamental to answering various English language questions, particularly those related to grammar and vocabulary.\n\n**To Apply This Knowledge:**\n\n1. **Practice:**  Practice identifying the subject and verb in sentences and ensuring they agree in number.\n2. **Remember \"You\":**  Always treat the pronoun \"you\" as plural, even when addressing a single person.\n3. **Review:**  Refer to grammar resources or online guides for further clarification on subject-verb agreement rules. \n\nBy understanding and applying this concept, you'll be well-prepared to tackle a range of English grammar questions in your banking exam preparation. \n",

It's like saying \"these cookies\" or \"these delicious treats.\" \n3. **Plural Verb \"are\":** Since the subject is plural, the verb must also be plural. The correct plural form of the verb \"to be\" in the present tense is \"are.\"  \n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **\"is\" and \"was\" are singular verbs.** They would be used if the subject was singular, like \"This cookie is baked fresh.\" \n* **\"were\" is the past tense of \"are\".**  The sentence refers to the present tense, not the past, so \"were\" is incorrect. \n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\nUnderstanding subject-verb agreement is crucial for accurate English writing and speaking. This concept is frequently tested in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. You can apply this knowledge to solve similar questions by:\n\n1. **Identifying the subject:** Find the noun or pronoun that performs the action.\n2. **Determining its number:** Is it singular (one) or plural (more than one)? \n3. **Choosing the correct verb form:** Make sure the verb agrees with the subject in number.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **\"Those\" works the same way as \"these\"**:  Both are plural pronouns and require a plural verb. For example, \"Those cookies are delicious.\"\n* **Be careful with Collective Nouns:**  Collective nouns (like \"team,\" \"family,\" or \"committee\") can be singular or plural depending on whether they act as a single unit or individual members.\n* **Practice, practice, practice:** The best way to master subject-verb agreement is through consistent practice with different types of sentences and verb tenses.\n\nBy applying these principles, you can confidently tackle subject-verb agreement questions in your exams and improve your overall English skills. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Subject-Verb Agreement**\n\nSubject-verb agreement is a fundamental grammatical rule that dictates that a verb must agree in number (singular or plural) with its subject. This means if the subject is singular, the verb must be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural. \n\n**Analyzing the Sentence:**\n\n* **Subject:** The subject of the sentence is \"team\", which is a plural noun. \n* **Prepositional Phrase:** The phrase \"along with their coach\" is a prepositional phrase. It modifies the subject but doesn't change its plurality. Think of it as additional information about the team, not a separate subject.\n* **Verb:** The verb needs to agree with the subject \"team\". Since \"team\" is plural, the verb should also be plural.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **\"is\" (Option A):** \"Is\" is a singular verb and does not agree with the plural subject \"team\".\n* **\"are\" (Option B):** While \"are\" is plural, it's used for the present tense, not the past tense as implied in the sentence.\n* **\"was\" (Option C):** \"Was\" is a singular verb in the past tense, but it doesn't match the plural subject \"team\".\n\n**Applying This Knowledge to Other Sentences**\n\nThis concept applies to many other sentences where there might be phrases or clauses inserted between the subject and the verb. Here's a general rule of thumb:\n\n* **Focus on the Main Subject:** Identify the main subject of the sentence. Ignore any prepositional phrases or clauses that might come between the subject and verb.\n* **Check for Plurality:** Determine whether the subject is singular or plural.\n* **Match the Verb:** Choose the verb that agrees in number with the subject. \n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nSubject-verb agreement questions are common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. They test your understanding of fundamental English grammar, which is crucial for effective communication and understanding in any professional setting. By mastering this concept, you can confidently tackle such questions and improve your overall score in these competitive exams. \n",

This means that if the subject is singular, the verb must be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural. \n* **Plural Subject:** The subject of the sentence is \"cats,\" which is a plural noun.  \n* **Plural Verb:** The verb \"are\" is the plural form of the verb \"to be\" and is the correct form to use with the plural subject \"cats.\"\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **\"is\" and \"was\"** are singular verbs.  They would be correct if the subject were \"cat\" (singular), but not with \"cats.\"\n* **\"were\"** is the past tense of \"are.\" While it is a plural verb, it doesn't fit the present tense context of the sentence. The sentence describes an action happening now, not in the past. \n\n**Key takeaways for subject-verb agreement with 'more than one':**\n\n* **Identify the subject:** Find the noun or pronoun that performs the action in the sentence.\n* **Determine if the subject is singular or plural:**  \n    * Singular subjects (e.g., cat, dog, book) require singular verbs.\n    * Plural subjects (e.g., cats, dogs, books) require plural verbs.\n* **Choose the correct verb form:** Ensure the verb agrees in number with the subject.\n\n**This concept is crucial for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams because it tests your grammatical accuracy and ability to identify and correct errors in written English.**  Understanding subject-verb agreement helps you write clear and grammatically correct sentences, which is essential for professional communication and for scoring well on these exams. \n",

In this case, \"some\" refers to \"books\", making it plural. \n* **Focus on the subject:** Always identify the subject of the sentence before choosing the correct verb. The subject is the noun or pronoun that performs the action.\n* **Tricky phrases:** Be aware of phrases that can make subject-verb agreement tricky, like \"some of\", \"all of\", \"most of\", etc. These phrases often contain a plural noun, even if they refer to a part of a whole.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\nThese exams often test grammatical concepts like subject-verb agreement.

While it's grammatically correct, the sentence focuses on a general truth about research on climate change, not a specific ongoing action.\n    * **(d) are providing:** This is the plural form of the verb and doesn't agree with the singular subject \"research.\"\n\n**In conclusion:**  \"provides\" is the correct verb form because it agrees with the singular uncountable noun \"research\". The other options are incorrect as they use plural verb forms or incorrect tenses. \n\n**Key Takeaway for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding subject-verb agreement, especially with uncountable nouns, is crucial for grammar-based questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Familiarize yourself with common uncountable nouns and practice applying the singular verb forms with them. \n",

It's not acting as a singular unit but rather highlighting the individual actions of the students within the group.\n* **When a collective noun refers to individual members of a group, it takes a plural verb.**\n* Therefore, the correct verb to use is \"have\" (plural), which agrees with the plural subject \"students\".\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n\n* A common mistake is using a singular verb (\"has\") with a collective noun that refers to individuals. This happens when people mistakenly think of the collective noun as a singular entity.\n\n**Key takeaway:** When encountering a collective noun, always analyze whether it represents a single unit or a group of individuals to determine the correct verb agreement. \n",

It can be singular or plural depending on the context. In this case, \"none\" refers to the plural noun \"witnesses\". \n* **Contextual Clue:** The phrase \"None of the witnesses\" clearly indicates that we are talking about multiple witnesses.

Here's why:\n\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:**  The fundamental principle of subject-verb agreement states that the verb in a sentence must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural). \n* **The Subject:** The subject of the sentence is \"Those intricate carvings\".  The word \"those\" is a plural pronoun, indicating that there are multiple carvings.\n* **The Verb:** The verb \"be\" needs to agree with the plural subject. The correct plural form of \"be\" in the present tense is \"are\".\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(a) is:**  \"Is\" is the singular form of \"be\", which does not agree with the plural subject.\n* **(c) was:**  \"Was\" is the past tense singular form of \"be\",  and it doesn't match the present tense context of the sentence.\n* **(d) were:**  While \"were\" is the plural form of \"be\", it is in the past tense, and the sentence is in the present tense.\n\n**Applying this knowledge to similar questions:**\n\nThe key takeaway from this question is to identify the subject of the sentence and determine its number (singular or plural).

This is because it emphasizes the collective group rather than individual executives. \n* **Singular verb:**  Since the subject is singular (\"more than one\"), the verb must also be singular. In this case, the singular verb is \"has\".\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **\"have\":** This is the plural form of the verb \"to have\" and would be incorrect because the subject is singular.\n* **\"are\":** This is the plural form of the verb \"to be\" and is incorrect for the same reason as \"have\".\n* **\"is\":** While \"is\" is singular, it doesn't fit the grammatical context of the sentence. \"Is\" is used for a singular subject in the present tense, but the sentence requires the present perfect tense (has been invited).\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\nThis type of subject-verb agreement question is common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  Understanding how \"more than one\" functions as a singular subject is crucial for these exams.  Here are some additional points to remember:\n\n* **\"More than one\" vs. \"More than one...\" + plural noun:** While \"more than one\" is singular, if it's followed by a plural noun, the verb will agree with the plural noun. For example: \"More than one **student** **have** applied for the scholarship.\" (Here, \"students\" is plural, so the verb \"have\" is used.)\n* **Other phrases like \"more than one\"**: There are similar phrases like \"a number of\", \"a lot of\", \"a great many\" that also act as singular subjects when used before a plural noun.\n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\nBy mastering subject-verb agreement, especially in cases involving phrases like \"more than one\", you can confidently tackle these questions in your IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Here's why:\n\n* **Understanding the Sentence Structure:** The sentence contains a relative clause, which is a clause that modifies a noun. In this case, the relative clause is \"____ were planning a surprise party for their teacher.\" This clause describes the group of students.\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:**  The key to choosing the right pronoun lies in understanding subject-verb agreement. The relative pronoun must agree with the noun it refers to in terms of number (singular or plural). \n* **'Which' vs. 'Who'**:  \n    * 'Which' is used to refer to things or groups of people. \n    * 'Who' is used to refer to people.\n* **The Sentence Analysis:**\n    * The noun \"group\" is plural.\n    * The verb \"were planning\" is also plural, indicating that the subject of the relative clause is plural.\n    * Therefore, the correct relative pronoun is \"which,\" which agrees with the plural subject \"group.\"\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    * **(b) who:** 'Who' is used for people, not groups of people.\n    * **(c) that:** While 'that' can be used for both people and things, it's generally considered more formal. 'Which' is more appropriate in this context. \n    * **(d) whom:**  'Whom' is the objective case of 'who' and is used when the pronoun is the object of a verb or preposition. In this sentence, the pronoun is the subject of the verb 'were planning.'\n\n**In Summary:**  The correct answer is \"which\" because it agrees in number with the plural noun \"group\" and correctly acts as the subject of the relative clause. \n\n**For IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding subject-verb agreement with relative pronouns is crucial for these exams. Practice similar questions focusing on the distinction between \"which\" and \"who\" and their usage in different sentence structures. \n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Identify the Noun:**  Always determine the noun the relative clause modifies.\n* **Check the Verb:** Ensure the verb in the relative clause agrees in number with the noun.\n* **Choose the Correct Pronoun:** Select the appropriate relative pronoun based on the noun's nature and the context. \n",

It refers to the general idea of \"the early bird catches the worm\". \n2. **The verb is \"is\"**:  The verb \"is\" is the singular present tense form of the verb \"to be\". It agrees with the singular subject \"It\". \n3. **The phrase \"often said\" is a modifier**:  The phrase \"often said\" acts as a modifier describing the statement \"the early bird catches the worm\".

This rule applies even when using relative pronouns like 'who' and 'whoever'.\n\n**Analyzing the Sentence**\n\nThe sentence is: \"The candidate ____ chosen for the interview was the most qualified applicant.\"\n\n* **Subject:** The subject of the sentence is \"candidate\", which is singular. \n* **Relative Clause:**  The phrase \"____ chosen for the interview\" is a relative clause that modifies the noun \"candidate\". \n* **Relative Pronoun:**  The relative pronoun 'who' acts as the subject of the relative clause. Since 'who' refers back to \"candidate\" (a singular noun), the verb in the relative clause must also be singular.\n\n**Why \"who was\" is Correct**\n\n* **\"who was\"** correctly uses the singular verb \"was\" to agree with the singular subject \"who\" (referring to the singular \"candidate\").\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **\"who were\"** uses the plural verb \"were\" incorrectly. It doesn't agree with the singular subject \"who\".\n* **\"whom was\"** uses the incorrect pronoun \"whom\". \"Whom\" is the objective case pronoun and should be used as the object of a verb or preposition. Here, \"who\" is the subject of the relative clause and thus should be used in the nominative case.\n* **\"whom were\"** is incorrect for both reasons mentioned above - it uses the wrong pronoun and the wrong verb form.\n\n**Key Takeaway**\n\nWhen using 'who' or 'whoever' in a relative clause, the verb must agree with the antecedent of the pronoun (the noun it refers to). If the antecedent is singular, use a singular verb. If the antecedent is plural, use a plural verb.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* **Singular:** The student **who was** chosen for the scholarship is from Delhi. (The antecedent of 'who' is 'student', which is singular.)\n* **Plural:** The students **who were** chosen for the scholarship are from different states. (The antecedent of 'who' is 'students', which is plural.)\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams**\n\nThese exams often test grammar and vocabulary, including subject-verb agreement.

Here's why:\n\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The fundamental rule of grammar is that the verb in a sentence must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural).\n* **Subject: \"A great deal of investment\"** This is a singular noun phrase. Although \"investment\" is plural, the phrase \"a great deal of\" acts as a quantifier making the subject singular.\n* **Verb: \"is\"**  This is the correct singular present tense verb that agrees with the singular subject \"a great deal of investment\".\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **b) are:** This is the plural form of the verb \"to be\", which doesn't agree with the singular subject.\n* **c) has:** This is the third-person singular present tense of \"to have\", but it doesn't fit the context of the sentence. The sentence focuses on a continuous action, not a completed one.\n* **d) have:** This is the plural form of \"to have\", and it doesn't agree with the singular subject.\n\n**Important Note:** The words \"much\" and \"little\" often act as quantifiers, similar to \"a great deal of\". When used with singular nouns, they require singular verbs. \n\n**Example:** \n\n* *Much* effort **has** been put into this project.\n* *Little* time **is** left to complete the task.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Banking Exams:**\n\nSubject-Verb Agreement is a crucial grammar concept tested in various sections of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, particularly in English Language. These exams often feature reading comprehension passages and sentence correction questions that test your understanding of subject-verb agreement and other grammatical rules.

This means they always refer to one individual item or person, even when followed by a plural noun. \n\n**Analyzing the Sentence**\n\nIn this sentence:\n\n* **Subject:** The subject is \"Every one\", which is singular.  Even though \"numerous applicants\" comes after, the focus is on each individual applicant. \n* **Verb:**  The verb is \"is\".  \n* **Agreement:** The verb \"is\" agrees with the singular subject \"Every one.\"\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect**\n\n* **(b) are:** This is the plural form of the verb, which does not agree with the singular subject \"Every one.\"\n* **(c) was:**  This is the past tense of the verb \"to be.\" While the sentence mentions a past action (\"submitted\"), the focus is on the present state of being (\"eagerly awaiting\"). The present tense is more appropriate. \n* **(d) were:** This is the plural form of the verb in the past tense, which does not agree with the singular subject \"Every one.\"\n\n**Key Takeaway**\n\nWhen you see \"every\" or \"each\" followed by a plural noun, remember that these words create a singular subject. The verb must agree with this singular subject. \n",

It's a pronoun that represents the unknown thing being discussed. The phrase \"besides the sheer volume of data collected\" modifies \"What\" and provides further context.  \n\n**Subject-Verb Agreement Rules:**\n\nThe fundamental rule of subject-verb agreement is that **singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs.**\n\n* **Singular verb:** \"is\", \"was\", \"has\", \"does\"\n* **Plural verb:** \"are\", \"were\", \"have\", \"do\"\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n* **a) is:**  This is a singular verb, and it correctly agrees with the singular subject \"What.\"\n* **b) are:** This is a plural verb, and it doesn't agree with the singular subject \"What.\"\n* **c) have:** This is a plural verb and incorrect tense for the sentence. \n* **d) has:** This is a singular verb but incorrect tense for the sentence. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that correctly agrees with the singular subject \"What\" is **a) is**. This is the correct answer because it maintains the singular-singular agreement necessary for grammatically sound sentence structure.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nWhen dealing with \"What\" as a subject, remember that it usually acts as a singular noun.  Therefore, the verb must also be singular to maintain subject-verb agreement.  \n\n**Applying this knowledge to similar questions:**\n\nThis concept is fundamental in grammar and is tested in various ways in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Understanding how subject-verb agreement works with \"What\" will help you answer similar questions correctly and confidently. \n",

The subject of this sentence is \"group of students,\" which is a plural noun.\n\n2. **Identifying the Subject:**  It's crucial to correctly identify the subject of the sentence. The phrase \"who are all aspiring bankers\" is a relative clause modifying \"group of students\" and doesn't affect the main subject-verb agreement.\n\n3. **Plural Verb:** Since the subject is plural, we need a plural verb.  The verb \"are studying\" is the correct plural form of the present tense verb \"to study.\"\n\n4. **Eliminating Incorrect Options:**\n    * **\"is studying\"** is incorrect because it's a singular verb, not matching the plural subject.\n    * **\"was studying\"** and **\"were studying\"** are both in the past tense. The context of the sentence suggests a present action, indicating that the students are currently studying for the exam.\n\n**Key Takeaway for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nSubject-verb agreement is a fundamental grammar concept frequently tested in these exams.  Focus on:\n\n* **Identifying the subject:** Be careful with phrases like \"along with,\" \"as well as,\" or relative clauses that might confuse the subject.\n* **Matching singular and plural:** Ensure the verb form correctly aligns with the number of the subject (singular or plural).\n\n**Example:**\n\n* **Incorrect:** The group of students *is* working hard for the exam.\n* **Correct:** The group of students *are* working hard for the exam.\n\n**Practice Tip:**\n\nPractice subject-verb agreement questions regularly.

While the word itself is singular, the action of the group is often considered plural. \n\n**Subject-Verb Agreement:**\n\nThe verb in a sentence must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural).\n\n* **Singular subject:** takes a singular verb. \n* **Plural subject:** takes a plural verb.\n\n**Applying it to the Sentence:**\n\nIn this case, although \"committee\" is a singular noun, it represents the actions of multiple individuals (the committee members).

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Subject-Verb Agreement:**\n\nSubject-verb agreement is a fundamental grammatical rule in English. It states that the verb in a sentence must agree in number (singular or plural) with its subject.  \n\n* **Singular Subject:** Takes a singular verb.\n* **Plural Subject:** Takes a plural verb.\n\n**Uncountable Nouns:**\n\nUncountable nouns refer to things that cannot be counted individually. They are treated as singular and require a singular verb. Examples include:\n\n* Information\n* Advice\n* Water\n* Furniture\n* Money\n\n**Analyzing the Sentence:**\n\n1. **Subject:** The subject of the sentence is \"discussions,\" which is an uncountable noun. It refers to a general concept, not a specific number of discussions.\n2. **Verb:** The verb in the sentence needs to agree with the subject. \n3. **Present Tense:** The sentence uses the phrase \"ongoing discussions\" which indicates an action happening currently, so we need a present tense verb.\n\n**Why Option (a) is Correct:**\n\nOption (a) \"provides\" is the singular present tense form of the verb \"to provide\". It correctly agrees with the singular uncountable noun \"discussions.\" \n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **(b) provide:** This is the plural present tense form of the verb, which is incorrect because \"discussions\" is singular.\n* **(c) has provided:** This is the singular past perfect tense form of the verb, which doesn't fit the present tense context of the sentence.\n* **(d) have provided:** This is the plural past perfect tense form of the verb, also incorrect because it doesn't match the singular subject and the present tense context.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nTo ensure subject-verb agreement, identify the subject of the sentence, determine whether it's singular or plural, and choose the corresponding verb form. Pay special attention to uncountable nouns, as they are always treated as singular. \n",

Subject-Verb Agreement:**\n\n* **\"Not only the meticulous research and development efforts undertaken by the team _[blank]_ crucial to the project's success...\"**  Here, the subject is \"efforts\" which is plural. Therefore, the verb needs to be plural as well. So, \"are\" is the correct choice.\n\n* **\"...but also the unwavering commitment of the stakeholders, who _[blank]_ consistently provided their support...\"** The subject here is \"commitment\" which is singular.  The verb needs to be singular, hence \"has\" is the correct choice.\n\n* **\"... _[blank]_ instrumental in achieving the desired outcome.\"** The subject here is \"support\" which is singular.  The verb needs to be singular, hence \"is\" is the correct choice.\n\n**2. Parallel Structure:**\n\nThe sentence uses the \"not only... but also\" construction, which emphasizes parallelism. This means that the grammatical structure following both \"not only\" and \"but also\" should be similar. \n\n* The first part uses \"efforts are crucial...\"\n* The second part uses \"commitment has... support is...\"\n\nThis structure maintains parallelism, creating a grammatically sound and balanced sentence.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is option B because it correctly aligns the verbs with their corresponding subjects and maintains the parallel structure of the sentence. This is crucial for clear and effective communication, particularly in formal writing and exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:** This topic is fundamental in English grammar. It ensures that the verb in a sentence agrees with the subject in terms of number (singular/plural).\n* **Parallel Structure:**  This principle makes writing clearer and more impactful by using similar grammatical structures for similar ideas. It is especially important in complex sentences like the one in this question.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts will help you tackle similar questions during your preparation for banking exams.

Therefore, the verb must also be in the plural form, which is \"continue\".\n\nLet's break down why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **a) continues:** This is the singular form of the verb, which does not agree with the plural subject \"many of these enterprises.\" \n* **c) has continued:** This is the singular form of the verb in the present perfect tense, which is incorrect because the sentence refers to an ongoing action, not a completed one. \n* **d) are continuing:**  While grammatically correct in terms of subject-verb agreement, this option doesn't fit the context of the sentence. The sentence is describing a general trend rather than a specific, ongoing action.\n\n**Key Concept: Subject-Verb Agreement**\n\nSubject-verb agreement is a fundamental grammatical rule that dictates that the verb in a sentence must agree with its subject in number. This means that if the subject is singular, the verb must be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural. \n\n**Common Phrases with Plural Subjects**\n\nWords like \"many\", \"few\", \"several\", \"some\", and \"a number of\" are often used to introduce plural subjects.  Remember to ensure your verb agrees with the plural subject.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams**\n\nSubject-verb agreement questions are a common feature of English language sections in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  These exams test your ability to understand and apply basic grammatical rules.  Mastering subject-verb agreement will help you improve your overall grammar skills and perform well on these exams. \n\n**Tips for Subject-Verb Agreement**\n\n* **Identify the subject:**  Always begin by identifying the subject of the sentence.\n* **Determine the subject's number:** Is the subject singular or plural?\n* **Choose the correct verb form:** Make sure the verb agrees with the subject in number.\n* **Pay attention to tricky words:** Words like \"many\", \"few\", and \"a number of\" often introduce plural subjects.\n\nBy understanding and applying these concepts, you can confidently tackle subject-verb agreement questions in your banking exams. \n",

It refers to \"not a single person.\" \n    * **Everyone, anyone, and someone** are all singular indefinite pronouns.\n\n* **Analyzing the options:**\n    * **A) Everyone:**  \"Everyone\" would imply that *all* employees are confident, which contradicts the sentence's negative tone.\n    * **B) Anyone:** \"Anyone\" would imply that *at least one* employee is confident, again not reflecting the overall sense of uncertainty. \n    * **C) Someone:** \"Someone\" would indicate that *a few* employees are confident, also contradicting the implied sense of uncertainty.\n    * **D) No one:** \"No one\" is the only option that correctly reflects the negative tone of the sentence. \"No one\" is singular and agrees with the plural verb \"are\".

It provides additional information about the network but doesn't change the subject's singularity.\n3. **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The verb must agree with the subject in number.

This choice demonstrates the crucial principle of subject-verb agreement, a fundamental concept tested in various competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Subject:**\n\nThe subject of the sentence is \"**analysis**\".  While \"data\" might seem like the subject due to its prominent position, it's actually the object of the preposition \"of\".  The sentence focuses on the action of the analysis itself, not the data being analyzed.\n\n**Nouns Ending in '-ics':**\n\nWords ending in '-ics', like \"analysis,\" \"physics,\" \"politics,\" etc., often cause confusion in subject-verb agreement. Although these words sound plural, they are generally considered singular nouns. This is because they represent a single, unified concept or field of study.\n\n**Verb Agreement:**\n\nSince the subject \"analysis\" is singular, the verb must also be singular. This eliminates options \"a) reveal\" and \"d) revealed\", which are plural and past tense forms, respectively. Option \"c) revealing\" is a present participle, acting as an adjective modifying \"analysis,\" and not a verb in the present tense. \n\n**Why \"b) reveals\" is correct:**\n\nThe singular present tense verb \"reveals\" accurately reflects the singular subject \"analysis\". The sentence describes the ongoing action of the analysis revealing a startling revelation.\n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO & SBI PO:**\n\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:**  Always ensure the verb agrees with the subject in number (singular or plural).\n* **Nouns Ending in '-ics':** These words are usually singular, even though they sound plural.\n* **Identifying the Subject:** Carefully analyze the sentence structure to identify the true subject, paying attention to prepositions and phrases. \n* **Context is Key:** Understanding the context of the sentence is crucial for choosing the correct verb tense and form.\n\nBy mastering these concepts and practicing with similar questions, aspiring candidates can improve their performance in the verbal ability section of these competitive exams. \n",

While the question doesn't explicitly involve \"or\" or \"nor\", it highlights the importance of identifying the **true subject** of the sentence, even when multiple nouns are present. Let's break down why the correct answer is **(a) was**:\n\n1. **Identifying the Subject:** The sentence's main subject is \"**committee**\".  Although the phrase \"comprised of both senior executives and a group of highly specialized consultants\" describes the committee, it doesn't change the subject's singular form. \n2. **Collective Nouns:**  \"Committee\" is a **collective noun**, representing a group of individuals. When a collective noun acts as a single unit, it takes a **singular verb**. This is the case here, as the committee is acting as a cohesive entity in its decision-making process.\n3. **Verb Agreement:** Since the subject \"committee\" is singular, the verb must also be singular.  Therefore, the correct verb is \"**was**,\" making option (a) the right choice.\n4. **Eliminating Other Options:**\n    * **(b) were:** This is incorrect because it uses the plural form of the verb, which doesn't agree with the singular subject \"committee.\"\n    * **(c) has been:** While this option uses the correct tense (past perfect), it doesn't agree with the singular subject \"committee.\" \n    * **(d) have been:** This option is incorrect for the same reason as (b) and (c). It uses the plural form of the verb and the wrong tense.\n\n**In essence, the key to this question is recognizing the subject \"committee\" as a singular collective noun and ensuring the verb agrees with it in number.** \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThe question highlights the importance of recognizing collective nouns. While collective nouns can sometimes take a plural verb (e.g., \"The committee were divided on the issue\"), this usually occurs when emphasizing the individual members of the group. In this case, the sentence emphasizes the committee's singular action of failing to reach a unanimous decision.\n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\nThis question demonstrates a common concept tested in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. By mastering subject-verb agreement rules, you can confidently tackle similar questions. Here's a tip:  Always identify the true subject of the sentence, even if other nouns are present.

Let's break down why:\n\n**Understanding Subject-Verb Agreement with 'All'**\n\nThe key to this question lies in understanding how \"all\" functions when it modifies a noun. \"All\" can act as a quantifier, indicating the entirety of a group. However, it doesn't always make the noun it modifies plural.\n\n**Here's how it works in this sentence:**\n\n* **\"The organizing committee... decided...\"**  - The subject is \"committee,\" a collective noun. Collective nouns are treated as singular when they act as a single unit, but they can also be plural if the focus is on the individual members. In this case, the focus is on the committee acting as a single unit, so we use the singular verb **\"has\"**.\n* **\"...all of the proposals submitted... none of them truly captured...\"** - \"All of the proposals\" modifies the committee, showing that they have considered every single proposal. This implies that the committee is acting as a group, so the verb becomes plural **\"have\"**.\n* **\"...none of them truly captured...\"**  -  \"None\" is a singular pronoun, but it refers to the plural noun \"proposals.\" This means the verb should be plural, **\"have\"**.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\n* The first verb is **\"have\"** because \"all of the proposals\" modifies the committee, indicating a collective action. \n* The second verb is **\"have\"** because \"none\" refers to the plural \"proposals\" even though it is a singular pronoun.\n\n**Important Note for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nSubject-verb agreement is a crucial topic for banking exams. These exams often feature questions that test your understanding of how singular and plural subjects and verbs work together. By practicing questions like this and understanding the nuances of \"all\" and other quantifiers, you can confidently tackle these grammar questions and achieve a higher score. \n",
