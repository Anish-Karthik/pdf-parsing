They indicate distance and number:\n    * **This/These** refer to things close to the speaker.\n    * **That/Those** refer to things further away from the speaker.\n\n* **Context of the Sentence:** The sentence mentions \"cookies on the plate\" which are \"still warm\". This implies that the cookies are close to the speaker. The sentence then refers to \"ones\" that were baked this morning, indicating multiple cookies.\n\n* **Why \"These\" is Correct:** Since the cookies are close to the speaker and there are multiple cookies, \"These\" is the correct demonstrative pronoun to use. \n\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    * **\"This\" and \"That\"** are singular and would only refer to one cookie.\n    * **\"Those\"** would be used if the cookies were further away from the speaker.\n\n**In conclusion, \"These\" is the most appropriate choice because it accurately reflects the proximity and plurality of the cookies being discussed.**\n\n**For IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\nUnderstanding demonstrative pronouns is crucial for these exams. The questions often focus on grammar and vocabulary, with a focus on correct usage in sentences. By mastering the use of \"this/these\" and \"that/those\", you can avoid common grammatical errors and improve your score. \n",

It's used to ask about ownership or possession. In this sentence, we are asking who *owns* the homework assignment.  \n\n* **\"Who's\"** is a contraction of \"who is\" and doesn't make sense in this context. It would imply a question about the identity of someone, not their possession.\n\n* **\"Whom\"** is the object form of \"who\". It's used when the pronoun is the object of a verb or preposition.  For example, \"To **whom** did you give the book?\" In this sentence, we are not asking about the object of a verb or preposition.\n\n* **\"What's\"** is a contraction of \"what is\" and doesn't relate to ownership. It would imply a question about the nature of the assignment, not who owns it.\n\n**Why this is important for banking exams:**\n\nThese kinds of questions test your understanding of basic grammar, particularly pronoun usage. This is important for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO for a few reasons:\n\n* **Communication skills:** You'll need to communicate effectively in written and spoken English in various banking roles. A strong grasp of grammar ensures clarity and professionalism.\n* **Verbal Ability Section:** Many banking exams have a Verbal Ability section that includes grammar-based questions. These questions test your knowledge of pronouns, tenses, articles, and other grammatical concepts.\n* **Overall Aptitude:** Even if the grammar questions are not directly related to banking scenarios, they assess your overall aptitude and ability to learn and apply knowledge.\n\n**Key takeaways for similar questions:**\n\n* When you see a question asking about possession or ownership, \"whose\" is likely the correct answer.\n* Pay attention to the context and the grammatical function of the pronoun. This will help you choose the correct form of the pronoun.\n* Practice using different forms of pronouns in different contexts to solidify your understanding.\n\nBy mastering these concepts, you'll be better equipped to tackle grammar questions on your banking exams and communicate effectively in your professional life. \n",

The pronoun we need is the one that receives the \"high five\". \n\n* **Choosing the Correct Pronoun:**\n\n   Since the pronoun is receiving the action, we need the object pronoun.  Of the options provided:\n   * **\"He\"** is a subject pronoun. \n   * **\"She\"** is a subject pronoun.\n   * **\"Her\"** is an object pronoun, but it is the possessive form and doesn't fit the sentence's structure. \n   * **\"Him\"** is the correct object pronoun, indicating the person receiving the high five.\n\n**Why this is important for IBPS PO/SBI PO exams:**\n\nThese exams often test your knowledge of grammar, including the proper use of pronouns.  Understanding the distinction between subject and object pronouns is crucial for constructing grammatically correct sentences and avoiding errors. \n\n**Additional Tips for Pronoun Usage:**\n\n* **Think about who is doing the action (subject) and who is receiving the action (object).**\n* **Practice identifying subject and object pronouns in various sentences.**\n* **Look for clues in the sentence to determine which pronoun is needed.**\n* **Be careful with possessive pronouns (mine, yours, his, hers, its, ours, theirs) and ensure they are used correctly.**\n\nBy mastering pronoun usage, you'll strengthen your grammar skills and increase your chances of success in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

They also act as the subject or object within the dependent clause.\n* **\"Who\" and \"Whom\":**  Both refer to people. The difference lies in their grammatical function:\n    * **\"Who\"** acts as the **subject** of the verb within the dependent clause. Example: \"The girl **who** won the competition is my friend.\" (Here, \"who\" is the subject of the verb \"won\")\n    * **\"Whom\"** acts as the **object** of a verb or preposition within the dependent clause. Example: \"The girl **whom** I met at the competition is my friend.\" (Here, \"whom\" is the object of the preposition \"to\" in the phrase \"to whom I met.\")\n* **\"Which\"** refers to things or animals. Example: \"The book **which** I borrowed is on the table.\"\n* **\"Whose\"** shows possession or ownership. Example: \"The girl **whose** voice impressed me won the competition.\"\n\nIn our sentence, \"The girl ____ won the singing competition is my best friend,\" we need a relative pronoun to connect the dependent clause \"____ won the singing competition\" to the independent clause \"The girl is my best friend.\" The dependent clause describes the girl, so we need a pronoun that refers to a person.  \n\nSince the pronoun is acting as the subject of the verb \"won,\" the correct option is **\"who.\"** \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **B - \"that\"** and here's why:\n\n* **Relative Pronouns:**  Relative pronouns (like \"who,\" \"which,\" \"that,\" and \"whom\") connect a dependent clause (a clause that can't stand alone) to a main clause. They act as the subject or object within the dependent clause and refer to a noun in the main clause.\n\n* **Choosing the Right Relative Pronoun:**\n\n    * **\"That\"**: \"That\" is used for both people and things. It's the most versatile relative pronoun and can be used in both restrictive and non-restrictive clauses. \n    * **\"Who\"**: \"Who\" is used for people.  \n    * **\"Which\"**: \"Which\" is used for things.\n    * **\"Whom\"**: \"Whom\" is the object form of \"who\" and is used for people in the object position of the dependent clause.\n\n* **Analyzing the Sentence:**\n\n    In the sentence, \"The dog ____ chased the ball down the street was very happy,\" we need a relative pronoun to connect the noun \"dog\" to the dependent clause \"chased the ball down the street.\"  This clause describes which specific dog is being referred to.  \n\n    Since the clause describes a dog (a thing), we need a relative pronoun that can be used for both people and things. This eliminates \"who\" and \"whom,\" which are only for people.  \"Which\" can be used for things, but \"that\" is the preferred choice in this case. \n\n* **Restrictive vs. Non-Restrictive Clauses:**\n\n    The clause \"chased the ball down the street\" is a restrictive clause. Restrictive clauses provide essential information that is necessary to identify the noun being described. The clause tells us exactly which dog is being talked about (the one who chased the ball).\n\n    In restrictive clauses, \"that\" is generally preferred over \"which.\"\n\n* **Why \"that\" is the Correct Choice:**\n\n    The sentence \"The dog that chased the ball down the street was very happy\" clearly and concisely conveys that the dog who chased the ball was happy. The relative pronoun \"that\" acts as the subject of the dependent clause, smoothly connecting the two parts of the sentence. \n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nUnderstanding the rules of relative pronouns and their appropriate usage is crucial for effective communication and answering grammar-based questions in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Practice recognizing restrictive and non-restrictive clauses and choose the right relative pronoun based on the context and the noun being referred to. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **\"These\"** and here's why:\n\n1. **Understanding Demonstrative Pronouns:** Demonstrative pronouns (this, that, these, those) are used to point out specific nouns or pronouns. They indicate proximity (near or far) and number (singular or plural).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Sentence:** The sentence describes a collection of \"ancient artifacts\" which are \"on display\". This indicates a plural noun, meaning we need a pronoun that refers to multiple items.\n\n3. **Eliminating Incorrect Options:**\n    * **\"This\" and \"That\"** are singular pronouns and are incorrect because they only refer to one artifact, not a collection.\n    * **\"Those\"** is used for items that are farther away from the speaker. Since the sentence doesn't specify distance, \"These\" is a better fit.\n\n4. **Why \"These\" is Correct:**  \"These\" is the correct pronoun because it:\n    * is plural, referring to the multiple artifacts on display.\n    * suggests proximity, as the speaker is likely close enough to see the artifacts.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Demonstrative Pronoun Usage:**\n    * **This/These:**  Used for items close to the speaker.\n    * **That/Those:** Used for items farther away from the speaker.\n\n* **IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**  Understanding demonstrative pronouns is crucial for language proficiency and verbal ability sections of these exams. These sections often test grammatical concepts like pronoun usage, making it an important topic to master.\n\n**Applying the Knowledge:**\n\nTo tackle similar questions on demonstrative pronouns, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the noun the pronoun is referring to.\n2. Determine if the noun is singular or plural.\n3. Consider the proximity of the noun to the speaker (near or far).\n4. Choose the appropriate demonstrative pronoun based on the number and proximity.\n\nBy understanding these simple rules and applying them consistently, you can confidently answer questions on demonstrative pronouns in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

They act as the subject or object within the dependent clause. In this case, the dependent clause is \"**whose CEO was recently awarded for his innovative leadership**\".\n\n* **\"Whose\" for Possession:**  The pronoun \"whose\" specifically indicates **possession**.

Their role is to ensure that the system runs smoothly and avoids major disruptions.\n\n* **Regulating the Money Supply:** The central bank controls the amount of money circulating in the economy. This is done through various tools like:\n    * **Setting Interest Rates:**  By changing interest rates, the central bank influences borrowing and lending, ultimately impacting the amount of money in circulation.\n    * **Reserve Requirements:**  They mandate the percentage of deposits banks must hold as reserves, limiting the amount of money they can lend out.\n    * **Open Market Operations:** They buy or sell government bonds to inject or withdraw money from the market.\n\n* **Maintaining Financial Stability:**  The central bank's actions aim to prevent major financial crises. They achieve this by:\n    * **Controlling Inflation:** They aim to keep inflation within a manageable range to ensure the value of money remains stable. \n    * **Supervising Banks:** They monitor banks' financial health to prevent risky lending practices and ensure the safety of depositors' money.\n    * **Acting as Lender of Last Resort:** In emergencies, they provide loans to banks facing solvency issues, preventing a domino effect of failures.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(a) To provide loans to individuals and businesses:** While commercial banks provide loans, this is not the primary function of a central bank.

This means the pronoun used should be in the form used for the subject of a sentence. \n* **Pronoun Cases:**  There are three cases for pronouns:\n    * **Nominative:** Used for the subject of a sentence (e.g., **I**, **he**, **she**, **we**, **they**)\n    * **Objective:** Used for the object of a verb or preposition (e.g., **me**, **him**, **her**, **us**, **them**)\n    * **Possessive:** Shows ownership (e.g., **my**, **his**, **her**, **our**, **their**)\n* **Analysis:** Since the pronoun in the blank functions as the subject complement, it needs to be in the nominative case. Of the given options:\n    * **\"he\"** is in the nominative case and is correct.\n    * **\"him\"**, **\"they\"**, and **\"them\"** are in the objective case and are incorrect.\n\n**Therefore, \"he\" is the only correct option because it is in the nominative case, making it the correct subject complement.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Pronoun Case Errors:** Errors in pronoun case are common, especially when using subject complements or in complex sentence structures. Knowing the rules of nominative, objective, and possessive cases is essential for accurate and clear writing.\n* **Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO:** These exams often test grammar and vocabulary, making understanding pronoun cases crucial for success. \n\n**Learning Tip:**  Practice identifying subject complements in sentences and then use the correct pronoun case based on their function. This skill will help you avoid common grammatical errors and improve your writing. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **\"C. they\"**. Here's why:\n\n* **Antecedent:** The antecedent is the word or phrase that a pronoun refers to. In this case, the antecedent is \"committee.\"\n* **Collective Noun:** \"Committee\" is a collective noun. It refers to a group of people, but it is grammatically treated as singular. \n* **Pronoun Agreement:**  Pronouns must agree with their antecedents in number (singular or plural) and person (first, second, or third). \n* **Context:** The phrase \"for their dedication\" indicates the CEO is praising the **individual members** of the committee.  This means we need a plural pronoun.\n* **Incorrect Options:**\n    * **\"it\"**:  While \"it\" can refer to the committee as a singular entity, the phrase \"for their dedication\"  makes it clear the CEO is recognizing the individual efforts.\n    * **\"them\"**: \"Them\" is the objective case of the pronoun and is used as the object of a verb or preposition. It doesn't fit the grammatical structure of the sentence.\n    * **\"their\"**: \"Their\" is a possessive pronoun indicating ownership. It doesn't fit the grammatical structure of the sentence.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nWhen dealing with collective nouns, the key is to look at the context. If the sentence refers to the group as a singular entity, use a singular pronoun. However, if the sentence focuses on the individual members within the group, use a plural pronoun. \n\n**For IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis concept of pronoun agreement with antecedents is crucial for both IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. These exams often include questions testing your understanding of grammar, including pronoun agreement.

The possessive form of the pronoun \"he\" is \"his\".\n\n3. **Parenthetical Phrase:** The phrase \"along with his team\" is a parenthetical phrase, which means it can be removed from the sentence without affecting the grammatical structure.

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Intensive Pronouns:**\n\nIntensive pronouns (also called emphatic pronouns) are used to add emphasis to a noun or pronoun already present in the sentence. They are used to highlight the subject performing the action. Common intensive pronouns include:\n\n* **myself**\n* **yourself**\n* **himself**\n* **herself**\n* **itself**\n* **ourselves**\n* **yourselves**\n* **themselves**\n\n**Applying to the Question:**\n\nThe sentence focuses on the artist's act of self-portraiture. The phrase \"by portraying himself in this manner\" highlights the artist as both the subject and the performer of the action. The use of the intensive pronoun **\"himself\"** emphasizes this duality:\n\n* **Subject:** The artist is the subject of the sentence.\n* **Action:** The artist is the one performing the act of self-portraiture.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **\"herself\":** This pronoun refers to a female subject. The context does not specify the artist's gender.\n* **\"itself\":** This pronoun refers to an inanimate object. It is grammatically inappropriate in this context because the artist is a person.\n* **\"themselves\":** This pronoun is plural and refers to multiple subjects. The sentence focuses on a single artist.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of English grammar, specifically the use of intensive pronouns. These exams frequently include sections on English Language, which often feature questions on grammar, vocabulary, and comprehension. Understanding intensive pronouns is essential for constructing grammatically correct and impactful sentences, a crucial skill in written communication and comprehension. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nIntensive pronouns are often used to clarify who is performing an action, especially when the sentence contains multiple subjects. They help to distinguish the subject performing the action from other possible subjects. \n\n**Example:**\n\n* \"The artist painted the portrait **himself**.\"  (Here, \"himself\" emphasizes that the artist, and not someone else, painted the portrait.)\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nWhen encountering questions about intensive pronouns, remember to identify the subject of the sentence and the action being performed. Choose the pronoun that correctly emphasizes the subject performing the action. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Pronoun Case**\n\nPronouns have different forms depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. The two main cases relevant here are:\n\n* **Nominative Case:** Used for the subject of a verb. (e.g., *I*, *we*, *he*, *she*, *they*)\n* **Objective Case:** Used for the object of a verb or preposition. (e.g., *me*, *us*, *him*, *her*, *them*)\n\n**The Role of Prepositions**\n\nPrepositions like \"to,\" \"for,\" \"with,\" and \"from\" introduce prepositional phrases, which function as either adjectives or adverbs. They are always followed by a noun or pronoun, which acts as the *object of the preposition*.  \n\n**Analyzing the Sentence**\n\nIn the sentence: \"The news of the company's restructuring, which had been rumored for weeks, came as a shock to all of [blank] who were directly affected by the decision, including the employees in the marketing department and the sales team.\", we need to identify the pronoun's function within the prepositional phrase \"to all of [blank]\".\n\n* **\"to\"** is the preposition.\n* **\"all\"** is the noun that is the object of the preposition.\n* The pronoun must function as the object of the preposition \"to\".\n\n**Why \"us\" is Correct**\n\nSince the pronoun is the object of the preposition \"to\", the objective case is required.  \"Us\" is the objective case of the pronoun \"we,\" making it the correct choice.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **\"we\"** is the nominative case and therefore incorrect.\n* **\"ourselves\"** is a reflexive pronoun, used when the subject and object are the same. It doesn't fit the sentence's meaning.\n* **\"ours\"** is a possessive pronoun and cannot be the object of a preposition.\n\n**Key takeaway for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\nThe correct pronoun case after a preposition is crucial for grammatical accuracy. Mastering this concept will help you correctly answer questions in English language sections of competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Always identify the prepositional phrase and the role of the pronoun within it to choose the correct pronoun case. \n",

They are used before nouns to describe something belonging to a specific person or thing.

Correctly identifying and using relative pronouns is essential for clear and accurate writing and understanding complex sentences.\n\n**Example:**\n\nConsider another sentence: \"The ancient city, **which** was once a bustling center of trade, now lies in ruins.\" This sentence is non-restrictive, meaning the information about the city's past is additional.  \"Which\" is used correctly because the clause is non-restrictive and set off by commas. \n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\n* Remember the function of relative pronouns in connecting clauses.\n* Differentiate between restrictive and non-restrictive clauses and their corresponding relative pronouns.\n* Pay attention to the antecedent and its nature (person or thing).\n\nBy understanding these concepts, you'll be better prepared to answer questions related to relative pronouns on the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Pronoun Agreement:**\n\n* **Indefinite Pronouns:**  These pronouns don't refer to a specific person or thing. Examples: *none*, *some*, *any*, *all*, *each*, *every*.\n* **Pronoun Agreement:** Pronouns must agree with their antecedents (the words they refer to) in number (singular or plural).\n\n**Applying the Concept to the Sentence:**\n\n1. **Antecedent:** The antecedent in the sentence is \"**none of the proposed strategies**\". This phrase is plural because it refers to multiple strategies. \n2. **Pronoun:** The blank requires a pronoun that refers to the \"strategies\".\n3. **Correct Pronoun:** \"Those\" is the only plural pronoun among the options, making it the correct choice. It agrees with the plural antecedent \"strategies\".\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **It, One:** These are singular pronouns and don't agree with the plural antecedent \"strategies\".\n* **They:**  While \"they\" is plural, it's unclear what it refers to in this sentence. There's no prior mention of any specific strategies that could be represented by \"they\".\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\nPronoun agreement is a fundamental grammar concept tested frequently in these exams. You'll encounter questions where you need to identify the correct pronoun based on its antecedent. Mastering this concept is crucial for achieving good scores in English Language sections.\n\n**Here are some tips for pronoun agreement:**\n\n* **Identify the antecedent:** Carefully determine the word or phrase that the pronoun refers to.\n* **Check for number:** Ensure the pronoun is singular or plural depending on the antecedent. \n* **Avoid ambiguity:** Choose pronouns that clearly and unambiguously refer to their antecedents.\n\nBy understanding these rules and practicing with various examples, you can confidently answer pronoun agreement questions in your banking exams. \n",

Collective nouns refer to a group of people or things. \n   * **Agreement:**  While \"committee\" is singular in form, in this context, we are referring to the actions of the members of the committee working together.  Therefore, we need a **plural verb**  to agree with the plural idea of the committee's members working together. Hence, **\"are\"** is the correct choice.\n\n2. **\"...which will be presented at the international conference,  ___  expected to have a significant impact on the field of research.\"**\n\n   * **Subject:**  The subject of this clause is \"report\".\n   * **Agreement:** \"Report\" is singular, and the sentence is referring to the impact of the report as a whole. So, the verb should be singular as well. Therefore,  **\"is\"** is the correct choice.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** \n\n* While collective nouns are singular in form, they can take either a singular or plural verb depending on whether the sentence emphasizes the group as a single unit or the individual members of the group. In this case, the sentence emphasizes the members of the committee working together, so a plural verb is required.\n* The sentence also demonstrates how understanding the context of the sentence can help you determine the correct verb to use, even when the subject is singular.\n\n**For IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nMastering subject-verb agreement is crucial for these exams. These exams often test your understanding of grammar rules in various contexts.  \n\n**Tips for Success:**\n\n* **Practice:** Practice regularly with different types of sentences and collective nouns to strengthen your understanding.\n* **Identify Subjects:** Clearly identify the subject of the sentence to determine its number (singular or plural).\n* **Understand Collective Nouns:** Pay attention to how collective nouns are used in sentences and whether they refer to the group as a whole or its individual members.\n* **Review Grammar Rules:**  Refer to grammar resources and practice exercises to refresh your knowledge of subject-verb agreement. \n",

Let's break down why:\n\n* **Relative Pronouns:** Relative pronouns connect a dependent clause (a clause that cannot stand alone) to a main clause. They act as the subject or object of the dependent clause and refer back to a noun in the main clause. Common relative pronouns include \"who,\" \"whom,\" \"whose,\" \"which,\" and \"that.\"\n\n* **\"Whose\"** is used to show **possession**. It specifically refers to the possession of a person or an entity. In this sentence, \"whose\" connects the dependent clause \"works had been exhibited in prestigious galleries worldwide\" to the noun \"artist.\" It clarifies that the works being exhibited belong to the artist. \n\n* **\"Whom\"** is used for **objects** of verbs or prepositions. It wouldn't be correct here because the works are not the object of the verb \"announced.\" \n\n* **\"Which\"** is used for **things** or **non-human entities**. While it could be used in the second relative clause (referring to the exhibition), it is not the most appropriate choice for the first clause as it refers to the artist's works, which are a possession.\n\n* **\"That\"** can be used for both **people and things**, but \"whose\" is preferred when referring to a possession, especially in a defining relative clause.\n\n**Therefore, the sentence correctly uses \"whose\" in the first relative clause because it demonstrates the artist's ownership of the works. **\n\n**Example for the Second Clause:**\n\nThe second relative clause, \"____ would feature some of his most iconic pieces and lesser-known works from his personal collection,\"  also requires a relative pronoun to connect it to the main clause.

Here's a more detailed breakdown to help you understand the concept of demonstrative pronouns and how they apply to this specific question:\n\n**Demonstrative Pronouns:**\n\nDemonstrative pronouns point to specific nouns or noun phrases. They indicate the proximity of the noun to the speaker or writer, both in terms of space and time. There are four demonstrative pronouns in English:\n\n* **This/These:** Used for things that are close to the speaker/writer in space and time.\n* **That/Those:** Used for things that are further away from the speaker/writer in space and time.\n\n**Applying it to the Question:**\n\nIn the given sentence,  \"___ discovery of extraterrestrial life, if it were to be confirmed, would fundamentally alter our understanding of the universe and our place within it\", the speaker is referring to the **discovery of extraterrestrial life** as the most recent topic of discussion.  \n\n* The statement directly follows the panel discussion about the ethics and consequences of finding alien life.\n* \"This\" is the most appropriate choice because it points to something that is close in time and context \u2013 the very event being discussed.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **\"That\"** implies distance, both in space and time.  Since the discovery is the immediate topic, \"that\" would be incorrect.\n* **\"These\" and \"Those\"** are plural forms and are used to refer to more than one item. The discovery of extraterrestrial life is singular, making \"These\" and \"Those\" grammatically incorrect.\n\n**Key Takeaway for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding demonstrative pronouns is crucial for English language proficiency, which is tested in these competitive exams.  Here's how this knowledge can help you:\n\n* **Sentence Correction:** Questions often test your ability to identify and correct grammatical errors. Recognizing demonstrative pronouns and their proper usage will help you spot incorrect pronoun choices.\n* **Reading Comprehension:** Understanding the context and nuances of language is essential for answering reading comprehension questions accurately.  Knowing when to use \"this\" vs \"that\" helps you grasp the author's intended meaning.\n* **Vocabulary:** While demonstrative pronouns are simple words, they are crucial for conveying specific information and building clear, concise sentences.  This vocabulary is essential for written communication in any professional setting.\n\n**Practice Tip:**\n\nTry practicing with various sentences and questions to solidify your understanding of demonstrative pronouns. Focus on identifying the noun being referred to and its proximity to the speaker/writer. This will help you choose the correct pronoun for each situation. \n",

It doesn't fit the context of the sentence, which describes the CEO's feelings and not her possession.\n    * **(d) she:** While \"she\" is grammatically correct, it creates a clumsy sentence structure by repeating the subject \"CEO\". Using \"who\" creates a more concise and elegant sentence.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe correct pronoun \"who\" accurately reflects the grammatical structure of the sentence and ensures clarity in conveying the CEO's continued confidence despite her reservations. This choice demonstrates a clear understanding of pronoun usage in formal writing, a crucial skill for any candidate preparing for competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Pronoun Usage in Formal Writing:**  IBPS PO and SBI PO exams often test candidates' ability to use correct grammar, including pronoun usage. Formal writing demands precise and clear language, and using the appropriate pronouns is essential for conveying meaning effectively.\n* **Relative Clauses:** Understanding how relative clauses function is key to using pronouns correctly within them. A relative clause provides additional information about a noun in the main clause. It is introduced by a relative pronoun like \"who\", \"which\", or \"that\". \n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The pronoun in a relative clause must agree with the verb in the clause. For example, if the pronoun is singular, the verb must also be singular. \n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing pronoun usage exercises, candidates can improve their grammar skills and confidently tackle pronoun-related questions in their banking exams. \n",
