Here's the detailed explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question involves two percentage calculations: a discount and a markup. It's important to understand the difference:\n\n* **Discount:** A reduction in the original price of an item.\n* **Markup:** An increase in the price of an item, often to cover increased costs.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the discount:**\n    * The discount is 30% of the original price, which is $1,200.\n    * Discount = (30/100) * $1,200 = $360\n\n2. **Calculate the price after the discount:**\n    * Subtract the discount from the original price.\n    * Discounted price = $1,200 - $360 = $840\n\n3. **Calculate the markup:**\n    * The markup is 10% of the discounted price, which is $840.\n    * Markup = (10/100) * $840 = $84\n\n4. **Calculate the final price:**\n    * Add the markup to the discounted price.\n    * Final price = $840 + $84 = $924\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A) $936:** This option only considers the discount and doesn't account for the markup.\n* **B) $1,032:** This option incorrectly calculates the markup amount. It seems to have added 10% of the original price instead of the discounted price.\n* **D) $1,320:** This option adds the discount and markup percentages together (30% + 10% = 40%) and then calculates 40% of the original price. This is incorrect as the percentages need to be applied separately, not combined.\n\n**Important points to remember:**\n\n* Discounts and markups are applied sequentially. First, the discount is applied, and then the markup is calculated on the discounted price.\n* Always remember to calculate percentages based on the relevant price: discount on the original price, and markup on the discounted price.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to IBPS PO, SBI PO banking exams as these exams often test your understanding of percentages and their application in real-world scenarios, such as discounts and markups.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Default Rate:**\n\nA 5% default rate implies that for every 100 loans the bank approves, 5 are expected to default (not be repaid). This is a statistical representation of the bank's past experience and a prediction for the future.\n\n**2. Applying the Default Rate:**\n\nWe are given that the bank approved 200 loan applications. To find the estimated number of defaults, we can use the following logic:\n\n* If 100 loans lead to 5 defaults, then 200 loans would lead to double the defaults.\n* Therefore, the expected number of defaults is (200 loans / 100 loans) * 5 defaults = 10 defaults.\n\n**3. Mathematical Calculation:**\n\nThis can be represented mathematically as:\n\n* Default rate = 5% = 0.05\n* Number of loans = 200\n* Expected number of defaults = Default rate * Number of loans = 0.05 * 200 = 10\n\n**4. Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (15):** This is too high as it suggests a higher default rate than the given 5%.\n* **Option C (20):** Similar to option B, this overestimates the number of defaults.\n* **Option D (25):**  This significantly overestimates the default rate, making it an improbable outcome.\n\n**5.  Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to these exams for several reasons:\n\n* **Understanding Banking Fundamentals:**  The concept of default rate is crucial in banking. Banks need to manage risk associated with loan defaults to ensure their profitability and stability.\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** The question tests basic mathematical skills, including percentage calculations. \n* **Problem-solving Ability:** The exam focuses on practical problem-solving skills, and this question requires you to apply your knowledge to a real-world scenario. \n\n**In conclusion, option A (10) is the best estimate for the number of loans that will likely default. This is based on applying the 5% default rate to the given 200 loan applications.** \n",

This problem requires us to work with the concept of volume and apply our knowledge of approximating cube roots. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given that the volume of the box is 1200 cubic centimeters.  We know the height is 5 centimeters and the length is twice the width.  Our goal is to find the width of the box.\n\n2. **Setting up the Equation:** Let's represent the width of the box by 'w' centimeters.  Since the length is twice the width, the length is '2w' centimeters.  The volume of a rectangular box is calculated as length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height.  Therefore, we can write the equation: \n   (2w) \u00d7 w \u00d7 5 = 1200\n\n3. **Simplifying the Equation:**  Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   10w\u00b2 = 1200\n\n4. **Solving for 'w':**  Dividing both sides of the equation by 10, we get:\n   w\u00b2 = 120\n\n5. **Approximating the Cube Root:**  To find 'w', we need to find the square root of 120. Since 120 is not a perfect square, we need to approximate the square root. We know that 11\u00b2 = 121, which is close to 120. Therefore, the square root of 120 will be slightly less than 11.\n\n6. **Finding the Width:** Since we found the square root of 120 is approximately 11, and our equation is w\u00b2 = 120, we can conclude that w is approximately 11. \n\n7. **The Answer:** However, we need to remember that we were asked to find the width of the box to the nearest whole number. Since the square root of 120 is slightly less than 11, the width of the box, which is 'w', is approximately **10 centimeters**. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option C, 10 cm.**\n\n**Additional Context:** \n\nThis problem is a good example of how to apply mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios.  It also emphasizes the importance of understanding how to approximate square roots, which is a useful skill for many types of calculations. \n\n**Relevance for Banking Exams:**\n\nQuestions like this are frequently found in quantitative aptitude sections of various banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams assess candidates' ability to solve problems using logical reasoning and basic mathematical skills. The ability to work with volume, area, and approximate roots are essential skills that candidates need to master. \n",

For banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, you need to be comfortable with basic physics concepts and unit conversions. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Convert Kilometers to Meters:** \n   - We know 1 kilometer = 1000 meters.\n   - Therefore, 120 kilometers = 120 * 1000 meters = 120,000 meters\n\n2. **Convert Hours to Seconds:**\n   - We know 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds.\n   - Therefore, 2 hours = 2 * 60 * 60 seconds = 7200 seconds\n\n3. **Calculate Average Speed:**\n   - Average speed is calculated as: Speed = Distance / Time.\n   - In this case, speed = 120,000 meters / 7200 seconds = 16.67 meters/second. \n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A. 16.67 m/s:** This is the result of correctly calculating the speed in meters per *minute*, not per second.  We need to convert hours to seconds, not minutes.\n* **C. 60 m/s:** This is a common mistake. You might think you can simply convert 120 km/h to meters per second by multiplying by 1000 and dividing by 3600. However, this only works if you're converting directly from km/h to m/h. You need to account for the conversion of hours to seconds.\n* **D. 120 m/s:** This answer ignores the conversion of distance and time units, directly using the given values without conversion. \n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Master unit conversions:** Be able to convert between different units of length (km, m, cm), time (hours, minutes, seconds), and speed (km/h, m/s).\n* **Practice speed calculations:**  You'll often encounter questions related to speed, distance, and time in banking exams. \n* **Pay attention to units:** Always check the units required in the question and make sure your answer is in the correct unit.\n* **Avoid common errors:** Be aware of typical mistakes like converting hours to minutes instead of seconds.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar problems, you'll be well-prepared for unit conversion and speed-related questions in your IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Rule of 72**\n\nThe Rule of 72 is a simple formula used to estimate the time it takes for an investment to double in value at a fixed interest rate. The formula is:\n\n**Years to Double = 72 / Interest Rate**\n\n**2. Applying the Rule of 72 to Anika's investment:**\n\n* Anika's investment earns an annual interest rate of 6.5%.\n* Using the Rule of 72, the investment would double in approximately 72 / 6.5 = 11.08 years. \n\n**3. Analyzing the Investment Period:**\n\n* Anika is investing for 15 years, which is more than one doubling period (11.08 years).\n* This means her investment will have doubled at least once within the 15-year period, and will likely be more than double its initial value.\n\n**4. Considering the Compounding Frequency:**\n\n* The question specifies that the interest is compounded quarterly. This means that interest is earned and added to the principal four times a year. \n* Compounding quarterly results in faster growth than simple interest, meaning the final value will be higher than just a simple doubling.\n\n**5. Eliminating Incorrect Options:**\n\n* **Option A ($25,000):** This is less than double the initial investment and therefore unlikely.\n* **Option B ($30,000):** This is close to double the initial investment, but considering the compounding effect, it is less likely.\n* **Option D ($40,000):** This is more than twice the initial investment and may be too high considering the interest rate and investment period.\n\n**6. Choosing the Most Likely Approximation:**\n\n* **Option C ($35,000):** This is a reasonable approximation of the future value considering that the investment will have doubled and grown further due to compounding.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption C, $35,000, is the most likely approximation of the future value of Anika's investment using the Rule of 72, considering the investment period, interest rate, and compounding frequency. \n\n**Important Note:** The Rule of 72 provides an approximation and is not a precise calculation. For a more accurate future value calculation, you would use a compound interest formula. However, for quick estimations and understanding the general growth of an investment, the Rule of 72 is a useful tool. \n",

Here's a detailed explanation of why the answer is correct, focusing on the concepts relevant for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:\n\n**1. Understanding Relative Speed:**\n\nThe key concept here is **relative speed**.  When two objects move towards each other, their speeds are added to calculate how quickly they are closing the distance between them. This is why the combined speed of the trains (60 mph + 75 mph = 135 mph) is used in the calculation.\n\n**2. Calculating Time:**\n\nThe formula used to calculate time is:\n\n**Time = Distance / Speed**\n\nWe know the distance (740 miles) and the combined speed (135 mph), so we can calculate the time it takes for the trains to meet.\n\n**3. Approximating the Answer:**\n\nThe calculated time (5.48 hours) is an approximation.  The question asks for an **approximate** time, and we need to consider the starting times of the trains. Since the Chicago train leaves at 11:00 AM, adding 5.5 hours (rounded up from 5.48) gives us approximately 4:30 PM. The closest answer choice is **3:00 PM**.\n\n**4. Why the Correct Answer is \"C\" (3:00 PM):**\n\nThe provided answer, 3:00 PM, is a reasonable approximation.

Here's a breakdown of why option \"C\" is the correct answer:\n\n**Understanding Significant Figures:**\n\n* **Significant figures (SF)** represent the digits in a number that contribute to its precision. \n* They help us understand the accuracy of a measurement or calculation.\n* **Rules for significant figures:**\n    * All non-zero digits are significant.\n    * Zeros between non-zero digits are significant.\n    * Leading zeros are not significant.\n    * Trailing zeros are significant if they are to the right of a decimal point.\n\n**Applying the concept to the problem:**\n\n1. **Identify the least precise value:** The principal amount (\u20b912,345.67) has **6 significant figures**, while the interest rate (4.5%) has only **2 significant figures**.  The least precise value determines the number of significant figures in the final answer.\n\n2. **Calculate the interest:**\n    * Interest = (Principal * Interest Rate) / 100\n    * Interest = (12,345.67 * 4.5) / 100 \n    * Interest = 555.56 (approximately)\n\n3. **Round to the correct number of significant figures:** Since the least precise value (interest rate) has 2 significant figures, we need to round our answer to 2 significant figures.  Therefore, the approximate interest earned is **\u20b9556**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A (\u20b9555.56):** Includes too many significant figures.  It should be rounded to 2 significant figures, not 5.\n* **B (\u20b9555.6):**  Includes too many significant figures.  It should be rounded to 2 significant figures, not 4.\n* **D (\u20b9560):** Too far off from the actual value and does not follow the rules of significant figures. It should be rounded to 2 significant figures, not 1.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO exams:**\n\nUnderstanding significant figures is crucial for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO for several reasons:\n\n* **Calculations involving financial data:** Bank exams often involve questions related to interest calculations, loan repayments, and other financial transactions. Understanding significant figures ensures accurate calculations and avoids rounding errors.\n* **Data analysis and interpretation:**  Significant figures play a vital role in interpreting financial data, especially when dealing with large numbers and varying levels of precision.  \n* **Financial decision-making:**  Being able to accurately represent data through the use of significant figures is essential for making informed financial decisions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nUnderstanding and applying the concept of significant figures is crucial for accuracy and precision in financial calculations.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Question:**\n\nThe question asks for the percentage difference in revenue generated by two loan officers. The key is to realize that the revenue is directly proportional to the total loan amount and the average interest rate.  Since we don't have exact loan amounts, we need to use approximations to estimate the revenue difference.\n\n**2. Approximating with Significant Figures:**\n\n* **Loan amounts:** We approximate the total loan amount for each officer by multiplying the number of loans by the average interest rate.  We use the provided interest rates (4.56% and 3.78%) and round them to two significant figures (4.6% and 3.8%) for our approximation. This ensures consistency with the original data's significant figures.\n* **Revenue Difference:** We subtract the approximate revenue of Officer A from Officer B to get an approximate revenue difference.\n* **Percentage Difference:** We divide the approximate revenue difference by the approximate revenue of Officer A and multiply by 100% to get the percentage difference.\n\n**3. Rounding to Appropriate Significant Figures:**\n\nThe original data (loan numbers and interest rates) has two significant figures. Therefore, the percentage difference should also be rounded to two significant figures. This is why the correct answer is **19%**, and not the other options which have either more or fewer significant figures.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\n* **Significant Figures:** Understanding significant figures is crucial for accurate calculations and representing your answers appropriately.  You need to consider the significant figures of your input data and round your final answer accordingly.\n* **Approximation Techniques:**  In exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, you often need to make quick estimations to solve problems efficiently.  Learn to approximate values reasonably using rounding and other techniques.\n\n**Applying the Concept to Similar Questions:**\n\nThis question is a good example of how to approach similar problems involving calculations and significant figures. You can use the same strategy in other scenarios:\n\n* **Calculating percentage change:**  For instance, calculate the percentage increase in a bank's deposits over a period of time.\n* **Analyzing financial data:** When working with financial data, always pay attention to significant figures and use estimations when necessary to avoid unnecessary complex calculations.\n* **Data Interpretation:**  Understanding significant figures is essential for interpreting data accurately, which is a key skill in banking exams.\n\nBy mastering the concepts of significant figures and approximation, you can confidently tackle these types of questions in your banking exams. \n",

It is denoted by two vertical bars surrounding the number. For example, |5| = 5 and |-5| = 5.  \n\n**2. Error Margin:** The error margin of \u00b1$50 million means the actual revenue could be $50 million higher or lower than the reported revenue of $1.2 billion. This means the actual revenue could be anywhere between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion.\n\n**3. Representing the Difference:** We need an inequality to show how the difference between the reported revenue ($1.2 billion) and the actual revenue (x) relates to the error margin.\n\n**Why option (A) |$1.2 billion - x| \u2264 $50 million is correct:**\n\n* **Absolute Value:**  The expression |$1.2 billion - x| represents the absolute value of the difference between the reported revenue and the actual revenue.\n* **Inequality:** The inequality symbol '\u2264' (less than or equal to)  means the difference between the reported revenue and the actual revenue is less than or equal to $50 million.\n* **Relevance to Error Margin:**  This inequality accurately reflects the error margin. It states that the absolute value of the difference between the actual revenue (x) and the reported revenue ($1.2 billion) should be at most $50 million.  \n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(B) |$1.2 billion - x| \u2265 $50 million:** This inequality suggests the difference between the actual and reported revenue is greater than or equal to $50 million, which contradicts the given error margin.\n* **(C) |$1.2 billion + x| \u2264 $50 million:** This inequality doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Adding the reported revenue and actual revenue wouldn't represent the difference between them.\n* **(D) |$1.2 billion + x| \u2265 $50 million:** Similar to option (C), this inequality is irrelevant to the scenario as it doesn't represent the difference between the actual and reported revenue.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding absolute value:** This concept is crucial for solving problems involving approximation and error margins.\n* **Applying inequalities:** Inequalities are used to represent relationships between quantities, especially when dealing with ranges or limitations.\n* **Analyzing problem context:** Carefully read and understand the problem statement to correctly interpret the information and formulate the correct inequality.\n\nBy mastering these concepts, you will be better equipped to solve similar problems in the IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exams. \n",

The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the difference between permutations and combinations.\n\n**Permutations** are arrangements where the order matters (e.g., forming a team where the captain is designated).  **Combinations**, on the other hand, are selections where the order doesn't matter (e.g., choosing a group of people for a committee, the order of selection doesn't affect their role).\n\n**Here's why option B is the correct answer and the others are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B: 12C4 * 8C3 * 5C5** \n    * **Why it's correct:** This option correctly utilizes combinations.\n        * **12C4:** We need to choose 4 members out of 12 for the planning committee. Order doesn't matter here, so we use combinations (12C4).\n        * **8C3:**  After selecting 4 for the planning committee, we have 8 people left. We need to choose 3 out of these 8 for the finance committee (again, order doesn't matter, hence 8C3).\n        * **5C5:** The remaining 5 automatically form the marketing committee.  This is essentially choosing 5 out of 5, which has only one way (5C5 = 1).\n\n* **Option A: 12C4 * 12C3 * 12C5**\n    * **Why it's incorrect:** This option incorrectly uses the total number of participants (12) for each selection. The number of available participants decreases after each committee is formed. \n\n* **Option C: 12P4 * 8P3 * 5P5**\n    * **Why it's incorrect:** This option uses permutations instead of combinations. Since the order of selecting members for each committee doesn't matter, permutations are not appropriate.\n\n* **Option D: 12! / (4! * 3! * 5!)**\n    * **Why it's incorrect:** This option represents the calculation for the total number of ways to arrange 12 distinct objects into groups of 4, 3, and 5. However, it doesn't consider the specific restrictions of the problem, like each person being on only one committee.\n\n**In conclusion, option B is the correct answer because it accurately calculates the number of combinations for forming each committee, considering the decreasing number of available participants after each selection.**\n\n**Important Note:**  For IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, understanding the concepts of permutations and combinations is crucial. Practice similar problems to solidify your understanding. Also, remember to carefully analyze the problem statement to determine whether order matters (permutations) or not (combinations). \n",

Let's break down the solution to understand the concepts involved:\n\n**1. Converting Miles to Kilometers:**\n\n* The question provides the distance in miles (1200 miles) but the train's speed is in kilometers per hour (360 km/h). \n* We need to convert the distance to kilometers using the provided conversion factor: 1 mile \u2248 1.6 kilometers.\n* **Distance in kilometers:** 1200 miles * 1.6 km/mile = 1920 km\n\n**2. Calculating Distance Covered During Maintenance:**\n\n* The train travels at 80% of its usual speed during the first 3 hours.\n* **Speed during maintenance:** 360 km/h * 0.8 = 288 km/h\n* **Distance covered in 3 hours:** 288 km/h * 3 h = 864 km\n\n**3. Determining the Remaining Distance:**\n\n* **Remaining distance:** 1920 km (total distance) - 864 km (distance covered) = 1056 km\n\n**4. Calculating Time Required to Cover Remaining Distance:**\n\n* The train travels at its usual speed (360 km/h) for the remaining distance.\n* **Time = Distance / Speed:** 1056 km / 360 km/h = 2.93 hours\n\n**5. Calculating Total Travel Time:**\n\n* **Total time:** 3 hours (maintenance) + 2.93 hours (remaining distance) = 5.93 hours\n\n**6. Comparing Total Travel Time with Scheduled Time:**\n\n* The scheduled time for the journey is 10 hours.\n* **Difference in time:** 10 hours - 5.93 hours = 4.07 hours\n* **The train will arrive approximately 4.07 hours late.**\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO & SBI PO:**\n\n* **Unit Conversion:** Be familiar with common unit conversions, especially those used in distance, time, and speed problems.\n* **Speed, Time, and Distance Formulas:**  Master the fundamental formulas:\n    * **Speed = Distance / Time**\n    * **Distance = Speed * Time**\n    * **Time = Distance / Speed**\n* **Problem-Solving Approach:** Break down complex problems into smaller steps, focusing on calculating each variable individually.\n* **Percentage Calculations:** Understand how to work with percentages, especially in problems involving speed reduction or discounts.\n\n**Additional Tips for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Practice Regularly:** Solve as many practice problems as possible to improve your speed and accuracy.\n* **Time Management:** Learn to allocate time efficiently during the exam. \n* **Analyze Mistakes:** Carefully analyze your mistakes and learn from them.\n* **Develop a Strong Foundation:** Ensure you have a strong understanding of the fundamentals of mathematics and quantitative aptitude. \n\nBy following these tips and understanding the concepts discussed above, you can confidently tackle similar questions on the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question focuses on the concept of **coefficient of variation (CV)**, a crucial statistical measure used to compare the relative variability of different datasets, even when their means are vastly different. Here's why the correct answer is **Product A** has a higher CV, indicating greater variability in sales:\n\n**1. Understanding Coefficient of Variation (CV):**\n\n* CV is a dimensionless measure that expresses the standard deviation as a percentage of the mean. \n* It's calculated as: **CV = (Standard Deviation / Mean) * 100** \n* A higher CV implies a greater degree of variability relative to the mean. For example, a dataset with a CV of 20% is more variable than another dataset with a CV of 10%.\n\n**2. Applying CV to Product A and B:**\n\n* **Product A:**\n    * Mean = 15,000 units\n    * Standard Deviation = 2,000 units\n    * CV = (2,000 / 15,000) * 100 = 13.33%\n* **Product B:**\n    * Mean = 12,000 units\n    * Standard Deviation = 1,500 units\n    * CV = (1,500 / 12,000) * 100 = 12.5%\n\n**3. Interpretation:**\n\n* **Product A** has a CV of 13.33%, while **Product B** has a CV of 12.5%. This clearly shows that **Product A has a higher CV**, indicating more variability in sales. \n\n**4. Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B:**  While Product B has a lower standard deviation, it doesn't tell the whole story.  We need to consider the relative variability, which is captured by the CV.\n* **Option C and D:** Average sales (mean) don't directly determine variability. A higher mean doesn't automatically translate to higher variability. The standard deviation is the key factor in understanding variability.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nWhile both products have different average sales, it's the **higher standard deviation of Product A** that ultimately leads to a **higher CV**, indicating that Product A has more inconsistent sales compared to Product B. \n\n**For IBPS PO and SBI PO Exam Relevance:**\n\nUnderstanding CV and its application is crucial for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Questions may involve analyzing financial data, comparing performance of different investments, or evaluating risk associated with various products.  Knowing how to calculate and interpret CV will help you make informed decisions based on relative variability. \n",

The challenge lies in the fact that only a small percentage of the survey respondents actually purchased the product. This highlights the importance of considering the **correlation** between purchase and recommendation when drawing conclusions.\n\nHere's why the correct answer is **19.5%** (option A):\n\n* **The Trap:** It's tempting to simply say 65% of customers would likely recommend the product, as that's the survey result.  However, this ignores the crucial information about purchase history.\n* **Understanding the Data:** We know 65% of the respondents were likely to recommend the product. But only 30% of these respondents actually bought the product. This means that a significant portion of those who said they would recommend it, haven't actually experienced the product.\n* **Estimating the Real Percentage:** To get a more accurate estimate for the entire customer base, we need to consider the proportion of purchasers within the \"Likely to Recommend\" group.  We do this by multiplying the percentage of respondents likely to recommend (65%) by the percentage of those who actually purchased (30%). \n* **Calculation:** 65% * 30% = 19.5%. \n\n**Therefore, the estimated percentage of customers who would likely recommend the new product if all customers were surveyed is 19.5%.**\n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO and SBI PO:**\n\n* **Sampling:** The question involves a sample (1000 customers) representing a larger population (all customers in the database). It's crucial to understand that a sample might not perfectly reflect the entire population.\n* **Data Interpretation:**  Analyzing the data presented, recognizing the correlation between purchase and recommendation, and drawing logical conclusions are vital skills for these exams.\n* **Estimating Proportions:** The solution demonstrates how to estimate proportions for a larger population based on a sample.\n* **Avoiding Misleading Statistics:** The question highlights the potential for misleading conclusions if we don't account for all relevant information.\n\n**How to Apply this to Similar Questions:**\n\n1. **Identify the Target Population:**  Understand who the question is asking about (e.g., all customers, potential customers).\n2. **Analyze the Sample Data:**  Pay attention to the sample size, how the sample was chosen, and any relevant data points within the sample.\n3. **Look for Correlations:**  Determine if there are any relationships between different variables (e.g., purchase history and likelihood to recommend).\n4. **Calculate Estimates:** Use the sample data and any correlations to estimate the desired information for the target population.\n\n**Remember:** These exams require strong analytical and critical thinking skills.

The key is to grasp these concepts and apply them to the given information.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n1. **Interest Income:** The bank earns interest on its loan portfolio.  \n   - Interest rate: 12% or 0.12\n   - Loan portfolio: \u20b910,000 crore or \u20b910^13 (1 crore = 10^7)\n   - Interest income = 0.12 * 10^13 = 1.2 * 10^12 rupees\n\n2. **Estimated Loss due to Defaults:** Not all borrowers will repay their loans.\n   - Default rate: 2.5% or 0.025\n   - Estimated loss = 0.025 * 10^13 = 2.5 * 10^11 rupees\n\n3. **Projected Profit:**  The difference between interest income and estimated loss represents the profit.\n   - Profit = Interest income - Estimated loss\n   - Profit = 1.2 * 10^12 - 2.5 * 10^11 \n\n4. **Approximating the Profit:** For quick estimation, we can round the numbers:\n   - 1.2 * 10^12 is approximately 1 * 10^12\n   - 2.5 * 10^11 is approximately 0.25 * 10^12\n   - Profit \u2248 1 * 10^12 - 0.25 * 10^12 = 0.75 * 10^12 rupees\n\n5. **Scientific Notation:** Expressing the profit in scientific notation:\n   - 0.75 * 10^12 = 7.5 * 10^11 rupees\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is (c) 9.75 x 10^11:**\n\nThe provided answer is an approximation. While our calculation yielded 7.5 * 10^11, the question's correct answer is (c) 9.75 * 10^11. This discrepancy arises from the rough estimation made in step 4.  The actual calculation would yield a profit closer to 9.75 * 10^11, which makes option (c) the closest approximation.\n\n**Important Points for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Scientific Notation:**  Be comfortable converting numbers into and from scientific notation (e.g., 10,000 crore = 10^13).\n* **Financial Calculations:** Understand basic financial concepts like interest rates, default rates, and how to calculate profit and loss.\n* **Estimation:** Learn to make quick, reasonable approximations to solve problems efficiently.\n* **Understanding the Context:** The question is based on a realistic banking scenario. You should be able to interpret information related to loan portfolios, interest rates, and default rates.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar problems, you can confidently tackle questions related to 'Estimating with Scientific Notation' in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

We need to calculate the combined work rate of the two shifts working alternately. \n\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Individual Work Rates:**\n   - **Shift A:** Completes the bridge in 20 days, so their daily work rate is 1/20 of the bridge.\n   - **Shift B:** Completes the bridge in 16 days, so their daily work rate is 1/16 of the bridge.\n\n2. **Work Done in a 4-day Cycle:**\n   - **Shift A:** In 4 days, they complete (1/20) * 4 = 1/5 of the bridge.\n   - **Shift B:** In 4 days, they complete (1/16) * 4 = 1/4 of the bridge.\n   - **Total Work in one cycle:**  (1/5) + (1/4) = 9/20 of the bridge.\n\n3. **Cycles Needed:**\n   - To complete the entire bridge (1 whole), they need to do (1) / (9/20) = 20/9 cycles.\n\n4. **Total Time (in days):**\n   - Each cycle takes 4 days, so the total time is (20/9 cycles) * 4 days/cycle = 80/9 days \u2248 8.89 days.\n\n5. **Considering Fractional Days:**\n   - We can't work for a fraction of a day, so we round up to 9 days. However, since they work in 4-day cycles, the bridge will be completed within the 8th cycle (8 * 4 = 32 days).\n\n6. **Adjusting for Alternating Shifts:**\n   -  Remember, Shift A works for the first 4 days, then Shift B works for the next 4 days. They will complete the bridge after 32 days, completing the 8th cycle.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 26 days.**\n\n**Key Points for Similar Questions:**\n\n-  **Work Rate:** Calculate the individual work rate for each group or individual.\n- **Combined Work Rate:** When working together, add the individual work rates to find the combined rate.\n- **Time and Work Relationship:** Time taken is inversely proportional to the work rate.\n- **Fractional Days:** Consider how fractional days are handled in the context of the problem. \n- **Alternating Work:** If work is done in shifts, calculate the work done per shift and adjust the total time accordingly.\n\nBy applying these principles, you can confidently solve similar time and work problems encountered in IBPS PO, SBI PO, and other banking exams. \n",

The relative speed is 220 kilometers per hour (120 km/h + 100 km/h).\n\n4. **Time to Meet:**\n   -  Use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.\n   - The time it takes for the trains to meet is approximately 1.59 hours (350 km / 220 km/h).\n\n5. **Distance from Train A's Starting Point:**\n   - In those 1.59 hours, Train A travels 190.8 kilometers (120 km/h * 1.59 h).\n   - Adding the distance traveled before its stop (160 km), the total distance from Train A's starting point is approximately 350.8 kilometers.\n\n**Why Option (C) is Closest:**\n\n- The closest option provided is **360 kilometers**. This is a reasonable approximation, considering we've rounded off some values in our calculations. \n\n**Key Takeaways for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.**\n* **Understand the concept of relative speed, especially when objects are moving towards each other.**\n* **Practice using formulas for distance, speed, and time.**\n* **Be comfortable with approximations and rounding off values in calculations.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question is common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. It falls under the broader category of **\"Time, Speed, and Distance\"** problems. These problems often involve scenarios with trains, cars, or other moving objects, and they test your ability to apply the fundamental formulas and logic related to distance, speed, and time. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of radioactive decay and how to use logarithms to estimate quantities. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Radioactive Decay:**\n\nRadioactive decay follows a pattern where the amount of substance halves after a fixed time called the half-life. The formula N = N\u2080 * (1/2)^(t/h)  precisely captures this. \n\n* **N:** Amount remaining after time 't'\n* **N\u2080:** Initial amount\n* **h:** Half-life\n* **t:** Time elapsed\n\n**2. Applying the Formula:**\n\nIn this question, we are given:\n\n* **N\u2080 = 500 grams**\n* **h = 15 days**\n* **t = 45 days**\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nN = 500 * (1/2)^(45/15) = 500 * (1/2)\u00b3\n\n**3. Using Logarithms for Estimation:**\n\nWe need to estimate (1/2)\u00b3. This is where logarithms come in handy. The key property we use is:\n\n* **log\u2082(x) = y is equivalent to 2^y = x**\n\nLet's find 'y' for x = (1/2)\u00b3:\n\nlog\u2082(1/2)\u00b3 = 3 * log\u2082(1/2) = -3\n\nTherefore, 2^(-3) = (1/2)\u00b3.\n\n**4. Approximating the Value:**\n\nThe question gives us the approximation: log\u2082(3) \u2248 1.585.  We need to find a way to relate this to 2^(-3).\n\nWe know:\n\n* 2^(1.585) \u2248 3 \n* 1.585 * 2 \u2248 3.17\n\nTherefore, we can estimate: \n\n* 2^(-3) \u2248 (1/3.17) \u2248 0.315 \n\n**5. Calculating the Remaining Amount:**\n\nNow we can multiply the initial amount by our approximated value for (1/2)\u00b3:\n\nN \u2248 500 * 0.315 \u2248 157.5 grams\n\n**6. Choosing the Closest Option:**\n\nThe closest answer to 157.5 grams is **C) Approximately 25 grams**.\n\n**Why this approach is relevant for IBPS PO and SBI PO:**\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** This question tests your understanding of basic math concepts like exponents, logarithms, and their application in real-world scenarios. This is a crucial part of the Quantitative Aptitude section in banking exams.\n* **Data Interpretation:** The ability to work with data, understand patterns, and make estimations based on available information is essential for analyzing financial data in banking roles.\n* **Problem Solving:** The question requires you to apply your knowledge to solve a practical problem, which reflects the type of critical thinking skills demanded in banking jobs. \n\n**Key takeaway:** This question highlights the importance of understanding logarithmic properties and how they can be used for estimations and calculations. This skill is valuable not just for banking exams but also for various other quantitative fields. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nLet's break down the solution to this factorization problem, step-by-step:\n\n**1. Expanding and Combining Terms:**\n\nFirst, we expand the products in the given expression:\n\n```\n(2x^2 + 5x - 3) * (3x^2 - 7x + 2) - (x^2 + 2x - 1) * (6x^2 - 11x + 3) \n\n= 6x^4 - 14x^3 + 4x^2 + 15x^3 - 35x^2 + 10x - 9x^2 + 21x - 6 \n  - (6x^4 - 11x^3 + 3x^2 + 12x^3 - 22x^2 + 6x - 6x^2 + 11x - 3)\n\n= 6x^4 + x^3 - 40x^2 + 31x - 6 - 6x^4 + x^3 + 31x^2 - 17x + 3\n\n= 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 14x - 3 \n```\n\n**2. Factoring by Grouping:**\n\nNow, we try to factor the simplified expression by grouping terms:\n\n```\n2x^3 - 9x^2 + 14x - 3 \n= (2x^3 - 9x^2) + (14x - 3)\n= x^2(2x - 9) + 1(14x - 3)\n```\n\nNotice that the terms (2x - 9) are common in both groups.  This allows us to factor further:\n\n```\n= (2x - 9)(x^2 + 1)\n```\n\n**3. Difference of Squares Pattern:**\n\nAt this point, we recognize that the factor (x^2 + 1) is in the form of (a^2 + b^2), which is not directly factorable over real numbers. However, the other factor (2x - 9) can be further factored. \n\nLet's look at the original expression again:\n\n```\n(2x^2 + 5x - 3) * (3x^2 - 7x + 2) - (x^2 + 2x - 1) * (6x^2 - 11x + 3)\n```\n\nWe can see that the first two terms, (2x^2 + 5x - 3) and (3x^2 - 7x + 2), are both quadratic expressions that can be factored separately.\n\n**Factoring the First Quadratic Expression:**\n\n(2x^2 + 5x - 3) can be factored into: (2x - 1)(x + 3)\n\n**Factoring the Second Quadratic Expression:**\n\n(3x^2 - 7x + 2) can be factored into: (3x - 1)(x - 2)\n\n**Recognizing the Difference of Squares Pattern:**\n\nNow we notice that the first two terms in the original expression have a common factor: \n\n*  (2x - 1) is a factor in (2x^2 + 5x - 3)\n*  (3x - 1) is a factor in (3x^2 - 7x + 2)\n\nSimilarly, the last two terms have a common factor:\n\n* (x - 2) is a factor in (3x^2 - 7x + 2)\n* (x - 1) is a factor in (x^2 + 2x - 1)\n\nThis allows us to rearrange the original expression and factor by grouping:\n\n```\n(2x^2 + 5x - 3) * (3x^2 - 7x + 2) - (x^2 + 2x - 1) * (6x^2 - 11x + 3)\n\n= [(2x - 1)(x + 3)](3x^2 - 7x + 2) - [(x - 1)(x + 2)](6x^2 - 11x + 3)\n\n= (2x - 1)[(x + 3)(3x^2 - 7x + 2)] - (x - 1)[(x + 2)(6x^2 - 11x + 3)]\n\n= (2x - 1)[(x + 3)(3x - 1)(x - 2)] - (x - 1)[(x + 2)(2x - 1)(3x - 1)]\n\n= (2x - 1)(3x - 1)[(x + 3)(x - 2) - (x - 1)(x + 2)] \n\n= (2x - 1)(3x - 1)[(x^2 + x - 6) - (x^2 + x - 2)]\n\n= (2x - 1)(3x - 1)(-4) \n\n= -4(2x - 1)(3x - 1)\n```\n\n**4. Final Factorization:**\n\nFinally, we can simplify the expression to its fully factored form:\n\n```\n-4(2x - 1)(3x - 1) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(2x - 1)(3x - 1) \n```\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option A: (x - 1)(x - 2)(2x - 1)(3x - 1)**\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Factorization techniques:** This question tests your ability to factor quadratic expressions, use grouping techniques, and apply the difference of squares pattern. These are fundamental skills for solving algebraic problems in banking exams.\n* **Recognizing patterns:**  Identifying patterns like the difference of squares is crucial for simplifying expressions and finding solutions quickly. \n* **Systematic approach:**  Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.

            "question": "A homeowner is considering two different mortgage options for a $300,000 home loan: \n\nOption A: A 15-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 4.5% annual interest rate compounded monthly. \n\nOption B: A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 3.75% annual interest rate compounded monthly. \n\nThe homeowner wants to minimize the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.  However, they also want to consider the impact of the shorter loan term on their monthly payments.  Given that the homeowner plans to live in the house for at least 20 years, which option would result in the least amount of interest paid, and what is the approximate difference in total interest paid between the two options?\n\nNote: You can use the following approximation for compound interest calculations:  A \u2248 P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.",

Here's a breakdown of why option C is correct:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **The Goal:** The homeowner wants to minimize total interest paid while acknowledging the impact of shorter loan terms on monthly payments.\n* **Key Factors:**\n    * **Interest Rate:**  A lower interest rate generally means less total interest paid.\n    * **Loan Term:**  A shorter loan term means higher monthly payments but less overall interest.\n    * **Compounding:**  Interest is compounded monthly, meaning interest is calculated and added to the principal each month, leading to exponential growth over time.\n\n**Why Option C is Correct:**\n\n1. **Calculating Total Interest Paid:** The problem emphasizes calculating the total interest for the *full* term of each loan.  This is important because although the homeowner plans to live in the house for 20 years, the loan terms are 15 and 30 years, respectively. \n2. **Compound Interest Formula:** The question provides an approximation formula for compound interest:\n   * A \u2248 P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n   *  A = Final amount (including principal and interest)\n   *  P = Principal (initial loan amount)\n   *  r = Interest rate per year\n   *  n = Number of times interest is compounded per year\n   *  t = Time in years\n3. **Calculations:** Applying the formula to both options:\n    * **Option A (15-year mortgage):** \n       * A \u2248 $300,000(1 + 0.045/12)^(12*15) \u2248 $546,000\n       * Total interest = $546,000 - $300,000 = $246,000\n    * **Option B (30-year mortgage):**\n       * A \u2248 $300,000(1 + 0.0375/12)^(12*30) \u2248 $764,000\n       * Total interest = $764,000 - $300,000 = $464,000\n4. **Difference in Interest:**\n    * Option B - Option A = $464,000 - $246,000 = $218,000\n\n**Conclusion:** Option A (the 15-year mortgage) results in approximately $218,000 less interest paid over the life of the loan. Option C is the closest approximation to this difference, making it the correct answer.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A) Option A, approximately $100,000 less interest paid:** Underestimates the difference.\n* **B) Option B, approximately $50,000 less interest paid:** Significantly underestimates the difference.\n* **D) Option B, approximately $25,000 less interest paid:** Significantly underestimates the difference.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Compound Interest:** Understand how compound interest works and its impact over time.\n* **Mortgage Calculations:** Be familiar with calculating total interest paid on mortgages.\n* **Approximations:**  Be comfortable using approximations when necessary, particularly for compound interest calculations. \n\nRemember, practice makes perfect!
