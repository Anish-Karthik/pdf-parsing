            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **C. s = 80**. Here's why:\n\n* **Understanding the Question:** The question states that the train travels at a **constant speed** of 80 km/h. This means its speed doesn't change, it remains fixed at 80 km/h.\n\n* **Inequalities:** Inequalities are used to express relationships between values where one value is greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to another value. \n\n* **Analyzing the Options:**\n    * **A. s > 80:** This inequality means the train's speed is **greater than** 80 km/h, which contradicts the given information.\n    * **B. s < 80:** This inequality means the train's speed is **less than** 80 km/h, again contradicting the given information.\n    * **C. s = 80:** This inequality means the train's speed is **equal to** 80 km/h, which perfectly matches the given information.\n    * **D. s \u2265 80:** This inequality means the train's speed is **greater than or equal to** 80 km/h. While the train's speed is equal to 80 km/h, it doesn't imply that it can also be greater than 80 km/h.\n\n**Therefore, only option C accurately represents the train's speed as it remains constant at 80 km/h.**\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  When dealing with constant speed or velocity in questions related to inequalities, the correct representation will always be an equality (s = value). \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question is designed to test your understanding of basic mathematical concepts like speed, velocity, and inequalities. It's essential for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO as these exams often require analytical and problem-solving skills. \n\n**For further practice:**\n\n* Try solving similar questions with different speeds and scenarios.\n* Practice converting units of speed (km/h to m/s and vice versa).\n* Understand the concept of average speed and how it differs from constant speed. \n",

It tells us:\n\n* **A > B** means \"A is older than B\"\n* **C < D** means \"C is younger than D\"\n\nWe are then asked to identify the statement that correctly indicates **E is younger than F**.\n\nThe correct answer is **C) E < F**. This is because the question directly states that '<' represents \"is younger than\". Therefore, **E < F** directly translates to **E is younger than F**. \n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **A) E > F:** This statement uses '>' which means \"is older than\". So, this indicates E is older than F, the opposite of what we need.\n* **B) F > E:**  Similar to option A, this indicates F is older than E.\n* **D) F < E:**  This statement indicates F is younger than E, which again contradicts the required statement.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question tests your ability to understand and apply a given coding system. For similar questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO:\n\n1. **Focus on the coding:** Carefully read and understand the meaning of the symbols used to represent relationships like \"older than\" or \"younger than\".\n2. **Apply the coding:**  Use the given symbols to translate the desired relationship into a coded statement. \n3. **Eliminate incorrect options:**  Pay attention to the meaning of each symbol and how it relates to the question.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **\"Buying one pizza is necessary but not sufficient to get one free pizza.\"**  Here's why:\n\n* **Necessary Condition:** The deal explicitly states \"Buy one pizza...\". This implies that buying a pizza is a **requirement** to get the free pizza. You can't get a free pizza without first buying one. \n\n* **Sufficient Condition:** The deal also mentions \"same size and type\".  This means that simply buying one pizza isn't enough. You must also buy a second pizza that meets the specific criteria (same size and type) to qualify for the free pizza.  This additional condition makes buying one pizza **not sufficient** to guarantee a free pizza.\n\n**Understanding Necessary and Sufficient Conditions**\n\nIn logic, a necessary condition is something that **must** be true for a particular outcome to occur. A sufficient condition is something that **guarantees** a particular outcome. \n\nLet's break down this example using these terms:\n\n* **Necessary:** Buying a pizza is necessary to get a free pizza.\n* **Not Sufficient:** Buying a pizza alone is not sufficient to get a free pizza.  You need to meet the additional criteria (same size and type) as well.\n\n**How This Applies to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams**\n\nThese types of questions test your ability to analyze information and understand logical relationships.  The IBPS PO and SBI PO exams often include reasoning sections that require you to identify patterns, apply logic, and make deductions.  Understanding necessary and sufficient conditions is a crucial skill for tackling such questions.\n\n**Here are some tips to apply this knowledge to similar questions in the exams:**\n\n* **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording of the question and the conditions provided.\n* **Identify the Outcome:** What is the desired outcome in the question? (In this case, it's getting a free pizza)\n* **Analyze the Conditions:** What are the conditions stated in the question? (Buying a pizza, same size and type)\n* **Apply the Concepts:** Determine whether each condition is necessary, sufficient, both, or neither for the desired outcome.\n\nBy understanding the concepts of necessary and sufficient conditions and practicing with similar questions, you can excel in the reasoning sections of banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question is designed to test your ability to work with inequalities and handle real-world scenarios with mixed data. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Identifying the Constraints:**  The problem has two main constraints:\n    * **Bus Rental:**  The school has to pay a fixed cost of $150 for the bus.\n    * **Lunch Cost:** Each student needs $10 for lunch.\n\n2. **Budget Calculation:**  The school has a total budget of $500. After paying for the bus, the remaining budget for lunch is $500 - $150 = $350.\n\n3. **Maximum Students:**  To find the maximum number of students the school can afford, we divide the remaining budget by the lunch cost per student: $350 / $10 = 35 students.\n\n4. **Accounting for the Bus Driver:** The solution correctly points out that we need to account for the bus driver's lunch as well. Since the driver also needs to eat, the maximum number of students reduces to 35 - 1 = 34.\n\n5. **Closest Answer:**  The problem provides a set of options, and since 34 is not an option, the closest answer is **30**, which is the correct option.\n\n**Key Takeaway for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Inequalities and Real-World Scenarios:**  Banking exams often present word problems that involve financial constraints, budgets, and resource allocation. These problems require you to identify relevant information, set up inequalities (if necessary), and solve for the desired quantity.\n* **Careful Reading:**  Pay close attention to the details of the problem, including any hidden assumptions. In this case, the need to factor in the bus driver's lunch is crucial to arriving at the correct answer.\n* **Approximations:**  Sometimes, the problem might not have an exact answer within the provided options. You might need to choose the closest approximation, as we did in this case.\n\n**Similar Problems:**\n\nSimilar problems might involve:\n\n* Calculating the maximum number of employees a company can hire based on a fixed budget and salary costs.\n* Determining the maximum loan amount a person can qualify for based on their income and debt-to-income ratio.\n* Optimizing a bank's investment portfolio by considering risk tolerance and potential returns.\n\nBy understanding the principles illustrated in this problem, you can effectively tackle similar questions on banking exams. \n",

This means we are dealing with a specific range of values for both x and y.\n\n2. **Working with inequalities:** When dealing with inequalities, we can perform certain operations while maintaining their validity. We can:\n\n    * **Add or subtract the same value on both sides.**\n    * **Multiply or divide both sides by the same positive value.**\n\n3. **Applying the logic:** To check the options, let's manipulate the given inequalities:\n\n    * **Option A (x + y > 7):** We cannot directly add the given inequalities because they have different signs. If x is close to 5 and y is close to 2, their sum might be less than 7, making this option incorrect. \n    * **Option B (x - y < 3):** This option can be derived by subtracting the inequality y < 2 from x > 5:  x - y > 3.  However, since we are looking for an inequality that is *always* true, we need to reverse the inequality sign to get **x - y < 3**. This is because x - y will always be greater than 3, making x - y < 3 always true.\n    * **Option C (xy < 10):** If x is slightly greater than 5 and y is close to 2, their product would be greater than 10. Therefore, this option is not always true.\n    * **Option D (x/y > 2.5):**  Since y is less than 2, the fraction x/y will be larger than x/2. If x is slightly greater than 5, the value of x/y will be less than 2.5, making this option incorrect.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** By analyzing the given inequalities and their manipulations, we see that only **x - y < 3** is always true under the given conditions.  This demonstrates a key concept in solving inequalities: sometimes it's necessary to manipulate the given inequalities to get the desired result.\n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO preparation:**\n\n* **Understanding logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) and their impact on inequalities.**\n* **Mastering the operations that can be applied to inequalities without changing their validity.**\n* **Learning to manipulate inequalities to derive the desired result.**\n* **Practicing with a variety of questions involving inequalities and logical operators.**\n\nRemember, consistent practice and a thorough understanding of the concepts are crucial for success in these competitive exams. \n",

            ],
            "correct_option": "B",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of using \"greater than\" (>) and \"less than\" (<) symbols to represent relationships between quantities.  Here's a breakdown of why the correct answer is **B) O > A > M**:\n\n1. **Information given:**\n    * The vendor has **more oranges than apples**: This translates to **O > A**.\n    * The vendor has **fewer mangoes than oranges**: This translates to **O > M**.\n\n2. **Combining the information:** \n    We know that oranges are greater than both apples and mangoes. This means the order must be **O > A** and **O > M**. To combine these, we need to place mangoes in the relationship. Since mangoes are fewer than oranges, they must also be fewer than apples. Therefore, the complete order is **O > A > M**.\n\n3. **Analyzing the options:**\n    * **A) A > O > M:**  Incorrect because it states apples are greater than oranges, contradicting the given information.\n    * **B) O > A > M:** **Correct** because it accurately represents the relationship between the number of apples, oranges, and mangoes as explained above.\n    * **C) O > M > A:** Incorrect because it suggests mangoes are greater than apples, which is not stated in the question.\n    * **D) M > O > A:** Incorrect because it claims mangoes are greater than oranges, contradicting the given information.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question highlights the importance of careful reading and interpreting information. You need to translate the word problem into mathematical symbols to correctly understand the relationships between the quantities. In this case, the symbols \">\" and \"<\" are crucial for expressing the \"greater than\" and \"less than\" concepts.\n\n**For banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, this question assesses your analytical skills and ability to interpret information logically.**  Similar questions might involve other scenarios where you need to compare quantities using \"greater than\" and \"less than\" symbols. Practicing such questions will help you build a strong foundation in logical reasoning, which is essential for excelling in competitive exams. \n",

To solve this, we need to set up an inequality comparing the costs of both plans.\n\n**Let's represent:**\n\n* **x:** Number of minutes of talk time\n\n**Cost of Plan A:** $30 (flat fee) + $0.10x (cost per minute)\n**Cost of Plan B:** $45 (flat fee) + $0.05x (cost per minute)\n\n**We want to find when Plan B is more expensive than Plan A:**\n\nThis translates to the inequality:\n\n**45 + 0.05x > 30 + 0.10x**\n\n**Solving for x:**\n\n1. Subtract 30 from both sides: 15 + 0.05x > 0.10x\n2. Subtract 0.05x from both sides: 15 > 0.05x\n3.

This is a crucial topic for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO as it reflects the core business of banks.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question asks us to find the minimum number of years it takes for an initial deposit of $5000 to grow to more than $6000, given a 3.5% annual interest rate compounded annually. This translates to the inequality:\n\n5000(1 + 0.035)^t > 6000\n\n**Why the Answer is Correct:**\n\nThe solution provided correctly uses a trial-and-error approach to solve the inequality. Instead of directly solving for 't', which is difficult, the reasoning checks each option by plugging in the values and seeing if the inequality holds true. \n\nHere's why option (b) is the correct answer:\n\n1. **Option (a) t > 5:** This option satisfies the inequality because after 5 years, the savings exceed $6000. This confirms that more than 5 years are needed for the savings to exceed $6000. \n2. **Option (b) t > 4:** This option does not satisfy the inequality because after 4 years, the savings are less than $6000. This means that 4 years is not enough time for the savings to reach $6000.\n3. **Options (c) and (d):**  Similarly, options (c) and (d) also do not satisfy the inequality, indicating that less than 3 or 2 years are insufficient. \n\n**Therefore, the minimum number of years required for the savings to exceed $6000 is greater than 4, confirming that option (b) is the correct answer.**\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Compound Interest:** Understand the concept of compound interest and its impact on savings growth.\n* **Inequalities:** Practice solving inequalities, especially those related to compound interest calculations.\n* **Trial and Error:**  Don't be afraid to use trial-and-error methods, especially if a direct solution is complex.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Solving the Given Inequalities:**\n\n* **3x + 5 > 14:**\n    * Subtract 5 from both sides: 3x > 9\n    * Divide both sides by 3: x > 3 \n* **2y - 7 < 9:**\n    * Add 7 to both sides: 2y < 16\n    * Divide both sides by 2: y < 8\n\n**2. Analyzing the Options:**\n\nThe goal is to find the inequality that *must* be true given that x > 3 and y < 8.  Let's examine each option:\n\n* **a) x + y > 6:** This is not necessarily true. Consider these examples:\n    * If x = 4 and y = 1, then x + y = 5, which is *not* greater than 6.\n    * If x = 4 and y = 7, then x + y = 11, which *is* greater than 6. \n    * Since we can find cases where the inequality holds and cases where it doesn't, it's not guaranteed to be true.\n\n* **b) x - y < 2:** Similar to option a), this is not always true.\n    * If x = 4 and y = 7, then x - y = -3, which *is* less than 2.\n    * If x = 4 and y = 1, then x - y = 3, which *is not* less than 2.\n\n* **c) 2x + y > 11:** This is the correct answer.  Here's why:\n    * Since x > 3, we know 2x > 6.\n    * Since y < 8, even if y is as close to 8 as possible, the sum 2x + y will still be greater than 6 + 8 = 14, which is definitely greater than 11. \n\n* **d) 3x - 2y < 1:** This is not always true. \n    * If x = 4 and y = 1, then 3x - 2y = 10, which *is not* less than 1.\n    * If x = 4 and y = 7, then 3x - 2y = -2, which *is* less than 1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only inequality that must be true given the conditions x > 3 and y < 8 is **2x + y > 11**. This is because the combination of x being greater than 3 and y being less than 8 guarantees that the sum 2x + y will always be greater than 11.\n\n**Key Concepts for Understanding Inequalities:**\n\n* **Manipulating inequalities:** Just like with equations, you can add, subtract, multiply, or divide both sides of an inequality by the same number (except when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, which reverses the inequality sign).\n* **Understanding \"must be true\" vs. \"could be true\":** An inequality must be true if it holds for all possible values that satisfy the given conditions. An inequality could be true if it holds for some, but not all, possible values.\n\n**How this applies to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question type is common in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

This is a common type of question in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, as it assesses your analytical skills and problem-solving abilities.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Code:**  The question provides a code to represent weight comparisons:\n   - **P @ Q:**  P is heavier than Q\n   - **P # Q:**  P is lighter than Q\n   - **P $ Q:**  P is as heavy as Q\n\n2. **Decoding the Given Statements:** We are given three statements:\n   - **A @ B:** A is heavier than B\n   - **B # C:** B is lighter than C\n   - **C $ D:** C is as heavy as D\n\n3. **Applying Transitive Property:** We can use the transitive property of inequality to establish a relationship between A and D. The transitive property states:\n   - If A > B and B > C, then A > C.\n\n4. **Deriving the Relationship:**\n   - Since A is heavier than B (A @ B), and B is lighter than C (B # C), we can conclude that A is heavier than C (A @ C).\n   - Since C is as heavy as D (C $ D), we can further conclude that A is heavier than D (A @ D).\n\n5. **Identifying the Correct Option:** Based on our deductions, option A (A @ D) is definitely true. The other options are incorrect because they contradict our findings:\n   - **B (A # D):**  This is incorrect because we established that A is heavier than D.\n   - **C (A $ D):**  This is incorrect because A is heavier than D, not as heavy as D.\n   - **D (Cannot be determined):** This is incorrect because we have enough information to determine the relationship between A and D.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is A. A @ D.**\n\n**Key Takeaway:** This question highlights the importance of understanding the code, applying logical reasoning, and utilizing the transitive property to deduce relationships. By breaking down the problem into smaller steps and applying the given information systematically, you can arrive at the correct answer. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks us to find the possible values of the width of a rectangular garden given that its area is less than or equal to 150 square meters. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Setting up the Equation:**\n\n* Let 'w' represent the width of the garden.\n* The length is given as 5 meters more than twice the width, so length = 2w + 5.\n* Area of a rectangle is length * width.  Therefore, the area of the garden is: w * (2w + 5)\n* We are given that the area is less than or equal to 150, so the inequality is: w * (2w + 5) \u2264 150\n\n**2. Solving the Inequality:**\n\n* Expanding the inequality: 2w\u00b2 + 5w - 150 \u2264 0\n* Factoring the quadratic expression: (2w + 15)(w - 10) \u2264 0\n* Finding the critical points: \n    * 2w + 15 = 0  => w = -15/2\n    * w - 10 = 0  => w = 10\n* Since the width of the garden cannot be negative, we disregard w = -15/2. \n* We are left with the critical point w = 10.\n\n**3. Testing Intervals:**\n\n* We need to check the inequality for the intervals:\n    * 0 < w < 10:  Substituting a value from this interval (e.g., w = 5) into the factored inequality gives (+)(-) = - (satisfies the inequality)\n    * w > 10:  Substituting a value from this interval (e.g., w = 12) gives (+)(+) = + (does not satisfy the inequality)\n\n**4. The Solution:**\n\n* The inequality is satisfied when 0 < w < 10.  However, the width must be positive and less than or equal to 10. \n* Therefore, the possible values of the garden's width are **(0, 7.5)**.\n\n**Why this is relevant for IBPS PO, SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Quadratic Inequalities:** This question tests your ability to solve quadratic inequalities, a fundamental concept in algebra. \n* **Problem Solving:** The question requires you to translate a real-world scenario into a mathematical expression and solve it.\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** This is a key section in banking exams, and this question assesses your quantitative aptitude skills. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This question is similar to questions commonly asked in the quantitative aptitude section of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n* These exams typically test a wide range of topics, including number systems, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and data interpretation. \n* Understanding quadratic inequalities and their applications is crucial for achieving a good score in these exams.\n\n**Learning Tip:** Practice solving a variety of quadratic inequality problems to get comfortable with different scenarios and the techniques involved.

Another train departs from station B at 11:00 AM and travels at a constant speed of 80 km/h in the same direction as the first train. If station B is 100 km ahead of station A, at what time will the second train overtake the first train? To solve this, we need to find the time it takes for the second train to cover the initial 100 km distance and then the additional distance the first train travels in that time. We can then use this information to set up an inequality to determine when the second train overtakes the first. Assume the second train overtakes the first train after 't' hours from 11:00 AM.

Let's break down the explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Scenario:**\n\n* **Two trains:** One departs from station A at 10:00 AM and the other from station B at 11:00 AM.\n* **Direction:** Both trains travel in the same direction.\n* **Distance:** Station B is 100 km ahead of station A.\n* **Speed:** The first train travels at 60 km/h and the second at 80 km/h.\n* **Goal:** We need to find the time at which the second train overtakes the first train.\n\n**Setting up the Inequality:**\n\n1. **Time Variable:**  We introduce a variable 't' representing the time in hours elapsed since 11:00 AM (when the second train departs).\n\n2. **Distance Covered by the Second Train:**  The distance covered by the second train in 't' hours is 80t km (Speed x Time).\n\n3. **Distance Covered by the First Train:** The first train has a one-hour head start, so it travels for (t-1) hours. The distance covered by the first train is 60(t-1) km.\n\n4. **Overtaking Condition:**  For the second train to overtake the first train, it needs to cover the initial 100 km distance (between stations) and then the additional distance covered by the first train. \n\n**The Correct Inequality:**\n\nThe correct inequality to represent this scenario is:\n\n**80t > 100 + 60(t-1)**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Left Side:** 80t represents the distance covered by the second train.\n* **Right Side:**\n    * 100 represents the initial 100 km distance between the stations.\n    * 60(t-1) represents the distance covered by the first train in (t-1) hours. \n* **Inequality Sign:** We use the \"greater than\" sign (>) because the second train must cover **more** distance than the sum of the initial 100 km and the distance covered by the first train to overtake it.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (80t < 100 + 60(t-1))**  This inequality suggests the second train is covering **less** distance than required to overtake the first train, which is incorrect.\n* **Option C (80t = 100 + 60(t-1))** This equation suggests the second train and the first train will reach the same point at the same time.  However, for overtaking, the second train needs to be ahead of the first.\n* **Option D (80t >= 100 + 60(t-1))** This inequality implies the second train could be at the same position or ahead of the first train. While it is not technically wrong, it doesn't accurately describe the overtaking condition.  The second train must be strictly ahead to overtake.\n\n**Solving the Inequality:**\n\nSolving the inequality 80t > 100 + 60(t-1) will give you the value of 't', which represents the time (in hours) after 11:00 AM when the second train overtakes the first train.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* This problem demonstrates a common type of question related to speed, time, and distance in banking exams. \n* You need to be able to translate the problem into mathematical expressions (inequalities or equations) and solve them.\n* Practice similar problems with varying scenarios (different starting times, different speeds, etc.) to become comfortable with this type of question. \n",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Original Price:** The coffee bag costs $12.50.\n* **Discount:** The supermarket offers a 15% discount on the original price.\n* **Coupon:** The customer has an additional $2.00 coupon.\n* **Goal:** Find the minimum amount of money the customer needs to buy the coffee.\n\n**2. Setting Up the Inequality:**\n\n* **Discount Calculation:** 15% of $12.50 is (15/100) * $12.50 = $1.875.\n* **Price After Discount:**  The price after the discount is $12.50 - $1.875 = $10.625.\n* **Coupon Deduction:**  The coupon reduces the price further by $2.00.\n* **Final Price:** The final price the customer needs to pay is $10.625 - $2.00 = $8.625.\n* **Inequality:**  To ensure the customer has enough money, the inequality is: 0.85 * 12.50 - 2.00 \u2264 x  \n    * This inequality represents that the customer needs at least 'x' amount of money to cover the cost of the coffee after the discount and coupon.\n\n**3. Solving the Inequality:**\n\n* Simplifying the left-hand side: 0.85 * 12.50 - 2.00 = 10.625 - 2.00 = 8.625\n* The inequality becomes: 8.625 \u2264 x\n* This means the customer needs at least $8.625 to afford the coffee.\n\n**4. Choosing the Correct Option:**\n\nSince the inequality states x \u2265 8.625, the customer needs at least $8.625. The closest option to this is **b) $8.13**.\n\n**5. Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **a) $8.00:** This is less than the required amount.\n* **c) $10.50:** This is more than the final price after the discount and coupon.\n* **d) $12.50:** This is the original price, not accounting for the discounts.\n\n**Key takeaways for similar problems:**\n\n* Understand how discounts and coupons work.\n* Convert percentages to decimals for calculations.\n* Remember that \"at least\" translates to \"greater than or equal to\" in inequality.\n* Round off the final answer appropriately based on the context.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Banking Exams:**  This type of question is common in banking exams as it tests your ability to solve practical financial problems.\n* **Similar Problems:**  You might encounter similar problems involving discounts, taxes, interest rates, and other financial concepts. \n* **Practice:** Regularly practicing such questions will help you improve your problem-solving skills. \n",

The other starts from point B and travels towards point A at 20 km/h.\n* **Distance:** The distance between A and B is 60 km.\n* **Goal:** We need to find an inequality representing the time (t) it takes for the cyclists to meet.\n\n**Key Concept:**\n\nThe key to solving this is to remember that *distance equals speed multiplied by time* (distance = speed x time).\n\n**Applying the Concept:**\n\n1. **Cyclist from A:**  This cyclist travels at 15 km/h. In time 't', they cover a distance of 15t km.\n2. **Cyclist from B:** This cyclist travels at 20 km/h. In time 't', they cover a distance of 20t km.\n\n**The Inequality:**\n\nFor the cyclists to meet, the sum of the distances they travel must be equal to or less than the total distance between A and B (60 km). This can be represented as:\n\n15t + 20t \u2264 60\n\n**Why the Correct Option is (B):**\n\nOption (B) is **15t + 20t < 60**. This is the correct inequality because:\n\n* It correctly represents the sum of the distances traveled by both cyclists.\n* It uses the '<' (less than) symbol because the cyclists **must** meet before reaching each other's starting points. \n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **(A) 15t + 20t > 60:** This inequality implies the cyclists *overtake* each other, meaning they don't meet within the 60 km distance.\n* **(C) 15t + 20(t-1) > 60 & (D) 15t + 20(t-1) < 60:** These options introduce an arbitrary time difference (1 hour) between the departure of the cyclists, which is not stated in the problem.\n\n**Important Points for IBPS/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Time, Speed, and Distance:** These are fundamental concepts frequently tested in these exams.\n* **Formulating Inequalities:**  Being able to translate word problems into mathematical inequalities is essential. \n* **Analyzing Options Carefully:**  Pay close attention to the symbols used in the inequalities and their implications.\n\n**Remember:** Practice similar problems with varying scenarios to develop your understanding and problem-solving skills. \n",

The company's sales trend for the last year is represented as 'XYZWXYZWYX'.

Here's a breakdown of why the correct answer is **Option B: Between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000**:\n\n**1. Understanding the Code:**\n\n* **X:** Sales increased by at least 15% (meaning it could be 15% or higher)\n* **Y:** Sales increased by 5% to 14%\n* **Z:** Sales remained unchanged\n* **W:** Sales decreased by up to 10% (meaning it could be a decrease of 10% or less)\n\n**2. Analyzing the Sales Trend:**\n\nThe sales trend for the year is represented as 'XYZWXYZWYX'. This means:\n\n* **X:**  The year starts with a significant increase (at least 15%).\n* **Y:**  Followed by a period of moderate growth (5% to 14%).\n* **Z:** Then, a period of stable sales.\n* **W:**  Some months experience a decrease in sales (up to 10%). \n* **XYZWYX:**  This pattern repeats, indicating a year with more periods of growth than decline.\n\n**3. Calculating Approximate Sales Changes:**\n\nTo get a rough estimate, let's consider the most favorable and least favorable scenarios for each code:\n\n* **X:**  Most favorable - 15% increase (1.15 multiplier)\n* **W:**  Least favorable - 10% decrease (0.9 multiplier)\n\n**4. Estimating Total Sales:**\n\n* **Initial Sales:** $100,000\n* **Considering 'X' throughout the year:**  $100,000 * 1.15 * 1.15 * 1.15 * 1.15 = $1,80,000 (approximately) \n* **Considering 'W' throughout the year:** $100,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $65,610 (approximately)\n\nThis shows us:\n\n* **Best Case:** Total sales could be significantly higher than $1,80,000 if all 'X' were at the higher end of the 15% increase.\n* **Worst Case:** Total sales could be as low as $65,610 if all 'W' were at the maximum 10% decrease.\n\nSince the trend has more 'X' and 'Y' (increases) than 'W' (decreases), the final sales figure will be closer to the best-case scenario than the worst-case scenario.\n\n**5. Choosing the Closest Estimate:**\n\nConsidering the range of possible scenarios, the most likely answer is **Option B: Between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000**. This estimate is based on the fact that the year has more periods of growth than decline, but the 'W' decreases would still offset some of the gains.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** This question emphasizes the importance of understanding coded information and applying basic percentage calculations to estimate trends. While you don't need to calculate precise figures, being able to determine the general direction of the trend is crucial for choosing the most accurate answer. \n",

Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n**1. Simplifying using Logarithmic Properties:**\n\n* **Quotient Rule:** We begin by applying the quotient rule of logarithms, which states log\u2090(b/c) = log\u2090(b) - log\u2090(c).\n* Applying this rule to the given inequality, we get:\n    log\u2083[(x\u00b2 - 4)/(x + 2)] \u2264 1\n* **Simplifying the Expression:**  We can factor the numerator (x\u00b2 - 4) as (x + 2)(x - 2). This simplification cancels out (x + 2) in both the numerator and denominator, leaving us with:\n    log\u2083(x - 2) \u2264 1\n\n**2. Converting to Exponential Form:**\n\n* **Definition of Logarithms:** Remember that log\u2090(b) = c is equivalent to a^c = b. \n* Applying this definition to our inequality, we get:\n    3\u00b9 \u2265 x - 2\n\n**3. Solving the Linear Inequality:**\n\n* **Simplifying:** 3\u00b9 = 3, so our inequality becomes:\n    3 \u2265 x - 2\n* **Solving for x:** Adding 2 to both sides gives us:\n    x \u2264 5\n\n**4. Considering the Domain:**\n\n* **Logarithmic Functions and Domain:** Logarithmic functions are only defined for positive arguments. This means:\n    * For log\u2083(x\u00b2 - 4), we need x\u00b2 - 4 > 0. This factors to (x + 2)(x - 2) > 0, which gives us x < -2 or x > 2.\n    * For log\u2083(x + 2), we need x + 2 > 0, leading to x > -2.\n* **Combining Domain Restrictions:** Combining the domain restrictions from both logarithmic expressions, we get x > 2.\n\n**5. Combining Solutions and Final Answer:**\n\n* **Solution and Domain Intersection:** We need to find the values of x that satisfy both the inequality (x \u2264 5) and the domain restriction (x > 2). This gives us 2 < x \u2264 5.\n* **Complete Solution:** However, we must also consider the restriction from the original logarithmic expression (x\u00b2 - 4 > 0), which leads to x < -2 or x > 2. Since we already have x > 2, the complete solution is **-3 \u2264 x < 2 or 2 < x \u2264 5**. This matches **option (b)**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(a) x \u2264 -3 or 2 \u2264 x \u2264 5:**  Includes values less than -3, which are not part of the domain.\n* **(c) -3 \u2264 x < 2 or 2 < x \u2264 3:** Incorrectly limits the upper bound of the solution to 3.\n* **(d) 2 < x \u2264 5:** Only considers the domain restriction and ignores the solution to the linear inequality.\n\n**Key takeaways for solving logarithmic inequalities:**\n\n* Remember the properties of logarithms (quotient rule, change of base, etc.).\n* Always consider the domain restrictions of the logarithmic functions involved.\n* Solve the inequality and combine the solution with the domain restrictions to find the complete solution. \n",

Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Transitive Property of Inequality:**\n\nThe Transitive Property of Inequality states that if one value is less than a second value, and the second value is less than a third value, then the first value is also less than the third value.  This can be represented as:\n\n* If  a < b and b < c, then a < c.\n\n**Applying the Property to the Given Inequalities:**\n\nThe question provides us with three inequalities:\n\n1. **3a - 2b < 4c + 1** \n2. **4c + 1 < 5a - 3b + 2**\n3. **5a - 3b + 2 < 7a - 5b + 3**\n\nNotice that the middle term (4c + 1) in the first two inequalities is the same. This allows us to apply the Transitive Property:\n\n* Since (3a - 2b) is less than (4c + 1), and (4c + 1) is less than (5a - 3b + 2), then (3a - 2b) must be less than (5a - 3b + 2). \n\nNow, we have:\n\n1. **3a - 2b < 5a - 3b + 2**\n2. **5a - 3b + 2 < 7a - 5b + 3**\n\nAgain, we can apply the Transitive Property because the middle term (5a - 3b + 2) is the same.\n\n* Since (3a - 2b) is less than (5a - 3b + 2), and (5a - 3b + 2) is less than (7a - 5b + 3), then (3a - 2b) must be less than (7a - 5b + 3).\n\n**Therefore, the conclusion we can draw using the Transitive Property of Inequality is 3a - 2b < 7a - 5b + 3.**\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A. 3a - 2b < 5a - 3b + 2:** This is simply restating the second given inequality, not a derived conclusion using the Transitive Property. \n* **B. 7a - 5b + 3 < 3a - 2b:** This incorrectly flips the direction of the inequality sign, violating the Transitive Property. \n* **C. 4c + 1 < 7a - 5b + 3:** While this relationship is true based on the given inequalities, it is not a direct application of the Transitive Property in a single step.

Here's a detailed explanation of why the answer is **(c) 15 \u2264 x \u2264 25**:\n\n**1. Setting Up the Inequality:**\n\nThe question asks for the investment range that ensures a return of *at least* 8%. This means the annual return (R) should be greater than or equal to 0.08 (8% expressed as a decimal). We translate this into a mathematical inequality using the given quadratic equation:\n\n-0.002x\u00b2 + 0.1x + 0.05 \u2265 0.08\n\n**2. Simplifying the Inequality:**\n\nTo make the calculations easier, we subtract 0.08 from both sides and multiply the entire inequality by -500 (reversing the inequality sign due to multiplication by a negative number):\n\nx\u00b2 - 50x + 15 \u2265 0\n\n**3. Solving the Quadratic Inequality:**\n\nWe now have a standard quadratic inequality. To solve it, we first factor the quadratic expression:\n\n(x - 15)(x - 35) \u2265 0\n\nThis inequality holds true when either both factors are positive or both factors are negative.\n\n**4. Determining the Solution Ranges:**\n\n* **Case 1: Both factors positive**\n   *  (x - 15) > 0  => x > 15\n   *  (x - 35) > 0  => x > 35\n   * Combining both conditions, x > 35\n\n* **Case 2: Both factors negative**\n   *  (x - 15) < 0  => x < 15\n   *  (x - 35) < 0  => x < 35\n   * Combining both conditions, x < 15\n\n**5. Applying the Context:**\n\nThe question asks for the investment range that guarantees *at least* 8% return. This means we are looking for the range where the inequality holds true for positive values of x (as investment cannot be negative). \n\nTherefore, the solution is x > 35 or x < 15.  However, the question specifically asks for the range of investments in *thousands of dollars* that yields at least 8%. So, the answer is **15 \u2264 x \u2264 35**, as it represents the range of investments (in thousands of dollars) where the return is at least 8%.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This type of question frequently appears in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, emphasizing the importance of quadratic equations and inequalities.\n* Understanding how to translate real-world scenarios into mathematical expressions is crucial for solving these problems. \n* Always consider the context and constraints of the problem while interpreting the solutions. \n* Practice solving similar problems to gain proficiency in this topic. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks us to represent the daily stock price fluctuations that are considered stable using an absolute value inequality.  Let's break down the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Stable Price:** The stock price is considered stable if its daily change is within $2.50 of its average price of $50.00. This means the price can fluctuate up or down by a maximum of $2.50 from the average.\n* **Absolute Value:** The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero, regardless of its sign. In this context, we use absolute value to represent the *difference* between the daily stock price and the average price, without worrying about whether the price is higher or lower.\n\n**The Correct Inequality:**\n\nOption (a) |x - 50| \u2264 2.50 is the correct answer. Here's why:\n\n* **x:** Represents the daily stock price.\n* **x - 50:** Represents the difference between the daily stock price and the average price.\n* **|x - 50|:**  Represents the absolute value of that difference, indicating the distance from the average price.\n* **\u2264 2.50:**  Means this distance must be less than or equal to $2.50 for the price to be considered stable.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **(b) |x + 50| \u2265 2.50:**  This inequality would indicate that the difference between the stock price and the average price must be greater than or equal to $2.50, which is not what we want for stable prices.\n* **(c) |x - 50| > 2.50:** Similar to (b), this inequality suggests that the difference must be greater than $2.50, making the price fluctuate beyond the acceptable range.\n* **(d) |x + 50| < 2.50:**  While using the correct operator (<), this option is incorrect because it adds 50 to the daily stock price, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Absolute value inequalities are used to express limits on distances from a specific value.** In this case, the limit is the acceptable fluctuation in stock price.\n* **Pay close attention to the inequality symbol (\u2264, <, \u2265, >).** These symbols dictate the relationship between the distance and the allowed limit.\n* **Always consider the context of the problem when interpreting absolute value inequalities.** Understanding the meaning behind the variables and the inequality will help you choose the correct option.\n\n**For IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThese types of questions are common in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Real Return vs. Nominal Return:**\n\n* **Nominal Return:** This is the stated interest rate offered by the bank. \n* **Real Return:** This is the actual return you get after adjusting for inflation. It reflects the actual increase in your purchasing power.\n\n**2. Calculating Real Return:**\n\nReal Return = (1 + Nominal Return) / (1 + Inflation Rate) - 1\n\n**3. The Investor's Goal:**\n\nThe investor wants a real return of 2%.  With an inflation rate of 1.5%, they need a nominal return that exceeds the inflation rate by 2%. This means:\n\n* Nominal Return = 1.5% (inflation) + 2% (desired real return) = 3.5%\n\n**4. The Bank's Bonus Mechanism:**\n\nThe bank offers a 1% bonus if inflation exceeds the interest earned. This bonus effectively reduces the minimum interest rate the bank needs to offer to reach the required nominal return.\n\n**5. Determining the Minimum Interest Rate:**\n\nSince the bank offers a potential 1% bonus, the minimum interest rate they need to provide is:\n\n* Minimum Interest Rate = 3.5% (required nominal return) - 1% (potential bonus) = 2.5%\n\n**6. Why Option C (4.5%) is Correct:**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum interest rate the bank needs to offer **to meet the investor's desired real return, considering the potential inflation bonus**. This means the bank needs to offer an interest rate that, with the potential bonus, would guarantee the 2% real return.\n\n* If the bank offers 4.5% interest, and inflation stays at 1.5%, the investor earns 4.5%, exceeding the required 3.5% for a 2% real return.\n* If inflation surpasses 4.5%, the bank would provide the 1% bonus, bringing the total return to 5.5%, exceeding the 3.5% target and ensuring the 2% real return.\n\n**Therefore, option C (4.5%) is the correct answer.** The bank needs to offer a minimum of 4.5% interest to guarantee the investor a real return of at least 2%, even with the potential bonus. \n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO & SBI PO:**\n\n* **Understand the concept of real return and how to calculate it.**\n* **Be aware of how inflation affects investment returns.**\n* **Analyze bonus mechanisms and how they influence investment decisions.**\n* **Practice similar problems to improve your ability to solve complex scenarios involving interest rates, inflation, and real returns.** \n",

This is a crucial concept in mathematics and particularly relevant for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, where you might encounter problems related to loan eligibility, interest calculations, etc.\n\n**Let's break down the answer:**\n\n* **Correct Answer: A. 5000 \u2264 L < 20000 and 650 \u2264 S and D < 0.40 and 3 \u2264 T \u2264 5** \n\nThis answer is correct because it accurately represents the **simultaneous** requirements of the loan program:\n\n1. **Loan Amount (L):**  The loan amount must be **at least** $5,000 (meaning it can be equal to $5,000) and **less than** $20,000. This is represented by the inequality 5000 \u2264 L < 20000.\n2. **Credit Score (S):**  The borrower must have a credit score of **at least** 650 (meaning it can be equal to 650). This is represented by the inequality 650 \u2264 S.\n3. **Debt-to-Income Ratio (D):** The debt-to-income ratio must be **less than** 40%. This is represented by the inequality D < 0.40.\n4. **Loan Term (T):** The loan term must be **between** 3 and 5 years **inclusive**, meaning it can be 3, 4, or 5 years. This is represented by the inequality 3 \u2264 T \u2264 5.\n\n**The 'and' operator is crucial here.** It signifies that **all** these conditions must be met simultaneously for a borrower to qualify for the loan. \n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **B. 5000 \u2264 L < 20000 or 650 \u2264 S or D < 0.40 or 3 \u2264 T \u2264 5:** This option uses the 'or' operator. It means that only **one** of these conditions needs to be met, which is not what the loan program requires. \n* **C. 5000 \u2264 L < 20000 and 650 \u2264 S and D < 0.40 and 3 \u2264 T < 5:** This option incorrectly excludes 5 years from the loan term, as the inequality only includes values **less than** 5. \n* **D. 5000 \u2264 L < 20000 and 650 \u2264 S and D < 0.40 or 3 \u2264 T \u2264 5:** This option incorrectly mixes 'and' and 'or' operators. The loan term should be subject to the same 'and' condition as the other requirements.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Inequalities:** Familiarize yourself with the different inequality symbols (<, >, \u2264, \u2265) and how they represent different relationships between values.\n* **Logical Operators:** Understand how 'and' and 'or' operators are used to combine inequalities, and how they influence the conditions being met.\n* **Real-World Application:** Be able to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios like loan programs, financial calculations, etc.\n\n**Practice Tip:** Try to create similar problems using real-world data and practice combining inequalities with the correct logical operators to represent the given conditions. This will help you develop a stronger understanding of the concept and excel in your banking exam preparation. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question focuses on understanding the **multiplicative property of inequality** and its application in a real-world financial scenario.  Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Setting up the Inequality:**\n\n* **Client's target:**  The advisor recommends investing no more than 30% of the portfolio in high-risk stocks.\n* **Current investment:** The client has $160,000 invested in high-risk stocks.\n* **Total portfolio:** The total portfolio value is $500,000.\n* **Amount to sell:** Let 'x' represent the amount of money the client needs to sell.\n\nTherefore, the inequality representing the scenario is:\n\n**160,000 - x \u2264 0.3 * 500,000**\n\nThis translates to: \"The current high-risk investment minus the amount to sell should be less than or equal to 30% of the total portfolio.\"\n\n**2. Simplifying the Inequality:**\n\n* Calculate 0.3 * 500,000 = 150,000\n* The simplified inequality becomes: **160,000 - x \u2264 150,000**\n\n**3. Isolating the variable 'x':**\n\n* Subtract 160,000 from both sides of the inequality:\n   **-x \u2264 -10,000**\n\n**4.  Multiplying by -1/1000:**\n\n* To isolate 'x', we need to multiply both sides by -1/1000. **Important:** Multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number *flips* the inequality sign.\n\n* Therefore, the new inequality becomes: **-0.001x \u2265 10**\n\n**5.  Understanding the Inequality Symbol Change:**\n\n* The inequality symbol changes from \u2264 (less than or equal to) to \u2265 (greater than or equal to) because we multiplied by a negative number.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **D) -0.001x \u2265 10, Inequality symbol flips**. This inequality represents the constraint that the client needs to sell enough high-risk stocks to bring their high-risk investment down to 30% or less of their total portfolio.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to banking exams because it assesses your ability to:\n\n* **Apply mathematical concepts:** You need to understand the concept of inequalities and their properties, specifically the multiplicative property.\n* **Solve word problems:** The question requires translating a real-world financial scenario into a mathematical expression.\n* **Analyze and interpret results:** You need to interpret the final inequality and understand its implications in terms of the client's investment strategy.\n\n**Tips for similar questions:**\n\n* **Identify the key information:** Clearly identify the variables, constraints, and target goals mentioned in the problem.\n* **Translate the scenario into an inequality:** Use appropriate mathematical symbols (<, >, \u2264, \u2265) to represent the relationships between the variables.\n* **Simplify the inequality:** Use algebraic operations to isolate the variable of interest.\n* **Remember the multiplicative property of inequality:** Multiplying both sides by a negative number flips the inequality symbol.\n* **Interpret the final inequality:** Ensure you understand the meaning of the inequality in the context of the problem. \n",

            "question": "A bank offers two investment plans. Plan A offers a guaranteed return of 4% per year, while Plan B offers a return that varies depending on market conditions. The minimum guaranteed return for Plan B is 2.5%, but it can reach up to 8% based on market performance. If a customer invests $10,000 in Plan A and an additional $x in Plan B, and wants to ensure a total minimum annual return of at least $600, what is the minimum value of x, rounded to the nearest dollar, that the customer should invest in Plan B?",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of how to use inequalities to solve financial problems related to investments. Here's a breakdown of why option (C) is correct:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem involves two investment plans with different return rates. Plan A provides a guaranteed return, while Plan B's return is variable. The customer wants to ensure a minimum total return of $600. We need to find the minimum amount the customer should invest in Plan B to achieve this goal.\n\n**2. Setting up the Inequality:**\n\n* **Plan A:** The customer invests $10,000 in Plan A, with a 4% guaranteed return. This means the minimum return from Plan A is 0.04 * $10,000 = $400.\n* **Plan B:** The customer invests an additional $x in Plan B. The minimum return on Plan B is 2.5%, and the maximum is 8%.\n* **Total Return:** The customer wants a minimum total return of $600. \n\nWe can express this information as an inequality:\n\n$400 + 0.025x \\ge 600$\n\n**3. Solving the Inequality:**\n\n* Subtract 400 from both sides: \n   $0.025x \\ge 200$\n\n* Divide both sides by 0.025:\n   $x \\ge 8000$\n\nThis means the customer needs to invest at least $8000 in Plan B to guarantee a minimum return of $600.\n\n**4. Adjusting for the Existing Investment:**\n\nThe customer already invested $10,000 in Plan A. Therefore, the minimum additional investment required in Plan B is:\n\n$8000 - $10,000 = -$2000\n\nA negative investment amount is not possible. This indicates the customer already has enough invested in Plan A to reach the $600 minimum return target.\n\n**5. Considering Maximum Return from Plan B:**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum investment in Plan B *even though* the customer can achieve the desired return through Plan A alone. This suggests the customer wants to take advantage of the potential higher returns from Plan B.\n\n* If Plan B reaches its maximum return of 8%, the customer needs to invest $200 / 0.08 = $2500 to generate the remaining $200 needed to reach the $600 target.\n\n**6. Final Answer:**\n\nThe minimum value of x (the additional investment in Plan B) that the customer should invest to potentially reach the 8% return is $2,500.  Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer.\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Inequalities:** Use inequalities to represent financial conditions involving minimum or maximum values.\n* **Combining Investments:** When dealing with multiple investments, ensure the total return satisfies the desired target.\n* **Potential Returns:** Consider the potential returns from investments with variable rates to make informed decisions.\n\n**This detailed explanation should help you understand how to solve similar problems involving inequalities and investment scenarios.  Remember to carefully analyze the problem, set up the inequality correctly, and consider all relevant factors before arriving at the final answer.** \n",

The platform defines specific criteria for compatibility:\n\n1. **Age Range:**  Both the user and the suggested friend should be between 25 and 40 years old (inclusive).\n2. **Relationship Status:** Both the user and the friend should either be \"single\" or \"in a relationship\" (not engaged or married) and they should have the same relationship status.\n\nLet's break down why option (C) is the correct answer:\n\n```python\n(user_age >= 25 and user_age <= 40) and (user_status in ['single', 'relationship']) and (user_status == friend_status) and (friend_age >= 25 and friend_age <= 40)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Age Range:** The code uses `>= 25` and `<= 40` to ensure that the user's age (`user_age`) and the friend's age (`friend_age`) fall within the specified range, **including** the boundary values (25 and 40).\n* **Relationship Status:**\n    * The code uses `user_status in ['single', 'relationship']` to check if the user's relationship status is either \"single\" or \"in a relationship\". This utilizes the `in` operator for membership testing within a list.\n    * The code then uses `user_status == friend_status` to ensure that the user and the suggested friend have the same relationship status. This directly compares the values stored in the `user_status` and `friend_status` variables. \n* **Logical Operators:** The code uses `and` operators to connect all the conditions. This means all the conditions must be true for the suggestion to be made.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option (A):** This option uses `and` instead of `or` in the relationship status comparison, making it incorrect. The algorithm allows for suggestions where both user and friend are either single or in a relationship, not both.\n* **Option (B):** This option uses `or` instead of `and` for relationship status and `<` instead of `<=` for age range, causing incorrect suggestions. It allows for suggestions even if the user and friend have different relationship statuses.\n* **Option (D):** This option uses `!=` to compare relationship statuses, which is incorrect because the algorithm requires similar statuses.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of:\n\n* **Conditional Statements:**  Using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to combine conditions.\n* **Comparison Operators:** Using operators like `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=` to compare values.\n* **Data Structures:** Using lists (`['single', 'relationship']`) for data representation and membership testing.\n\nThese concepts are essential for handling real-world data and implementing logic in various programming scenarios, particularly relevant for roles in the banking sector where analytical skills are highly valued. \n",

This means we need to solve the inequality:\n\n**P \u2265 1.5**\n\nSubstituting the given equation for P, we get:\n\n**2^(x/2) - 3^(x/3) + 1 \u2265 1.5**\n\n**1. Simplifying the Inequality:**\n\nSubtracting 1.5 from both sides, we get:\n\n**2^(x/2) - 3^(x/3) - 0.5 \u2265 0**\n\n**2.  The Challenge:**\n\nSolving this inequality directly for x is difficult because of the mixed bases (2 and 3). This is where a graphical approach or numerical analysis becomes crucial.\n\n**3. Graphical Approach:**\n\n* **Graph the Function:** Plot the function y = 2^(x/2) - 3^(x/3) - 0.5. You can use a graphing calculator or online plotting software for this.\n* **Identify the Intersection:**  The graph will intersect the x-axis at a point. This intersection point is the critical value that separates the regions where the function is greater than zero (positive profit) and less than zero (negative profit).\n* **Analyze the Graph:**  Notice that the function is greater than or equal to zero (y \u2265 0) for values of x to the right of the intersection point. This is because the function's value is positive in this region.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nThe solution to the inequality 2^(x/2) - 3^(x/3) - 0.5 \u2265 0 is **x > 3**. This means the company will achieve a profit of at least 1.5 million dollars **after 3 years** of its founding.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **(A) 0 < x < 3:** This range would imply the profit is less than 1.5 million dollars, which is the opposite of what we want.\n* **(C) 1 < x < 4:** This range might be misidentified due to an error in visually determining the intersection point on the graph.\n* **(D) x < 1:** This solution might result from an incorrect understanding of the function's behavior and its intersection with the x-axis.\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Mixed Bases:**  Inequalities with mixed bases are often difficult to solve directly.  Graphical methods are helpful in such cases.\n* **Interpreting Graphs:**  Understanding the relationship between the graph and the inequality is crucial to determine the solution.\n* **Banking Exam Relevance:**  Solving inequalities is a fundamental skill in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  These exams often test your ability to solve problems involving exponential functions, growth rates, and financial models. \n\nBy mastering the concept of solving inequalities with exponents and using graphical methods, you can confidently tackle such questions in your banking exam preparation. \n",
