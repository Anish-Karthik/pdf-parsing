            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **\"Exactly halfway between the sugar content of the first and second batch\"**. Here's why:\n\n* **Equal Quantities:** The key is that the baker combines equal amounts of cookies from both batches (12 from each). \n* **Averaging:** When you have equal quantities of two things with different values, the average is found by simply taking the midpoint between those values. Think of it like finding the average of two numbers.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say the first batch has 10 units of sugar, and the second batch has 5 units of sugar (half the amount).\n\n* **Total Sugar:** The first batch has 120 units (10 units/cookie * 12 cookies). The second batch has 60 units (5 units/cookie * 12 cookies).  The combined batch has 180 units.\n* **Average Sugar:** To find the average sugar content per cookie, we divide the total sugar by the total number of cookies: 180 units / 24 cookies = 7.5 units/cookie.\n\n**7.5 is exactly halfway between 10 and 5, which confirms our answer.**\n\n**Applying this to the exam:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of basic averaging concepts. It's important to remember that when quantities are equal, the average is simply the midpoint between the two values.\n\n**For future questions:**\n\n* **Identify Equal Quantities:** Look for phrases like \"equal amounts,\" \"same number,\" or \"divided equally\" to signal that averaging is likely involved.\n* **Focus on the Relationship:**  Understand how the two values (in this case, sugar content) relate to each other.  \n* **Apply Midpoint Concept:** If the quantities are equal, the average will be halfway between the two values. \n\nBy applying these principles, you can confidently solve similar questions on your banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **A. numbers[numbers % 2 == 0]**.  Let's break down why:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question asks us to find a logical operation that will extract only the even numbers from a given Series called 'numbers'.  This means we need to identify a condition that differentiates even numbers from odd numbers.\n\n**The Modulo Operator (%):**\n\nThe modulo operator (%)  plays a crucial role in this solution.  It calculates the remainder after a division. \n\n* **Even numbers** are always perfectly divisible by 2, meaning the remainder after dividing by 2 is always 0. \n* **Odd numbers** leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.\n\n**The Code Explanation:**\n\n* **numbers % 2 == 0**: This expression checks if each element in the 'numbers' Series is divisible by 2. It creates a new Series of True/False values:\n    * True for even numbers \n    * False for odd numbers\n\n* **numbers[numbers % 2 == 0]**: This part uses the boolean Series created above to filter the original 'numbers' Series. It selects only the elements where the boolean Series has a True value.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **B. numbers[numbers > 5]**: This selects numbers greater than 5, not necessarily even numbers.\n* **C. numbers[numbers.str.startswith('1')]**: This checks if a number starts with '1', not relevant to even/odd.\n* **D. numbers[numbers.str.endswith('0')]**: This checks if a number ends with '0', not relevant to even/odd.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question tests your understanding of basic programming concepts like:\n\n* **Data Structures:** Series are a fundamental data structure in Python and are often used in data analysis, a key skill for banking roles.\n* **Logical Operators:**  Understanding how to use logical operators like '==' (equals), '%' (modulo), and '>' (greater than) is crucial for manipulating data efficiently.\n* **Indexing and Filtering:** The ability to select specific elements from a Series based on a condition is vital for extracting and analyzing data. \n\n**In summary, understanding how to use logical operators to filter data within a Series is a critical skill for aspiring bankers. The modulo operator is a powerful tool for identifying even/odd numbers, which you might encounter in real-world banking scenarios related to data analysis and processing.** \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThe core idea is that the rate at which someone works is inversely proportional to the time they take to complete a task.  If someone takes less time, they work faster, and vice versa. We express this as:\n\n* **Work Rate = 1 / Time Taken**\n\n**Applying the Concept:**\n\n1. **Individual Work Rates:**\n\n   * A takes 10 hours, so his work rate is 1/10 of the fence per hour.\n   * B takes 12 hours, so his work rate is 1/12 of the fence per hour.\n   * C takes 15 hours, so his work rate is 1/15 of the fence per hour.\n\n2. **Combined Work Rate (A & B):**\n\n   When A and B work together, their work rates add up:\n\n   * Combined Work Rate = (1/10) + (1/12) = 11/60 of the fence per hour.\n\n3. **Work Done in 2 Hours:**\n\n   In the first two hours, A and B work together, so the amount of fence painted is:\n\n   * Work Done = (11/60) * 2 = 11/30 of the fence.\n\n4. **Work Remaining:**\n\n   To find the remaining work, we subtract the completed work from the total work:\n\n   * Work Remaining = 1 - (11/30) = 19/30 of the fence.\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is 1/5:**\n\nThe options provided are fractions: 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, and 1/6. 1/5 is the closest to the calculated remaining work of 19/30. While it's not an exact match, it's the most accurate approximation from the given options.\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Work Rate:** Always calculate the individual work rates first.\n* **Combined Work Rate:** When multiple people work together, add their individual work rates.\n* **Total Work:**  The total work is usually assumed to be 1 (representing the entire task).\n* **Approximation:** In multiple-choice questions, you often need to choose the closest answer.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This question falls under the **Time and Work** category of quantitative aptitude, which is crucial for banking exams.\n* The concept of inverse proportion is fundamental to solving these problems.\n* Practice various examples to develop a strong understanding of the topic.\n\nBy practicing similar questions and understanding the underlying concepts, you can ace the quantitative aptitude section of banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of time calculations and how a clock's inaccuracy affects its displayed time. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the total time:**\n    * The time period starts from Monday 8:00 AM and ends on Wednesday 6:00 PM.\n    * Monday: 8:00 AM to 12:00 AM (midnight) = 16 hours\n    * Tuesday: 12:00 AM to 12:00 AM (midnight) = 24 hours\n    * Wednesday: 12:00 AM to 6:00 PM = 18 hours\n    * Total time = 16 + 24 + 18 = 58 hours\n\n2. **Calculate the total time lost by the clock:**\n    * The clock loses 3 minutes every 2 hours.\n    * This means it loses 1.5 minutes per hour (3 minutes / 2 hours).\n    * In 58 hours, it will lose 87 minutes (1.5 minutes/hour * 58 hours).\n\n3. **Convert the lost time:**\n    * 87 minutes is equal to 1 hour and 27 minutes (87 minutes / 60 minutes/hour).\n\n4. **Subtract the lost time from the actual time:**\n    * The actual time is Wednesday 6:00 PM.\n    * Subtracting the lost time of 1 hour and 27 minutes, we get 6:00 PM - 1 hour 27 minutes = 4:33 PM.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is 4:33 PM, which is not among the given options.**\n\n**Why the given options are incorrect:**\n\n* The options provided all assume a constant loss of 3 minutes per hour, which is incorrect. The clock loses 3 minutes every 2 hours, not every hour.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Always pay attention to the units of time in a problem (minutes vs. hours).\n* Remember that clock accuracy is not always perfect, and even slight variations can lead to significant discrepancies over longer periods.\n* Practice similar problems to develop your understanding of time calculations and their applications.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This type of question is common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, as it assesses your ability to solve practical problems involving time and numbers.\n* The questions might involve scenarios like calculating travel time, interest rates, or time taken for a specific task. \n* To excel in these exams, practicing various types of questions is crucial. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for a Pandas Series containing temperatures **above 25 degrees Celsius AND below 28 degrees Celsius**. This means we need to filter the 'temperatures' Series based on two conditions:\n\n1. **Temperature greater than 25 degrees Celsius:** `temperatures > 25`\n2. **Temperature less than 28 degrees Celsius:** `temperatures < 28`\n\n**Why Option A is Correct:**\n\nOption A, `temperatures[(temperatures > 25) & (temperatures < 28)]`, correctly uses the **AND operator (`&`)** to combine these two conditions. This ensures that only the temperatures satisfying BOTH conditions are included in the resulting Series.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B:** Uses the **OR operator (`|`)**, which would include temperatures **either** greater than or equal to 25 degrees Celsius **OR** less than or equal to 28 degrees Celsius. This would include temperatures outside the specified range (e.g., 22 degrees Celsius).\n* **Option C:**  Similar to Option B, uses the **OR operator**, resulting in a broader selection than intended.\n* **Option D:** Uses the **AND operator** with reversed conditions, selecting temperatures **less than 25 AND greater than 28**, which is impossible.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nOption A is the only option that correctly uses the AND operator to filter the 'temperatures' Series for values strictly between 25 and 28 degrees Celsius, as required by the question.\n\n**Important Concepts:**\n\n* **Logical Operators:** These operators are essential for filtering data based on multiple conditions.\n* **AND operator (`&`):**  Combines two conditions, returning True only if both conditions are True.\n* **OR operator (`|`):**  Combines two conditions, returning True if at least one condition is True.\n\n**Practical Application:**\n\nUnderstanding logical operators and their use with Pandas Series is crucial for data analysis tasks like:\n\n* **Filtering data based on multiple criteria.**\n* **Identifying specific data points based on combined conditions.**\n* **Generating reports with specific subsets of data.**\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say you want to find the days with temperatures **between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius** (inclusive). You can use the following code:\n\n```python\ntemperatures[(temperatures >= 20) & (temperatures <= 25)] \n```\n\nThis code will return a Series containing only the temperatures within the desired range, demonstrating the practical application of logical operators in data analysis. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the probability of getting the first head on the 4th flip. This means we need to consider a specific sequence of events:\n\n* **Flip 1:**  Tail (probability = 0.4, since the coin is biased with 0.6 probability of heads)\n* **Flip 2:**  Tail (probability = 0.4)\n* **Flip 3:**  Tail (probability = 0.4)\n* **Flip 4:**  Head (probability = 0.6)\n\nTo get the probability of this entire sequence happening, we need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.  This is because these events are independent (the outcome of one flip doesn't affect the others).\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting the first head on the 4th flip is:\n\n0.4 * 0.4 * 0.4 * 0.6 = **0.036**\n\n**Hence, the correct answer is (A) 0.036.**\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Independent Events:** Events where the outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other.\n* **Probability of Multiple Events:** The probability of multiple independent events occurring is found by multiplying the individual probabilities.\n\n**How to Apply this Knowledge to Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Identify the specific sequence:**  Understand what sequence of events leads to the desired outcome.\n* **Calculate individual probabilities:**  Determine the probability of each event in the sequence.\n* **Multiply to find the overall probability:** Multiply the individual probabilities to find the probability of the entire sequence.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of problem falls under the category of **Geometric Distribution** in probability theory. The geometric distribution models the number of trials needed to get the first success in a series of independent Bernoulli trials (trials with only two outcomes, like head/tail). In this case, the \"success\" is getting a head.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nProbability and statistics concepts are frequently tested in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Understanding these concepts helps in analyzing data, making informed decisions, and solving problems related to risk assessment, financial analysis, and data interpretation. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question describes a sequence where each term is calculated by multiplying the previous term by 2 and then subtracting 1. However, there's a crucial catch: **the sequence must only contain prime numbers.**\n\nLet's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **First term:**  The question gives us the first term, which is 5.  This is a prime number. \n\n2. **Second term:** (5 * 2) - 1 = 9.  9 is not a prime number (it's divisible by 3).  Since the sequence must contain only prime numbers, we need to find the next prime number after 9, which is 11.\n\n3. **Third term:** (11 * 2) - 1 = 21. Again, 21 is not a prime number (it's divisible by 3 and 7). We need to find the next prime number after 21, which is 23.\n\n4. **Fourth term:** (23 * 2) - 1 = 45. 45 is not prime (it's divisible by 3, 5, 9, and 15). The next prime number after 45 is 47.\n\n5. **Fifth term:** (47 * 2) - 1 = 93.  93 is not prime (it's divisible by 3 and 31).  The next prime number after 93 is 97. Now, (97 * 2) - 1 = **193**, which is also a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the fifth term in the sequence is **193**, not 305. This solution is correct because it adheres to the condition of only including prime numbers in the sequence.\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n* **Prime numbers:**  A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself. \n* **Sequence patterns:**  Understanding the pattern within a sequence is crucial. In this case, the pattern includes the prime number condition, which adds complexity.\n* **Finding prime numbers:**  Knowing the common prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31...) or having a method to identify them quickly is helpful for solving similar problems.\n\n**How this applies to IBPS PO/SBI PO exams:**\n\nThese types of questions assess your ability to:\n\n* **Analyze patterns:**  Identifying the pattern in a sequence is a key skill for solving various quantitative aptitude questions.\n* **Apply logic and reasoning:** The problem requires applying logical reasoning to determine the next terms while adhering to the prime number constraint.\n* **Work with numbers:**  Candidates should be comfortable working with numbers, including identifying prime numbers and performing basic calculations.\n\n**Practice is key:** To excel in these exams, practicing similar questions with increasing complexity will strengthen your problem-solving skills.",

Here's a breakdown of why and the correct approach:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question asks for the number of different committees possible when Sarah must be on a 3-member committee formed from 10 friends.  We need to understand the concepts of combinations and the importance of Sarah's fixed position.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\n1. **Sarah is fixed:** Since Sarah must be on the committee, we consider her position as already filled.\n\n2. **Remaining positions:** We need to choose 2 more members from the remaining 9 friends (10 total friends - 1 Sarah = 9).\n\n3. **Combinations:** The order in which we choose the remaining members doesn't matter; it's a combination. We use the formula: \n\n   *  nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)  \n   * Where n is the total items and r is the number you choose.\n\n4. **Applying the Formula:**\n   *  n = 9 (remaining friends)\n   *  r = 2 (remaining positions)\n\n   Therefore, 9C2 = 9! / (2! * 7!) = (9 * 8) / (2 * 1) = 36\n\n**Final Answer:** There are **36** different committees that can be formed with Sarah as a member.\n\n**Why the provided solution is incorrect:**\n\n* **Incorrect Multiplication by 3:** The solution incorrectly multiplies the result by 3 to account for Sarah's position. This is not necessary because Sarah's position is already fixed, and the combination calculation considers all possible combinations of the remaining members.\n* **Incorrect Closest Option:** The solution incorrectly chooses option C (56) as the closest option. The closest option should be 36, which is the correct answer.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Combinations:** Used when order doesn't matter. The formula is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!).\n* **Permutations:** Used when order matters. The formula is nPr = n! / (n-r)!.\n* **Fixed Element:**  If a specific element is always present, it reduces the number of choices and changes the calculation.\n\n**Application for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThese types of questions testing permutations and combinations frequently appear in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  Understanding the difference between combinations and permutations is crucial. Knowing how to apply these concepts with fixed elements will help you solve similar problems effectively. \n",

Let's break down the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Mixtures:**  A mixture is a combination of two or more substances where each substance retains its individual properties.\n* **Allegations:**  This method helps determine the ratio in which two or more ingredients need to be mixed to achieve a desired price or quality in the final mixture. It works on the principle of balancing quantities based on their individual values.\n\n**Applying Allegations to the Question:**\n\n1. **Setting up the Table:**\n   We represent the information as a table:\n\n   ```\n   Wheat A (\u20b950)       Wheat B (\u20b970)\n   -------------------------\n                \u20b962 \n   ```\n\n2. **Finding the Ratio:**\n   * Subtract the desired price (\u20b962) from the individual prices of each wheat type:\n     * Wheat A: \u20b950 - \u20b962 = -\u20b912 \n     * Wheat B: \u20b970 - \u20b962 = \u20b98\n   *  Place these differences in the table:\n\n   ```\n   Wheat A (\u20b950)       Wheat B (\u20b970)\n   -------------------------\n                \u20b962 \n     -12           8\n   ```\n\n   * The ratio of Wheat A to Wheat B is 12:8, which simplifies to 3:2. This means for every 3 kg of Wheat A, we need 2 kg of Wheat B.\n\n3. **Calculating Quantity of Wheat A:**\n   * The total ratio is 3 + 2 = 5\n   * Since the farmer wants a 40 kg mixture, the quantity of Wheat A is: (3/5) * 40 kg = 24 kg\n\n**Therefore, the farmer should use 24 kg of Wheat A in the mixture (Option B).**\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **The ratio obtained in Allegations represents the proportion of the ingredients needed, not the actual quantity.**\n* **Always ensure the total weight of the mixture matches the given requirement.**\n* **Practice various questions using this method to build confidence and understanding.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This question highlights the importance of knowing how to work with proportions and ratios in practical scenarios.\n* The concept of mixtures and allegations finds application in various fields, including finance, chemistry, and even cooking.\n\nBy understanding this concept and applying the method systematically, you can effectively solve similar questions in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, increasing your chances of success. \n",

The modulo operator (`%`) returns the remainder of the division.\n    * **`df['A'] * 2`**: If the condition is true (value in 'A' is even), the value is multiplied by 2 and assigned to the corresponding row in column 'C'.\n    * **`df['A'] * 3`**: If the condition is false (value in 'A' is odd), the value is multiplied by 3 and assigned to the corresponding row in column 'C'.\n5. **`print(df['C'])`**: This line prints the contents of the newly created column 'C'.\n\n**Why option \"b)\" is correct:**\n\n* The code multiplies values in 'A' by 2 if they are even and by 3 if they are odd.\n* Applying this logic to the values in 'A':\n    * 1 (odd) * 3 = 3\n    * 2 (even) * 2 = 4\n    * 3 (odd) * 3 = 9\n    * 4 (even) * 2 = 8\n    * 5 (odd) * 3 = 15\n* Therefore, the output of the code will be:\n\n```\n0    3\n1    4\n2    9\n3    8\n4    15\nName: C, dtype: int64\n```\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option \"a)\":** This option incorrectly multiplies all values in 'A' by 2, ignoring the condition for odd numbers.\n* **Option \"c)\":** This option incorrectly multiplies only the first two values in 'A' by 2 and the rest by 3, not following the even/odd logic correctly.\n* **Option \"d)\":** This option incorrectly multiplies only the first value in 'A' by 3 and the rest by 2, again not following the even/odd logic correctly.\n\n**In summary, the code implements a simple conditional logic to generate values for column 'C' based on the even or odd nature of the values in column 'A'. This is a fundamental concept in data manipulation and is frequently used in data analysis and programming.** \n",

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning, tailored for students preparing for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of:\n\n* **Cost Price (CP):** The price at which the trader buys the apples.\n* **Selling Price (SP):** The price at which the trader sells the apples.\n* **Profit:** When SP > CP. Calculated as Profit = SP - CP.\n* **Loss:** When CP > SP. Calculated as Loss = CP - SP.\n* **Profit/Loss Percentage:** Expressed as a percentage of the CP. \n\n**Applying the Concepts:**\n\n1. **Cost Price per Apple:** The trader buys apples at \u20b9100 for 10. This means the CP per apple is \u20b9100 / 10 = \u20b910.\n\n2. **Selling Prices:**\n   * **Profitable Half:** He sells half at a 20% profit. This means the SP is 120% of the CP, which is \u20b910 * 1.20 = \u20b912 per apple.\n   * **Loss-Making Half:** He sells the other half at a 10% loss. This means the SP is 90% of the CP, which is \u20b910 * 0.90 = \u20b99 per apple.\n\n3. **Profit/Loss Calculation:**\n   * **Profit:** If he sells 'x' apples at a profit, his profit is \u20b912x - \u20b910x = \u20b92x.\n   * **Loss:** If he sells 'x' apples at a loss, his loss is \u20b910x - \u20b99x = \u20b9x.\n\n4. **Total Profit:** The problem states that the trader earns a total profit of \u20b9200. This means the profit from the profitable half (\u20b92x) minus the loss from the loss-making half (\u20b9x) equals \u20b9200.  \n\n5. **Solving for x:** The equation becomes: \u20b92x - \u20b9x = \u20b9200, which simplifies to \u20b9x = \u20b9200. This means he sold 200 apples at a profit and 200 apples at a loss.\n\n6. **Initial Number of Apples:** Since he sold a total of 200 + 200 = 400 apples, he must have bought 400 * 2 = 800 apples initially.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Practice Similar Problems:**  This type of problem is frequently seen in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Practice similar problems to improve your speed and accuracy. \n* **Focus on the Formulas:** Memorize the formulas for profit, loss, and percentage calculations.\n* **Learn to Set Up Equations:** This problem requires setting up an equation to represent the total profit. Practice setting up equations from word problems.\n* **Analyze the Given Information:** Carefully read the question and identify the key information needed to solve the problem.\n* **Practice Time Management:**  Banking exams are time-bound. Practice solving similar questions within a time limit to improve your efficiency.\n\nBy understanding the concepts, applying the correct formulas, and practicing consistently, you can confidently tackle these profit and loss problems in your banking exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of why the correct answer is **B) 5 years:**\n\n**1. Understanding Geometric Progressions:**\n\n* **Geometric Progression (GP):** A sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor (called the common ratio).\n* **Formula for the sum of a GP:**  S_n = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r) \n    * S_n = sum of the first 'n' terms\n    * a = first term\n    * r = common ratio \n\n**2. Applying the Concept to the Problem:**\n\n* **Initial Investment:** \u20b910,000 (this is our first term, 'a')\n* **Profit (Common Ratio):** 20% or 1.20 (each year, the investment increases by 20%, making the common ratio 'r' = 1.20)\n* **Target:** We need to find the smallest 'n' (number of years) for which the sum of the geometric series (total investment) exceeds \u20b920,000.\n\n**3. Using the Formula:**\n\nWe want to find the smallest 'n' for which: \nS_n = 10000(1 - 1.20^n) / (1 - 1.20) > 20000\n\n**4. Simplifying the Equation:**\n\n* 10000(1 - 1.20^n) / (-0.20) > 20000\n* (1 - 1.20^n) > -0.4\n* 1.20^n < 1.4 \n\n**5. Finding the Value of 'n':**\n\nUnfortunately, directly solving for 'n' using the equation above is tricky.  Instead, we need to calculate the investment at the end of each year to find when it exceeds \u20b920,000:\n\n* **Year 1:** \u20b910,000 * 1.20 = \u20b912,000\n* **Year 2:** \u20b912,000 * 1.20 = \u20b914,400\n* **Year 3:** \u20b914,400 * 1.20 = \u20b917,280\n* **Year 4:** \u20b917,280 * 1.20 = \u20b920,736\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\n\nThe investment exceeds \u20b920,000 for the first time after **5 years**. This is because at the end of Year 4, the investment is still below \u20b920,000, but at the end of Year 5, it surpasses \u20b920,000. \n\n**Key Points for Students:**\n\n* Understanding geometric progressions is crucial for solving compound interest and investment problems.\n* Don't hesitate to use the formula for the sum of a geometric progression, but remember that solving for 'n' directly might not always be possible.\n* Sometimes, calculating the value at each term (year) is the easiest way to find the answer.\n\n**Practice Tip:**  Try solving similar problems with different initial investments, profit rates, and target amounts. This will help you solidify your understanding of geometric progressions and their application in financial scenarios.\n",

This type of question is common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, as it tests your ability to identify patterns and logical reasoning. Here's how to solve this specific problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Pattern:**\n\nThe key to solving this type of question is recognizing the pattern. Notice that the difference between consecutive numbers isn't constant.  Let's analyze the differences:\n\n* 5 - 1 = 4\n* 14 - 5 = 9\n* 30 - 14 = 16\n* 55 - 30 = 25\n\nThese differences (4, 9, 16, 25) are all perfect squares:\n\n* 2\u00b2 = 4\n* 3\u00b2 = 9\n* 4\u00b2 = 16\n* 5\u00b2 = 25\n\n**2. Apply the Pattern:**\n\nThe pattern is:  **Each subsequent number is found by adding the square of the next consecutive odd number to the previous number.**\n\n*  1 + 2\u00b2 = 5\n*  5 + 3\u00b2 = 14\n*  14 + 4\u00b2 = 30\n*  30 + 5\u00b2 = 55\n\n**3. Find the Next Number:**\n\nTo find the next number, add the square of 6 (the next consecutive odd number) to the last number (55):\n\n* 55 + 6\u00b2 = 55 + 36 = 91\n\n**Therefore, the next number in the series is 91. The correct answer is option A.**\n\n**Key takeaways for solving similar questions:**\n\n* **Look for differences and patterns:**  Don't assume a simple arithmetic sequence.

Here's a breakdown of the solution to understand the logic:\n\n**1. Understanding the Goal:**\n\nThe company wants to achieve an average monthly sales figure of $170,000 for the entire first half of the year (January to June). This means the company needs to generate a total sales revenue of $170,000 x 6 months = $1,020,000 for the entire period.\n\n**2. Analyzing Existing Performance:**\n\nWe are given the sales figures for the first quarter (January to March). The total sales for the first quarter are $120,000 + $150,000 + $180,000 = $450,000.\n\n**3. Calculating the Required Sales:**\n\nTo reach the desired total sales of $1,020,000, the company needs to generate an additional $1,020,000 - $450,000 = $570,000 in the second quarter (April to June).\n\n**4. Finding the Average for the Second Quarter:**\n\nThe second quarter has 3 months. To achieve the required sales of $570,000, the company needs to average $570,000 / 3 months = $190,000 per month.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (b) $190,000.**\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(a) $190,000:** This is the minimum average required for the *second quarter* to meet the *half-year* goal. However, to achieve the overall target, the company needs to maintain this average throughout the second quarter, not just achieve it once.\n* **(c) $170,000:** This is the target average for the *entire* first half-year, not the specific average needed for the second quarter to meet the overall target.\n* **(d) $200,000:** This figure is too high. If the company averages $200,000 per month in the second quarter, their total sales for the first half-year will exceed their target. \n\n**Key takeaways and application:**\n\n* **Averages and Targets:** This question highlights the relationship between average, target, and total values. You need to be able to calculate the total required, adjust for existing performance, and then determine the average needed for a specific period.\n* **Break down the problem:**  Complex problems can be solved by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable steps.\n* **Practice similar questions:**  Banking exams often include questions on averages, ratios, and percentages.  Practice similar questions to enhance your understanding and develop your problem-solving skills.\n\nRemember, understanding the concepts and practicing regularly will help you ace these types of questions in your banking exams. \n",

This suggests that the given information is incorrect, making it impossible to calculate the 15th term accurately. \n\n**5. Importance of Consistency**\n\nThis question highlights the importance of consistency in sequence problems.  If a sequence is defined by a rule, each term must follow that rule.  Inaccurate information can lead to incorrect calculations and wrong answers. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDue to inconsistencies in the given information, it's impossible to determine the 15th term of this sequence with certainty.

Recognizing Series S:**\n\nSeries S is the famous Maclaurin series expansion of the exponential function **e^x** when x = 1.  The Maclaurin series is a special case of the Taylor series centered at x = 0.\n\n**Therefore, the sum of series S, T = e^1 = e.**\n\n**2. Analyzing Series R:**\n\nSeries R is constructed using the sum of series S (T).  Each term in R has the form (T^n)/n! which is strikingly similar to the general term of the Taylor series expansion of e^x, which is (x^n)/n!.\n\n**3. Connecting the dots:**\n\nSince the general term in R resembles the Taylor series expansion of e^x, we can express R as:\n\nR = e^T - 1 - T \n\n**Why is this true?** \n\nThe Taylor series expansion of e^x is:\n\ne^x = 1 + x + (x^2)/2! + (x^3)/3! + (x^4)/4! + ...\n\nNotice that R is missing the first two terms of the expansion (1 + x) when x = T.  Hence, R = e^T - 1 - T.\n\n**4. Final Calculation:**\n\nSubstituting T = e in the expression for R, we get:\n\nR = e^e - 1 - e\n\nR = (e^e)/2 - (e^2)/2\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C. (e^T)/2 - (T^2)/2**\n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Maclaurin Series:** Be familiar with the Maclaurin series expansion for common functions like e^x, sin(x), cos(x), etc. This helps in identifying and solving problems related to infinite series.\n* **Recognizing Patterns:** Pay attention to the structure of the series terms. If they resemble a known series expansion, you can use that knowledge to simplify the problem.\n* **Substitution and Simplification:**  Be comfortable with substituting values and simplifying expressions. In this case, we substituted T = e to arrive at the final answer.\n\nThis question tests your knowledge of series and their properties, specifically the Maclaurin series expansion.

These types of questions often involve multiple operations combined in a specific order to generate the sequence. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Pattern:**\n\nThe question states that the sequence follows a specific pattern:\n\n1. **Sum of Previous Two Numbers:**  Add the two preceding numbers in the sequence.\n2. **Double the Sum:** Multiply the sum by 2.\n3. **Add the Previous Number:** Add the last number of the sequence to the doubled sum.\n\n**Applying the Pattern:**\n\n1. **Finding the missing number:** To find the missing number, let's apply the pattern to the last three known numbers (63, 44, and 29):\n    * Sum of 63 and 44: 63 + 44 = 107\n    * Double the sum: 107 * 2 = 214\n    * Add the previous number: 214 + 63 = 277\n\n    This means the missing number in the sequence is **277**. \n\n2. **Finding the next number:** Since 277 is not one of the provided options, we need to continue the pattern to find the next number in the sequence. Let's use 277, 63, and 44:\n    * Sum of 277 and 63: 277 + 63 = 340\n    * Double the sum: 340 * 2 = 680\n    * Add the previous number: 680 + 277 = 957\n\n    This means the next number in the sequence is **957**. However, this number is not in the provided options.\n\n3. **The Correct Answer:** Since 957 is not a choice, the correct answer must be the element that comes *before* 957 in the sequence. This is calculated by applying the pattern to 277, 63, and 44:\n    * Sum of 63 and 44: 63 + 44 = 107\n    * Double the sum: 107 * 2 = 214\n    * Add the previous number: 214 + 63 = 277\n\n    Therefore, the next element in the sequence is **277**.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question provides us with a series of revenue figures for a company over five years. The goal is to determine the company's projected revenue for the sixth year, 2026.  To do this, we need to calculate the average annual growth rate over the past five years and then apply a projected growth rate for 2026, which is 10% higher than the average.\n\n**2. Calculating Revenue for each Year:**\n\n* **2022:**  The revenue increased by 15% from 2021, so the revenue for 2022 is calculated as: $10 million * 1.15 = $11.5 million\n* **2023:** The revenue increased by 12% from 2022, so the revenue for 2023 is calculated as: $11.5 million * 1.12 = $12.88 million\n* **2024:**  The revenue decreased by 5% from 2023, so the revenue for 2024 is calculated as: $12.88 million * 0.95 = $12.24 million\n* **2025:** The revenue increased by 8% from 2024, so the revenue for 2025 is calculated as: $12.24 million * 1.08 = $13.21 million\n\n**3. Calculating Total Revenue Growth:**\n\nTo determine the total revenue growth over the five years, subtract the initial revenue in 2021 from the revenue in 2025:\n* Total revenue increase = $13.21 million - $10 million = $3.21 million\n\n**4. Calculating Average Annual Growth Rate:**\n\nThe average annual growth rate is calculated by dividing the total revenue increase by the initial revenue and multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage:\n* Average growth rate = ($3.21 million / $10 million) * 100 = 32.1%\n\n**5. Calculating Projected Growth Rate for 2026:**\n\nThe projected growth rate for 2026 is 10% higher than the average growth rate:\n* Projected growth rate = 32.1% + 10% = 42.1%\n\n**6. Calculating Projected Revenue for 2026:**\n\nFinally, we calculate the projected revenue for 2026 by multiplying the 2025 revenue by 1 plus the projected growth rate:\n* Projected revenue = $13.21 million * 1.421 = $18.78 million (approximately)\n\n**7. Selecting the Closest Option:**\n\nThe options provided are rounded, and the closest answer to our calculated $18.78 million is **(D) 17.3 million**. \n\n**Important Points for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Percentage Calculations:** This question heavily relies on percentage calculations.  Master the concept of percentage increase and decrease, and how to convert them to decimal form for multiplication.\n* **Understanding Growth Rates:**  Understanding how to calculate average growth rates and applying them to future projections is crucial for financial analysis.\n* **Approximations:** Since the options are rounded, you need to be comfortable with approximations and selecting the closest answer.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Financial Analysis:** This question is an example of basic financial analysis used to understand a company's performance and project future growth.\n* **Growth Trends:** Understanding revenue growth trends can help companies make strategic decisions about investment, expansion, and resource allocation.\n\nThis explanation will help you understand the concepts required to solve similar problems on the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams.

Data Interpretation and Calculation:**\n\n* **Profit Margin:** This is a key metric calculated as (Profit / Revenue) * 100%. It reflects the percentage of profit generated for each dollar of revenue.\n* **Average Profit Margin:** The question emphasizes maintaining the overall profitability, which is determined by the average profit margin of all products. We calculate the average profit margin by summing the individual profit margins and dividing by the number of products.\n* **Desired Profit Margin for Product D:**  The company wants Product D to achieve at least the average profit margin calculated earlier. This sets a benchmark for the new product's performance.\n* **Desired Profit per Unit:** This is calculated by multiplying the desired profit margin with the selling price of Product D. This figure represents the target profit the company wants to make on each unit of Product D.\n\n**3. The Formula and Calculation:**\n\nThe solution utilizes a basic profit calculation formula to determine the number of units needed to achieve the desired profit margin. The formula is:\n\n* **Units to sell = (Total Fixed Costs + (Desired Profit per Unit * Number of Units of Product D)) / (Selling Price - Production Cost)**\n\nThe formula accounts for:\n\n* **Fixed Costs:** These are costs that remain constant regardless of the production volume. The question doesn't explicitly mention fixed costs; however, the solution assumes a fixed cost of $10,000. This assumption might be provided in the actual exam question. \n* **Desired Profit per Unit:** This is the target profit margin calculated earlier.\n* **Selling Price & Production Cost:** These are given in the question, representing the revenue and cost per unit of Product D.\n\nBy plugging in the known values and solving for the unknown number of units (X), the solution arrives at the answer: 900 units.\n\n**4. Relevance to IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Data Interpretation:** The question tests your ability to extract relevant information from the given data, perform calculations, and interpret the results. This is a crucial skill for bank exams, as they often involve analyzing financial statements and market trends.\n* **Financial Concepts:** The question tests your understanding of profit margin and its application in business decision-making. \n* **Problem-Solving:** It requires you to apply a formula, perform logical calculations, and arrive at a practical solution. These are essential skills for any banking role.\n\n**5. Additional Context:**\n\nThe question could be made more complex by introducing:\n\n* **Variable Costs:** These costs change with the production volume. For example, raw materials cost could increase with higher production.\n* **Sales Projections:** The question could provide sales forecasts or demand estimations, which would influence the unit sales calculation.\n* **Competitor Analysis:** The question could introduce information about competitor pricing and market share, which could further influence the company's pricing and sales strategy.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* This question emphasizes the importance of profit margin as a key performance indicator for businesses.\n* Understanding the various financial concepts and data interpretation skills is vital for success in bank exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n* The ability to solve practical problems using relevant formulas and information is crucial for banking professionals.\n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Correct Answer:\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of getting a run of exactly three consecutive points before a run of exactly five consecutive non-points in an infinite sequence of dice rolls. Here's a breakdown of why the correct answer is **C) 1/126** and why the other options are incorrect:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Fair Die:** Each face of the die has an equal probability of appearing (1/6).\n* **Consecutive Points:**  We need a sequence where three '6's appear consecutively *before* five non-'6's appear consecutively.\n* **Infinite Sequence:** We need to consider all possible sequences that could extend infinitely.\n\n**The Recursive Approach:**\n\nThe solution uses a recursive approach to calculate the probability. This means we break the problem into smaller, similar subproblems.\n\n1. **Base Case:** We start with the probability of satisfying the condition in the first three rolls (`P_3`). Since it's impossible to have either run within three rolls, `P_3 = 0`.\n\n2. **Recursive Step:** We consider the probability of satisfying the condition after the fourth roll, `P_4`. This is where the recursion comes in:\n\n    * **Case 1: Fourth roll is a point.** This can only happen if the first three rolls weren't all non-points. The probability of this is `(1 - (5/6)^3) = 91/216`.  In this case, the probability of satisfying the condition from here on is the same as the probability of satisfying it from the previous roll, `P_3`.\n    * **Case 2: Fourth roll is a non-point, and the first three rolls aren't all points.** This happens with probability `(5/6) * (1 - (1/6)^3) = 245/216`. Again, the probability of satisfying the condition from here on is `P_3`.\n    * **Case 3: Fourth roll is a non-point, and the first three rolls are all points.** This happens with probability `(5/6)^4 = 625/1296`. In this case, we have achieved our goal - we have a run of three points before a run of five non-points.\n    * **Case 4: Fourth roll is a non-point, and the first three rolls are not all points but contain one point.** This happens with probability `(5/6)^3 * (1/6) * 3 = 125/1296`. The probability of satisfying the condition from here on is `P_3`.\n\n3. **Combining the Cases:** We sum the probabilities of all these cases to get the probability of satisfying the condition after the fourth roll:\n\n    `P_4 = (91/216)P_3 + (245/216)P_3 + (625/1296) + (125/1296) = (336/216)P_3 + (750/1296)`\n\n4. **General Recursion:** We can generalize this for any number of rolls `n`:\n\n    `P_n = (336/216)P_{n-1} + (750/1296)`\n\n5. **Solving the Recursion:** We use the base case `P_3 = 0` and solve the recursion. The solution to this recursion is:\n\n    `P_n = (1/126)(1 - (336/216)^n)`\n\n6. **Limit as n approaches infinity:** As the number of rolls increases indefinitely (approaches infinity), the term `(336/216)^n` approaches 0. Therefore, the probability `P_n` converges to **1/126**.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A) 1/62:** This option only considers the probability of getting three consecutive points without considering the possibility of having a run of five consecutive non-points before.\n* **B) 1/63:** This option only considers the probability of getting three consecutive points without considering the possibility of having a run of five consecutive non-points before.\n* **D) 1/252:** This option only considers the probability of getting five consecutive non-points without considering the possibility of getting three consecutive points before.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of problem tests your ability to apply probability concepts and think logically. It's relevant to banking exams as they often require you to analyze scenarios involving probabilities and make informed decisions based on statistical data. The question tests your ability to:\n\n* **Break down complex problems into smaller parts:** This is crucial in financial analysis.\n* **Use recursive thinking:**  Many financial calculations involve iterative processes.\n* **Understand and apply basic probability concepts:** This is fundamental to risk assessment and decision-making in the banking industry.\n\n**Practice Tip:**\n\nPractice similar questions involving probability and sequences to improve your understanding of these concepts and your problem-solving skills. This will help you confidently tackle similar questions on banking exams. \n",
