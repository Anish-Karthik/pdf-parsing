            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe answer is **(a) True**. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Negation**\n\nIn logic, the negation of a statement simply means making it the opposite. We use the word \"not\" to express negation. \n\n* **Original Statement:**  \"The sun is a planet.\"  (This is false)\n* **Negated Statement:** \"The sun is **not** a planet.\"\n\n**Truth Value and Contradiction**\n\n* **Truth Value:**  A statement is either true or false. \n* **Contradiction:** When a statement and its negation have opposite truth values, they contradict each other.\n\n**Applying the Logic**\n\nSince the original statement \"The sun is a planet\" is false, its negation \"The sun is not a planet\" must be true.  This is because a statement and its negation cannot both be true or both be false at the same time.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams**\n\nThis concept of truth values and negations is fundamental to logical reasoning, which is tested in various sections of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's how it's relevant:\n\n* **Logical Reasoning:**  Understanding the truth values of statements and their negations helps in solving logical puzzles, syllogisms, and deductive reasoning questions. \n* **Data Interpretation:**  Analyzing data often requires understanding the relationship between statements and their negations.\n* **Verbal Reasoning:**  Analyzing arguments and identifying fallacies relies on understanding the logic of statements and their opposites.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say you are given a statement in a data interpretation question: \"All bank employees are graduates.\"  You can then use your understanding of negations to conclude: \"Not all bank employees are graduates.\"  This logical deduction can help you interpret the data accurately. \n\n**In essence, mastering the concept of negations and their truth values is crucial for excelling in reasoning-based sections of banking exams.** \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Biconditional Statements:**\n\nThe question uses a biconditional statement, often represented with the symbol \"\u2194\".  A biconditional statement is true only when both parts of the statement have the same truth value (both true or both false).  In this case, the statement is:\n\n* **Person is eligible to vote \u2194 Person is 18 years old or older**\n\n**Analyzing the Information:**\n\n1. We know Sarah is 22 years old.\n2. This means Sarah is **older** than 18 years old.\n3. Since Sarah meets the condition of being 18 years old or older, the right side of the biconditional statement is **True**.\n4. Because both sides of the biconditional statement are true (Sarah meets the age requirement, and the statement says someone is eligible to vote if they meet that requirement), the entire statement is **True**. \n\n**Why this is important for banking exams:**\n\nUnderstanding biconditional statements is crucial for logical reasoning sections in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams often test your ability to analyze and interpret complex statements, including those with logical connectives like \"if and only if\" (biconditional). Being able to break down the information, identify the truth values, and apply the rules of biconditional statements is essential for answering these types of questions accurately.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Biconditional statements require both sides to have the same truth value to be true.**\n* **Analyze the given information carefully to determine the truth values of each part of the statement.**\n* **Apply the rules of logical connectives to determine the overall truth value of the statement.**\n\nBy mastering these concepts, you can confidently tackle logical reasoning questions in your banking exams and increase your chances of success. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **B) The light turns OFF.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n**Understanding the NOT Operator**\n\nThe NOT operator is a fundamental concept in logic and computer science. It essentially reverses the truth value of a statement. If a statement is true, the NOT operator makes it false, and vice-versa.\n\n**Applying it to the Light Switch Scenario**\n\n1. **Initial State:** The light is ON.  This is considered **TRUE**.\n2. **NOT Operator:** You flip the switch, which is equivalent to applying the NOT operator.\n3. **Result:** The NOT operator inverts the truth value. Since the light was ON (TRUE), applying NOT makes it OFF (FALSE).\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A) The light stays ON:**  This is incorrect because the NOT operator always inverts the truth value.\n* **C) The light flickers:**  Flickering suggests a change in the light's intensity, not a simple on/off state.\n* **D) The light might turn on or off, it's unpredictable:**  The NOT operator is deterministic. It always produces a predictable output based on the input.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding logic operators like NOT is crucial for these banking exams, particularly in sections like reasoning and data interpretation. These operators are used to solve problems involving conditional statements, data analysis, and logical deduction. \n\n**Here's why this knowledge is valuable for banking exams:**\n\n* **Reasoning Ability:** Many reasoning questions involve understanding logical relationships and drawing conclusions. The NOT operator helps you analyze and manipulate these relationships.\n* **Data Interpretation:** Analyzing data often involves filtering and comparing information based on certain criteria. Understanding the NOT operator helps you interpret data accurately.\n* **Problem Solving:**  Many problem-solving questions involve applying logical steps to reach a solution.  The NOT operator helps you make accurate deductions and avoid errors.\n\n**In conclusion**,  mastering the NOT operator and its application in various scenarios will strengthen your analytical skills and improve your performance in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of conditional probability, a crucial concept for quantitative aptitude sections in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Let's break down the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a person liking apples *given* that they already like oranges. This is a conditional probability problem, where we're looking at the probability of one event happening (liking apples) *given* that another event has already happened (liking oranges).\n\n**Key Formula**\n\nThe formula for conditional probability is:\n\nP(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nWhere:\n\n* P(A | B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened.\n* P(A and B) is the probability of both events A and B happening.\n* P(B) is the probability of event B happening.\n\n**Applying the Formula to our Problem**\n\n* **Event A:** Liking apples\n* **Event B:** Liking oranges\n\nWe need to find:\n\n* **P(Apples | Oranges):** The probability of liking apples given that the person likes oranges.\n* **P(Apples and Oranges):** The probability of liking both apples and oranges. This is given as 20/100 (20 people like both out of 100).\n* **P(Oranges):** The probability of liking oranges. This is given as 40/100 (40 people like oranges out of 100).\n\n**Calculation**\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nP(Apples | Oranges) = P(Apples and Oranges) / P(Oranges) \nP(Apples | Oranges) = (20/100) / (40/100) \nP(Apples | Oranges) = 20/40 = 0.5\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (b) 0.5.**\n\n**Why it's Important for Banking Exams**\n\nUnderstanding conditional probability is essential in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Many questions related to data analysis, risk assessment, and financial decision-making rely on this concept. You might encounter scenarios involving loan approvals, investment strategies, or customer behavior analysis, all of which require the ability to calculate conditional probabilities.\n\n**Learning Tip:**\n\nPractice similar problems with different scenarios and data sets to strengthen your understanding.  Remember to clearly identify the events and their probabilities before applying the formula. You can also utilize Venn diagrams to visualize the relationships between different events and their probabilities. \n",

Truth Tables for Conditional Statements:**\n\nA truth table shows the truth value (True or False) of a statement for all possible combinations of truth values of its components. For a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\", the truth table looks like this:\n\n| P | Q | P \u2192 Q |\n|---|---|---|\n| T | T | T |\n| T | F | F |\n| F | T | T |\n| F | F | T |\n\n**Explanation of the truth table:**\n\n* **Row 1 (T, T):**  If it is raining (true) and the ground is wet (true), the statement is true. \n* **Row 2 (T, F):** If it is raining (true) but the ground is not wet (false), the statement is **false**. This is because the statement claims the ground *must* be wet if it's raining.\n* **Row 3 (F, T):** If it's not raining (false) but the ground is wet (true), the statement is still true. The statement only promises a wet ground *if* it's raining, it doesn't say anything about what happens when it's not raining.\n* **Row 4 (F, F):** If it's not raining (false) and the ground is not wet (false), the statement is true. The statement doesn't make any claims about the ground when it's not raining.\n\n**3.

Let's break it down:\n\n**Understanding the Original Statement:**\n\nThe original statement is: \"Sarah is going to the park, and she is bringing her dog with her.\"  This is a conjunction, meaning both parts must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\n**The Negation:**\n\nThe question tells us that the original statement is **not true**. This means at least one of the parts must be false. In logical terms, we are looking for the negation of the conjunction.\n\n**Negation of Conjunction:**\n\nThe negation of a conjunction is a disjunction. This means we change the \"and\" to an \"or\".  The negation of \"A and B\" is \"not A or not B\". \n\n**Applying to the Problem:**\n\n* **Original Statement:** Sarah is going to the park (A) and she is bringing her dog (B).\n* **Negation:**  Not (Sarah is going to the park) or not (she is bringing her dog). \n\n**Why Option C is Correct:**\n\nOption C, \"Sarah is not going to the park or she is not bringing her dog with her\", accurately reflects this negation. It says that either Sarah is not going to the park, or she is not bringing her dog, or possibly both. This ensures the original statement is false, as at least one part must be false.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A:** \"Sarah is not going to the park and she is not bringing her dog with her.\" This is a conjunction, and it's not the negation of the original statement.  It's possible for the original statement to be false even if Sarah is not bringing her dog, but still going to the park.\n* **Option B:** \"Sarah is going to the park and she is not bringing her dog with her.\" This statement contradicts the negation. The original statement is false, meaning Sarah is not going to the park or not bringing her dog, not both.\n* **Option D:** \"Sarah is not going to the park, but she is bringing her dog with her.\" This statement implies that Sarah is bringing her dog but not going to the park, which contradicts the original statement.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nOption C is the only option that accurately represents the negation of the original statement. By understanding the rules of negation and applying them to conjunctions, you can effectively analyze and negate compound statements. \n",

Understanding Logical Equivalence:**\n\nTwo logical statements are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value for all possible combinations of truth values of their component propositions.  In simpler terms, they always have the same outcome regardless of whether their constituent parts are true or false.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Truth Table of 'p \u2192 q':**\n\nThe truth table for 'p \u2192 q' shows the following:\n\n* **T \u2192 T = T:** If both p and q are true, the implication is true.\n* **T \u2192 F = F:** If p is true but q is false, the implication is false.\n* **F \u2192 T = T:** If p is false, the implication is true regardless of the truth value of q. \n* **F \u2192 F = T:** If both p and q are false, the implication is true.\n\n**3.

This does not match the truth table of 'p \u2192 q'.\n* **(d) \u00ac(p \u2227 \u00acq):** This statement is true when either p is false or q is true (or both). While this matches some of the outcomes of 'p \u2192 q', it is not equivalent as the truth values do not align in all cases. \n\n**Key takeaway:**\n\nUnderstanding how to construct and interpret truth tables is crucial for determining logical equivalence. This skill is essential for solving problems involving logical reasoning and deduction, which are commonly tested in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n\n**Additional context for exam preparation:**\n\n* **Practice**:  Practice solving various problems involving truth tables and logical equivalence. Familiarize yourself with common logical connectives (AND, OR, NOT, IMPLICATION, etc.) and their truth tables.\n* **Understanding the language:**  Pay attention to the wording of questions and how they relate to logical concepts.  For example, statements like \"if p then q\" are directly translated into \"p \u2192 q\".\n* **Review basic logic concepts:**  Refresh your knowledge of basic logical concepts like propositions, truth values, logical operators, and logical equivalence.\n* **Use resources**:  Utilize online resources, textbooks, and practice materials designed for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams to further your understanding of these topics. \n",

Let's break down the answer:\n\n**Why \"A. Sarah definitely has a medical license.\" is the correct answer:**\n\n* **Conditional Statements:** These statements have the form \"If P, then Q\".  \n    * P is called the **antecedent** (the condition) and Q is called the **consequent** (the result). \n    * The statement implies that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. \n* **Applying the rule:**  In this case, \"Sarah is a doctor\" (P) is true, and the statement tells us that if someone is a doctor (P), they must have a medical license (Q). Therefore, we can confidently conclude that \"Sarah has a medical license\" (Q) is also true.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **B. Sarah might have a medical license, but we can't be sure.** This is incorrect because the conditional statement establishes a definite link between being a doctor and having a medical license.\n* **C. Sarah definitely does not have a medical license.** This directly contradicts the given information and the logic of the conditional statement.\n* **D.

(If someone doesn't have a medical license, then they are not a doctor.)  This statement is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement and is always true.\n\n* **Logical Reasoning in Exams:**  Logical reasoning questions test your ability to analyze and interpret information, identify patterns, and draw valid conclusions.

This fallacy occurs when an argument assumes that if the first part of a conditional statement is false, then the second part must also be false. Let's break this down:\n\n**Understanding the Argument:**\n\nThe argument presents a conditional statement: **\"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\"** This statement implies that if it is raining, the ground will be wet. However, it doesn't state that the ground being wet *only* happens when it is raining. \n\nThe argument then states that **\"It is not raining.\"** This is the denial of the antecedent (the \"if\" part of the conditional statement).\n\nFinally, it concludes that **\"Therefore, the ground is not wet.\"** This conclusion is where the fallacy lies.  \n\n**Why the Conclusion is Invalid:**\n\nThe conclusion is invalid because the ground could be wet for other reasons besides rain. For example:\n\n* **Sprinklers:** The ground might be wet due to sprinklers.\n* **Recent Rain:** It may have rained earlier, and the ground is still wet.\n* **Other Sources:** The ground could be wet due to a leak, a spilled bucket of water, etc.\n\n**Truth Tables and Validity:**\n\nTo understand this further, we can use a truth table. A truth table shows all possible combinations of truth values for the premises and the conclusion of an argument.  \n\nHere's the truth table for this argument:\n\n| Raining (P) | Ground Wet (Q) | If P then Q | Not P | Therefore, not Q |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| True | True | True | False | False |\n| True | False | False | False | True |\n| False | True | True | True | False |\n| False | False | True | True | True |\n\n**Explanation of the Truth Table:**\n\n* **Row 1:** If it is raining (P = True) and the ground is wet (Q = True), the conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is True. Denying the antecedent (not P = False) would lead to a false conclusion (\"Therefore, not Q\" = False). This shows the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow.\n* **Row 3:** If it is not raining (P = False) but the ground is wet (Q = True), the conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is still True.  Denying the antecedent (not P = True) would lead to a false conclusion (\"Therefore, not Q\" = False). This again shows the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow.\n\n**The key takeaway is that the argument is invalid because it incorrectly assumes that denying the antecedent automatically makes the consequent false.**\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding logical fallacies, including denying the antecedent, is crucial for critical thinking and problem-solving, skills that are essential for banking exams. \n\n* **Reasoning Ability:** The IBPS PO and SBI PO exams assess candidates' reasoning abilities. This type of question tests the ability to identify logical fallacies and understand the principles of valid arguments.\n* **Data Interpretation:** Many banking exam questions require analyzing data and drawing conclusions.  Being able to identify faulty reasoning prevents misinterpretations and helps draw accurate conclusions. \n\nBy understanding the concepts of conditional statements, truth tables, and common logical fallacies, you can improve your performance in the reasoning section of these banking exams. \n",

In logic, conditional statements are written in the form \"If p, then q\", where:\n\n* **p** is called the **antecedent**: This is the condition or premise.\n* **q** is called the **consequent**: This is the result or conclusion.\n\nIn our statement:\n\n* **Antecedent (p):** The stock market is up (S) AND interest rates are low (I). \n* **Consequent (q):** The economy is strong (E).\n\n**Truth Table and the Conditional Statement:**\n\nA truth table helps analyze the truth value of a statement based on the truth values of its components. For a conditional statement, the only scenario where it's considered **false** is when the antecedent (p) is true, and the consequent (q) is false. In all other scenarios, the statement is considered **true**.\n\n**Analyzing the Given Truth Table:**\n\nThe first row of the truth table shows S and I are both true (T, T).  The statement says if S AND I are true, then E must also be true.  Since we don't have any information contradicting this, we must assume that E is true in this scenario. \n\n**Why the answer is (a) T:**\n\nThe given truth table tells us that S and I are both true (T, T). Based on the conditional statement, the only way the statement can remain true is if E is also true. Therefore, the correct answer is **(a) T**.\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Conditional Statements:** Understand the structure and truth value of conditional statements.\n* **Truth Tables:**  Practice constructing truth tables for different types of logical statements.\n* **Logical Reasoning:**  Focus on analyzing arguments and identifying valid and invalid conclusions.\n\n**By understanding these concepts, you will be well-equipped to solve logical reasoning questions that appear in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.** \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **A) All elements of A are also in C, and C may contain elements not in A.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Understanding Subsets:** A subset means that all elements of the smaller set are also present in the larger set.  It's like a smaller box fitting entirely within a bigger box.\n\n* **The Given Information:**  We are told that A is a subset of B (A \u2286 B) and B is a subset of C (B \u2286 C).\n\n* **Applying the Logic:**\n\n   *  Since A is a subset of B, every element in A is also present in B.\n   *  Since B is a subset of C, every element in B is also present in C.\n\n   Therefore, combining these two statements, we can conclude: **Every element in A is also present in C.**\n\n* **Why Option A is Correct:**\n\n   * **\"All elements of A are also in C\"** is directly derived from the subset relationship.\n   * **\"C may contain elements not in A\"** is true because C is the largest set. It can contain elements that are not present in either A or B. \n\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n   * **B) A, B, and C are mutually exclusive sets:** This is incorrect because subsets imply that sets share elements. If sets are mutually exclusive, they have no common elements.\n   * **C) A, B, and C have an equal number of elements:** This is incorrect because subsets can have different numbers of elements. The larger set can have more elements.\n   * **D) C is a subset of B, and B is a subset of A:** This is incorrect. It reverses the given information. We are told that A is a subset of B, not the other way around. \n\n**In essence, the subset relationship creates a hierarchical structure. If A is a subset of B, and B is a subset of C, then A is also a subset of C.**\n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\nThis concept of subsets is crucial for many logical reasoning questions, especially in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. It helps you analyze relationships between sets and draw logical conclusions. You can apply this knowledge to questions involving:\n\n* **Set Operations:**  Understanding subsets helps you identify elements in the union, intersection, or difference of sets.\n* **Venn Diagrams:**  Visualizing subsets using Venn diagrams can help you solve problems related to set theory.\n* **Logical Deductions:**  By identifying subset relationships, you can make logical deductions about the elements present in each set.\n\nRemember to practice with various examples to solidify your understanding.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **b) AND**. Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question asks you to find employees who are assigned to **both** 'Project A' and 'Project B'.  This implies we need a logical operation that checks if *both* conditions are true.\n\n**Truth Tables and Database Queries:**\n\n* **Truth tables** are used to represent logical operations.  They show the outcome (True or False) based on different combinations of input conditions.\n* **Database queries** use logical operators like AND, OR, NOT to filter data based on specific criteria. \n\n**Why AND is Correct:**\n\nThe **AND** operation in a truth table returns **True** only when *all* input conditions are **True**. \n\n* Imagine our database has a table called \"Employee_Projects\" that stores which project each employee is assigned to.\n* We want to find employees who appear in the table *twice*, once for 'Project A' and once for 'Project B'.\n* The 'AND' operator ensures that only employees who satisfy *both* conditions (assigned to 'Project A' and assigned to 'Project B') are included in the final result.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **OR:**  The 'OR' operator would return employees assigned to *either* Project A or Project B or both.  This wouldn't give us the specific group we're looking for.\n* **XOR:** The 'XOR' (Exclusive OR) operator returns True only if *one* condition is true, and the other is false. This would return employees assigned to *only one* project, not both.\n* **NOT:** The 'NOT' operator negates a condition.  It wouldn't be useful in this scenario, as we want to confirm a positive condition (being assigned to both projects).\n\n**Example SQL Query:**\n\nAssuming the database table \"Employee_Projects\" has columns \"EmployeeID\" and \"ProjectName\", the query would look something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT EmployeeID\nFROM Employee_Projects\nWHERE ProjectName = 'Project A'\nAND ProjectName = 'Project B';\n```\n\nThis query will return the EmployeeIDs of employees who have records in the \"Employee_Projects\" table for both 'Project A' and 'Project B'.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question tests your understanding of basic database concepts and logical operations.  The ability to translate real-world requirements into logical expressions using AND, OR, NOT is crucial for writing efficient database queries.  These skills are important for banking roles, where you might be involved in data analysis, report generation, and system management. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Scenario:**\n\nThe smart home lighting system has two conditions for turning on the lights:\n\n1. **Motion detected (Sensor A):** This can be represented as a binary input, where 1 signifies motion detected and 0 signifies no motion.\n2. **Darkness detected (Sensor B):**  This can be represented as a binary input, where 1 signifies darkness and 0 signifies light.\n\nThe lights only turn on when **both** conditions are true: motion AND darkness.\n\n**Logic Gates and their Functions:**\n\n* **AND Gate:** The AND gate outputs a 1 (true) only when **all** of its inputs are 1 (true).  If any input is 0 (false), the output is 0 (false).\n* **OR Gate:** The OR gate outputs a 1 (true) when **at least one** of its inputs is 1 (true).\n* **XOR Gate:** The XOR gate outputs a 1 (true) when **only one** of its inputs is 1 (true). If both inputs are 1 or both inputs are 0, the output is 0 (false).\n* **NOT Gate:** The NOT gate inverts the input. If the input is 1, the output is 0, and vice-versa.\n\n**Applying Logic to the Scenario:**\n\nThe smart home system's behavior perfectly aligns with the AND gate's function. Only when both sensors (A and B) detect their respective conditions (motion and darkness), represented by 1s, will the AND gate output a 1, turning the lights on.\n\n**Example:**\n\n| Sensor A (Motion) | Sensor B (Darkness) | AND Gate Output (Lights) |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 |  (No motion, light)\n| 0 | 1 | 0 |  (No motion, dark)\n| 1 | 0 | 0 |  (Motion, light)\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |  (Motion, dark)\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThese types of logic gate questions are frequently encountered in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. The exams test your analytical and problem-solving skills, and understanding logic gates is crucial for solving these questions. \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Logic gates are essential for understanding digital circuits and computer programming.\n* The AND gate plays a crucial role in situations where all conditions must be met. \n* Practice identifying the correct logic gate based on given conditions. \n* Familiarity with truth tables for each gate is essential for accurate problem-solving. \n",

Let's break down the answer and the reasoning behind it:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question describes a security system with three sensors (A, B, and C). The alarm triggers only when:\n\n* **Either sensor A or sensor B is activated (A OR B)**\n* **AND sensor C is also activated (AND C)**\n\nThis logic can be represented using a Boolean expression: **(A OR B) AND C**\n\n**Truth Table Explanation:**\n\nA truth table is a systematic way to evaluate all possible combinations of inputs (sensors being activated or deactivated) and their corresponding outputs (alarm sounding or not). \n\nHere's a simplified truth table for this scenario:\n\n| A | B | C | (A OR B) | (A OR B) AND C | Alarm |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| T | T | T | T | T | Sounds |\n| T | T | F | T | F | Silent |\n| T | F | T | T | T | Sounds |\n| T | F | F | T | F | Silent |\n| F | T | T | T | T | Sounds |\n| F | T | F | T | F | Silent |\n| F | F | T | F | F | Silent |\n| F | F | F | F | F | Silent |\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n* **Option A (T, T, T):** Both A and B are activated, and C is activated. This satisfies the condition '(A OR B) AND C', resulting in the alarm sounding.\n* **Option B (T, F, T):** Sensor A is activated, B is deactivated, but C is activated. Again, the condition '(A OR B) AND C' is true, triggering the alarm.\n* **Option C (F, T, T):** Sensor A is deactivated, B is activated, and C is activated. This satisfies the condition '(A OR B) AND C', causing the alarm to sound.\n* **Option D (F, F, T):** Both A and B are deactivated, but C is activated.  This doesn't satisfy the condition '(A OR B) AND C'. Since both A and B are false, the expression '(A OR B)' is false, making the entire expression false. Therefore, the alarm won't sound.\n\n**Why Option D is Correct:**\n\nThe alarm system requires at least one of the sensors A or B to be activated alongside sensor C. Option D has both A and B deactivated, even though C is activated. This means the \"OR\" part of the logic is false, making the entire expression false, preventing the alarm from sounding. \n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\n* **Boolean Logic is Crucial:**  Understanding Boolean logic is vital for many banking exam topics, including data interpretation, computer aptitude, and even reasoning sections.\n* **Truth Tables are Your Friend:**  Learn to construct and analyze truth tables to systematically evaluate logical expressions. \n* **Practice Makes Perfect:**  Solving similar practice problems will help you grasp the concepts better and confidently apply them in the exam.\n\nBy understanding the principles of Boolean logic and truth tables, you can tackle these types of questions effectively and improve your score in banking exams. \n",

The statement (p \u2227 q) is true only when *both* p and q are true.\n\n* **Analyzing the Truth Table:** Let's examine the provided truth table:\n\n    | p | q | p \u2227 q | \u00ac(p \u2227 q) |\n    |---|---|---|---|\n    | T | T | T | F | \n    | T | F | F | T | \n    | F | T | F | T | \n    | F | F | F | T |\n\n    Notice that in every row, the truth value of \u00ac(p \u2227 q) is the exact opposite of the truth value of (p \u2227 q). When (p \u2227 q) is true, \u00ac(p \u2227 q) is false, and vice-versa.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The truth table clearly demonstrates that \u00ac(p \u2227 q) always has the opposite truth value of (p \u2227 q). This is because the negation operator flips the truth value of the statement it precedes.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A) \u00ac(p \u2227 q) is true only when (p \u2227 q) is true.**  This is incorrect because the table shows that \u00ac(p \u2227 q) is true when (p \u2227 q) is false.\n* **B) \u00ac(p \u2227 q) is true only when (p \u2227 q) is false.**  This is partially correct, but it doesn't fully describe the relationship. \u00ac(p \u2227 q) is also false when (p \u2227 q) is true.\n* **C) \u00ac(p \u2227 q) is always the same truth value as (p \u2227 q).** This is incorrect.  As explained above, the negation operator always inverts the truth value.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding truth tables and logical operators like negation and conjunction is crucial for various banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These concepts are often tested in reasoning sections, which assess candidates' ability to analyze and interpret logical statements.  \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Negation (\u00ac) flips the truth value of a statement.\n* Conjunction (\u2227) is true only when both statements are true.\n* Truth tables are a powerful tool for understanding the relationship between logical statements. \n* By understanding these basic logical concepts, you can successfully tackle reasoning questions in banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of truth tables and conditional statements, a crucial concept in logic and philosophy.  Here's a breakdown of why the correct answer is **C**:\n\n**Understanding the Proposition:**\n\nThe proposition \"If there are no objective moral truths, then morality is entirely subjective\" is a conditional statement. It takes the form of \"If P, then Q,\" where:\n\n* **P:** There are no objective moral truths.\n* **Q:** Morality is entirely subjective.\n\n**Truth Tables and Conditional Statements:**\n\nA truth table is a visual representation of how a proposition's truth value changes depending on the truth values of its constituent parts. In the case of a conditional statement (If P, then Q), the truth table looks like this:\n\n| P | Q | P \u2192 Q |\n|---|---|---|\n| T | T | T |\n| T | F | F |\n| F | T | T |\n| F | F | T |\n\n**Interpreting the Truth Table:**\n\nLet's analyze each row of the table:\n\n* **Row 1 (T \u2192 T):** If P is true (there are no objective moral truths) and Q is true (morality is entirely subjective), then the proposition is true.\n* **Row 2 (T \u2192 F):** If P is true (there are no objective moral truths) but Q is false (morality is not entirely subjective), then the proposition is false.\n* **Row 3 (F \u2192 T):** If P is false (there are objective moral truths) and Q is true (morality is entirely subjective), then the proposition is true. This might seem counterintuitive, but the conditional statement only claims that if there are no objective moral truths, then morality is subjective. It doesn't say anything about the case where there are objective moral truths.\n* **Row 4 (F \u2192 F):** If P is false (there are objective moral truths) and Q is false (morality is not entirely subjective), then the proposition is true.  Again, the conditional statement only claims that if there are no objective moral truths, then morality is subjective. It doesn't make a claim about what happens when there are objective moral truths.\n\n**Why Option C is Correct:**\n\nThe table shows that the proposition is true in three out of four scenarios. It's true when P is true and Q is true, when P is false and Q is true, and when P is false and Q is false. This means the proposition is true if **either** there are no objective moral truths **or** morality is entirely subjective, **or both**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A** is incorrect because it only considers the scenario where both P and Q are true.\n* **Option B** is incorrect because the proposition is true even when there are objective moral truths (P = F).\n* **Option D** is incorrect because the proposition is false when there are no objective moral truths and morality is not entirely subjective (P = T, Q = F).\n\n**Relevance for IBPS PO, SBI PO Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile this concept might not directly appear in the exam as a standalone question, understanding logic and truth tables is crucial for:\n\n* **Data Interpretation and Analysis:** Truth tables help in analyzing complex data relationships.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** Many questions in reasoning sections involve understanding conditional statements and their implications.\n* **Problem-solving:**  The ability to break down complex statements into logical components is essential for effective problem-solving.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThe question delves into the philosophical debate about morality. The existence of objective moral truths is a long-standing question with various philosophical perspectives. Understanding this debate can help you understand the context of the proposition and its potential implications.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* A conditional statement (If P, then Q) is only false when P is true and Q is false.\n* Truth tables are powerful tools for analyzing logical propositions.\n* Understanding logical reasoning is crucial for various aspects of competitive exams, even if the question doesn't explicitly mention truth tables. \n",

We are given a truth table that helps us understand the relationships between liking apples ('A'), liking oranges ('B'), liking both ('A \u2229 B'), and liking at least one ('A \u222a B').\n\n**Understanding the Truth Table:**\n\n* **A \u2229 B (A and B):** This column represents the intersection of liking apples and oranges.  A 'T' indicates someone likes both fruits.\n* **A \u222a B (A or B):** This column represents the union of liking apples or oranges or both. A 'T' indicates someone likes at least one of the fruits.\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n* **Option A) 40 people like only apples:** This is **TRUE**. We can find this by subtracting the number of people who like both (20) from the total number of people who like apples (60): 60 - 20 = 40.\n* **Option B) 30 people like only oranges:** This is also **TRUE**. We can find this by subtracting the number of people who like both (20) from the total number of people who like oranges (50): 50 - 20 = 30.\n* **Option C) 100 people like either apples or oranges or both:** This is **FALSE**. The statement incorrectly assumes that all 100 people in the survey like either apples or oranges. The truth table and survey data show that 90 people like either apples or oranges or both, not 100. \n    * We find this by adding the number of people who like apples (60) and the number of people who like oranges (50), then subtracting the number of people who like both (20) to avoid double-counting: 60 + 50 - 20 = 90. \n* **Option D) 80 people like apples or oranges but not both:** This is **TRUE**.  We know 90 people like apples or oranges, and 20 like both. Subtracting the overlap (those who like both) from the total who like at least one gives us 90 - 20 = 70.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **Option C) 100 people like either apples or oranges or both** because it contradicts the provided data. The truth table and survey results indicate that only 90 people like apples, oranges, or both.\n\n**Key takeaway for exam preparation:**\n\n*  Understanding truth tables and their connection to Venn Diagrams is crucial for analyzing data and solving problems related to sets and logic.\n*  Pay close attention to the meaning of 'intersection' (A \u2229 B) and 'union' (A \u222a B) in the context of sets and how they relate to the 'AND' and 'OR' operations. \n*  Remember to avoid double-counting when calculating the total number of people who like both fruits.\n*  Practice analyzing truth tables and applying this knowledge to solve similar problems. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution and why the correct answer is (a) True:\n\n**1. Understanding the Statement:**\n\nThe statement  `\u00ac(P \u2227 Q) \u2194 (\u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ)`  deals with the relationship between conjunction (`\u2227`, AND), disjunction (`\u2228`, OR), and negation (`\u00ac`, NOT). It implies that the negation of a conjunction is logically equivalent to the disjunction of the negations of the individual propositions.\n\n**2. Breaking it Down:**\n\n* **P is True and Q is False** - This is our given scenario.\n* **(P \u2227 Q):**  True AND False evaluates to **False** because in a conjunction, both propositions must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n* **\u00ac(P \u2227 Q):** NOT False evaluates to **True**. Negation flips the truth value.\n* **\u00acP:** NOT True evaluates to **False**.\n* **\u00acQ:** NOT False evaluates to **True**.\n* **(\u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ):** False OR True evaluates to **True**. In a disjunction, if at least one proposition is true, the entire statement is true.\n* **\u00ac(P \u2227 Q) \u2194 (\u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ):** True \u2194 True evaluates to **True**. The biconditional (`\u2194`) operator signifies logical equivalence - the statement is true if both sides have the same truth value.\n\n**3. The Importance of Order of Operations:**\n\nWhile the order of operations (parentheses, negation, conjunction, disjunction, biconditional) is important in general,  it doesn't impact the outcome in this specific case. The truth values of the sub-expressions are determined by their individual components and the order doesn't affect the final result.\n\n**4. Why this is Relevant for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Logical Reasoning:**  IBPS PO and SBI PO exams emphasize logical reasoning skills. Understanding propositional logic is crucial for analyzing arguments, evaluating statements, and identifying patterns in data.\n* **Data Interpretation:**  Banking exams often involve analyzing data presented in tables and charts. Knowing how to interpret truth values and identify logical relationships can help you derive insights and make informed decisions.\n* **Problem-Solving:**  Many questions in these exams require you to break down complex problems into simpler parts and apply logical rules to arrive at solutions. This skill is transferable to various aspects of banking, such as risk assessment, financial analysis, and customer service.\n\n**In summary, understanding propositional logic, including concepts like truth tables and logical equivalence, is vital for success in banking exams. This question demonstrates how to systematically evaluate statements, identify logical connections, and arrive at the correct truth value.** \n",

Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B:** This describes a scenario where the original statement is true, not the negation. \n* **Option C:** This scenario introduces a condition not present in the original statement (high interest rates), making it irrelevant.\n* **Option D:** This scenario contradicts the original statement's condition by stating the stock market is bearish.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThe negation of a conditional statement is true only when the original statement is false. By understanding the truth table and the negation of the original statement, we can accurately identify the scenario where the negation is true. \n",

This means they essentially say the same thing, even if they are phrased differently. \n* **Biconditionals:**  A biconditional statement is formed using \"if and only if\" (often abbreviated as \"iff\").  It states that two conditions are equivalent. For example, \"A number is even iff it is divisible by 2\".\n* **Applying the Concept:**  A biconditional is logically equivalent to two conditional statements and their converses. This is crucial for finding the correct answer.\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n* **Option A:**  This option uses \"or\" as the connector and negates the original conditionals. This is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n* **Option B:** This option changes the order of the conditional statements and their converses. This is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n* **Option C:** This option expresses the original conditional statements using biconditionals.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question is asking about a logic gate that controls access to a high-security lab.  The system works based on two factors:\n\n1. **Biometric Authentication:**  A fingerprint scanner verifies the user's identity. \n2. **Authorization Level:** A database checks if the user has the required clearance.\n\nAccess is granted only if *either* the fingerprint scan is successful *or* the authorization level is high, but *not* if both are successful. This is the key to understanding which logic gate is correct.\n\nThe correct answer is **A) XOR Gate**. Here's why:\n\n* **XOR Gate (Exclusive OR):** The XOR gate outputs a '1' (True) only when its two inputs are different. In this case, access is granted if:\n    * Fingerprint scan is successful (1) and authorization level is low (0)  **OR**\n    * Fingerprint scan is unsuccessful (0) and authorization level is high (1)\n\nThis perfectly matches the access control requirement - access is granted only when one condition is met, but not both.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **B) NAND Gate:** The NAND gate outputs a '0' (False) only when both inputs are '1'. This means it would deny access even if only one condition is met, which is not the desired behavior.\n* **C) XNOR Gate:** The XNOR gate outputs a '1' (True) only when both inputs are the same.  This would grant access when both conditions are met (fingerprint scan successful and authorization level high), which violates the rule of access only if one condition is met.\n* **D) NOR Gate:** The NOR gate outputs a '1' (True) only when both inputs are '0'.  This would never grant access because it requires both the fingerprint scan and authorization level to be unsuccessful, making it entirely unsuitable for the access control system.\n\n**In summary, the XOR gate is the only logic gate that accurately reflects the access control system's functionality, as defined by the question.** \n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understand the Truth Tables:** Knowing the truth tables for basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR) is crucial. \n* **Analyze the Problem:** Break down complex scenarios into smaller, logical steps to identify the correct gate.\n* **Focus on the Output:**  The question asks about the output of the gate, so be clear on the conditions for a '1' or '0' output. \n* **Practice, Practice, Practice:**  Solving many practice questions will help you become familiar with different logic gate applications. \n",

If one component is true and the other is false, the biconditional statement is **false**.\n\n**Analyzing the Scenario**\n\n1. **Conditions for Loan Approval:** \n    * **P:** The borrower has a credit score above 700 and has been employed for at least 2 years.\n    * **Q:** The loan amount is less than $50,000 or the borrower provides a co-signer with a credit score above 750.\n\n2. **Borrower's Situation:** The borrower has a credit score of 720 and has been employed for 3 years, but requests a loan of $60,000 without a co-signer.\n\n3. **Evaluating Truth Values:**\n    * **P:** True (credit score above 700 and employed for 2+ years).\n    * **Q:** False (loan amount is not less than $50,000 and no co-signer).\n\n4. **Biconditional Statement:** The bank will approve the loan **if and only if** both P and Q are true. Since Q is false, the biconditional statement is **false**.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **a) True:** This is incorrect because the biconditional statement is only true when both P and Q have the same truth value. Since Q is false, the statement is false.\n* **c) Cannot be determined:**  We have all the necessary information to determine the truth value of the statement based on the given conditions.\n* **d) Sometimes true, sometimes false:** This is incorrect. The biconditional statement's truth value is fixed based on the truth values of P and Q in this specific scenario. It's not a matter of being sometimes true and sometimes false. \n\n**Key takeaway for IBPS PO, SBI PO exams:**\n\n* Understand the concept of biconditional statements and their truth tables.\n* Practice analyzing scenarios and determining the truth values of component statements.\n* Apply the rules of biconditional statements to reach the correct conclusion.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThese types of questions often appear in logical reasoning sections of banking exams.  They test your ability to think critically and apply logic principles.  Understanding biconditional statements and their truth values is essential for solving these questions effectively. \n",

It's only false when P is true, and Q is false.\n* **Disjunction (\u2228):** \"P \u2228 Q\" means \"P or Q\". It's true if at least one of P or Q is true.\n* **Conjunction (\u2227):** \"P \u2227 Q\" means \"P and Q\". It's true only if both P and Q are true.\n* **Biconditional (\u2194):** \"P \u2194 Q\" means \"P if and only if Q\". It's true when both P and Q have the same truth value.\n\n**Step-by-Step Evaluation:**\n\n1. **(P \u2192 Q):**  Since P is True and Q is False, (P \u2192 Q) is **False** (True implies False is False).\n\n2. **(R \u2228 \u00acS):**  R is False and S is True, so \u00acS is False.

            "question": "The recent surge in social media activism has led to a significant increase in awareness of environmental issues, particularly plastic pollution. Many celebrities and influencers have joined the movement, advocating for the reduction of single-use plastics. This trend has undoubtedly spurred consumer demand for eco-friendly alternatives, leading to a boom in the market for reusable water bottles, bamboo straws, and other sustainable products. However, critics argue that this shift towards sustainability is largely performative, a superficial trend driven by social pressure rather than genuine concern for the environment. They point out that many consumers purchase these products primarily to project a socially conscious image rather than making significant lifestyle changes to reduce their environmental impact. This suggests that the rise in eco-friendly product sales might not be directly indicative of a genuine shift towards sustainable practices, and the impact on plastic pollution might be less substantial than initially perceived.",

Validity:** An argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the premises are:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Social media activism has increased awareness of plastic pollution.\n* **Premise 2:** Celebrities and influencers are advocating for reducing single-use plastics.\n* **Premise 3:** This has led to a surge in demand for eco-friendly products.\n* **Premise 4:** Critics argue that this shift is driven by social pressure rather than genuine concern.\n\nThe **conclusion** is: \n\n* **The rise in eco-friendly product sales might not be indicative of a genuine shift towards sustainable practices and the impact on plastic pollution might be less substantial than initially perceived.**\n\nThe problem lies in the **leap** the argument makes.  It **assumes** that increased sales of eco-friendly products directly translate into reduced plastic pollution.  However, the argument doesn't establish a causal link between the two.  There are other factors at play:\n\n* **Individual behaviour:**  Even if people buy eco-friendly products, they might not consistently use them or make other significant lifestyle changes.\n* **Production and disposal:** The production and disposal of eco-friendly products can also have environmental impacts. \n* **Global consumption patterns:**  Plastic pollution is a complex issue with global implications. Increased sales in one region might not offset rising plastic use elsewhere. \n\nTherefore, the **conclusion doesn't logically follow** from the premises. The argument overreaches in its claims about the direct impact of eco-friendly product sales on plastic pollution. \n\n**2. Soundness:** An argument is sound if it is both valid and all its premises are true. We already established that this argument is not valid.  Furthermore, the argument relies on the assumption that the shift towards eco-friendly products is driven by genuine concern for the environment. This premise is questionable because the argument itself acknowledges the critics' point about performative behavior. This assumption weakens the argument's soundness.\n\n**In conclusion:** The argument is flawed because it oversimplifies the complex relationship between social media activism, consumer behavior, and environmental impact.  It lacks a clear causal connection between eco-friendly product sales and reduced plastic pollution, and it relies on an unproven assumption about consumer motivations. Therefore, the argument is neither valid nor sound.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* Understand the concepts of validity and soundness.\n* Be able to identify logical fallacies in arguments, particularly assumptions and overgeneralizations.\n* Analyze arguments by carefully examining the premises, conclusion, and the relationship between them.\n* Consider potential counter-arguments and alternative explanations.\n\n**Practice Questions:**\n\nYou can practice this skill by applying these concepts to other arguments you encounter in practice materials or news articles.  Look for arguments that jump to conclusions, make sweeping generalizations, or rely on faulty assumptions. \n",

It essentially translates to:\n\n* **If** the car is red (R) and the driver is wearing a hat (H), **then** the car is a sports car (S), **but only if** the car has a sunroof (U). \n* **Otherwise** (if any of the above conditions are not met), the car is not a sports car (\u00acS) and the driver is not wearing a hat (\u00acH).\n\n**Analyzing the Truth Table:**\n\nThe truth table provided lists all possible combinations of truth values for the variables R, H, U, S, and \u00acS. We need to calculate the truth values for the two compound statements:\n\n1. **(R \u2227 H) \u2192 S:** This represents the first part of the statement \u2013 a conditional statement where the antecedent is the conjunction of R and H, and the consequent is S.\n2. **(U \u2227 \u00acS) \u2228 (\u00acR \u2227 \u00acH):** This represents the second part of the statement \u2013 a disjunction (OR) of two conjunctions.\n\n**Evaluating the Compound Statements:**\n\n**Let's look at the missing row (option c):**\n\n* **R = F, H = T, U = T, S = F, \u00acS = T:**\n    * **(R \u2227 H) \u2192 S:**  (F \u2227 T) \u2192 F.

The bank experiences a data breach during the transition period, resulting in a loss of customer trust and potential legal repercussions.**\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of why this is the most critical contingency and how it relates to the IBPS PO/SBI PO exam context:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Cybersecurity Regulations:** The question highlights the pressure on a bank to implement stringent cybersecurity regulations. This is a major concern for financial institutions globally, and especially relevant in India where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has strict guidelines.\n* **Aging Infrastructure:** The bank's existing systems are outdated, making them vulnerable to attacks. This is a common issue in the banking sector, where legacy systems can be challenging to upgrade.\n* **Cyberattacks:** The question notes a recent rise in cyberattacks targeting financial institutions. This underlines the urgency of the situation, as the bank's vulnerability is heightened in the current climate.\n* **Time Pressure:** The deadline for compliance is approaching, adding further stress to the situation.\n\n**Why Option D is the Most Critical:**\n\n* **Direct Impact:** A data breach during this vulnerable period would have immediate and severe consequences. This includes:\n    * **Reputational Damage:** Customers would lose trust in the bank's ability to protect their data, leading to a loss of business and potentially impacting the bank's brand value. \n    * **Financial Losses:** The bank could face significant financial losses due to stolen funds, legal expenses for data breach investigations, and compensation to affected customers.\n    * **Legal Repercussions:** The bank could face legal action from regulators and customers due to data privacy violations, especially under India's data protection laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the upcoming Personal Data Protection Bill.\n* **Urgency:** While the other options are important, a data breach poses the most immediate and critical threat. The bank's primary focus should be on preventing a breach to avoid these immediate consequences.\n* **Customer Trust:**  In the banking sector, customer trust is paramount. A data breach would erode this trust, potentially causing long-term damage to the bank's relationships with its customers.\n\n**Why Other Options are Less Critical:**\n\n* **Option A (Incompatible Infrastructure):** This is a significant challenge, but it can be addressed through planning, budget allocation, and potential phased implementations. The bank has time to overcome this obstacle.\n* **Option B (Shortage of Cybersecurity Professionals):**  This is a common issue in the cybersecurity field, and banks can address it through recruitment, training, and partnering with cybersecurity specialists. While important, it's not as immediate a threat as a data breach.\n* **Option C (Competitor Advantage):** While competitive pressure is a factor, it's not the most critical contingency. The bank's primary focus should be on its own security to avoid catastrophic consequences.\n\n**Exam Relevance:**\n\nThis question aligns with the IBPS PO and SBI PO exam syllabus, focusing on:\n\n* **Cybersecurity Awareness:** Understanding the risks and implications of cyberattacks, especially for financial institutions.\n* **Contingency Planning:** Identifying critical risks and developing strategies to mitigate them.\n* **Problem-Solving Skills:** Analyzing a situation, prioritizing concerns, and identifying the most urgent action. \n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question emphasizes the importance of prioritizing cybersecurity, especially in the context of sensitive financial data. Banks must be prepared to handle data breaches, which can have devastating consequences. This is crucial knowledge for aspiring banking professionals who need to understand the security challenges faced by financial institutions. \n",

Setting up the Truth Table:**\n\nTo analyze the clues efficiently, we create a truth table with rows representing scientists and columns representing their possible fields:\n\n| Scientist | Cryptography | Bioengineering | Nanotechnology | Astrophysics |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Dr. Anya |  |  |  |  |\n| Dr. Ben |  |  |  |  |\n| Dr. Chloe |  |  |  |  |\n| Dr. David |  |  |  |  |\n\n**3. Filling the Truth Table based on Given Information:**\n\n* **Clue 1:** If Dr. Anya works on cryptography, then Dr. Ben works on nanotechnology. \n    * We know Dr. Ben works on nanotechnology, so this clue doesn't directly tell us about Dr. Anya. However, it implies that if Dr. Ben isn't working on nanotechnology, then Dr. Anya can't be working on cryptography.\n* **Clue 2:** If Dr. Chloe works on bioengineering, then Dr. David does not work on astrophysics.\n    * This clue is important because it creates a dependency: if Dr. Chloe is working on bioengineering, Dr. David is forced to work on either cryptography or nanotechnology. \n* **Clue 3:** Dr. Anya and Dr. Chloe are not working on the same field.\n    * This means their rows will have exactly one 'T' each. \n* **Clue 4:** At least one of the scientists works on cryptography or bioengineering.\n    * This is a key constraint, and we'll analyze its implications later.\n* **Clue 5:** Dr. Ben and Dr. David are working on different fields.\n    * This confirms that Dr. David is not working on nanotechnology.\n\n**4. Applying Logic and Eliminating Possibilities:**\n\n* **Focus on Dr. Ben:** Since Dr. Ben works on nanotechnology, his row will have 'T' under nanotechnology and 'F' in all other columns.\n\n* **Analyzing Dr. Anya:**  From Clue 1, we know Dr. Anya cannot work on cryptography if Dr. Ben isn't working on nanotechnology. Since Dr. Ben *is* working on nanotechnology, we cannot definitively say whether Dr. Anya works on cryptography or not. However, we can rule out bioengineering and astrophysics for Dr. Anya.\n\n* **Analyzing Dr. Chloe:** From Clue 2, if Dr. Chloe works on bioengineering, Dr. David must work on either cryptography or nanotechnology. Since Dr. Ben already works on nanotechnology, Dr. David *must* work on cryptography. This implies that Dr. Chloe cannot work on bioengineering (as Dr. Anya cannot work on cryptography).\n\n* **Final Analysis:**  Given that Dr. Ben works on nanotechnology, Dr. David works on cryptography, and Dr. Chloe cannot work on bioengineering, the only remaining possibility is that Dr. Anya works on astrophysics. This satisfies all the given constraints, but it leaves no one to work on bioengineering. This means **none of the scientists can be working on bioengineering.**\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **D) None of the above**. The logic puzzle, combined with the truth table, demonstrates how analyzing conditional statements and constraints can lead to a definitive answer, even when the initial information seems incomplete. \n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Truth Tables:**  Understand the logic behind truth tables and how they can be used to represent conditional statements and analyze logic puzzles.\n* **Deductive Reasoning:**  Practice deducing information from given clues, recognizing implications and contradictions.\n* **Elimination Techniques:**  Master the art of eliminating possibilities to narrow down potential solutions. \n* **Constraint Analysis:**  Pay attention to constraints or limitations imposed by the problem, as they often provide crucial information.\n\nBy practicing similar logic puzzles and understanding the techniques outlined above, you can build the skills necessary to excel in these types of questions during your IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided question tests your understanding of truth tables and logical reasoning, both crucial for analytical and problem-solving skills necessary for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question presents a scenario of bank loan approval, with four propositions:\n\n* **P:** The bank approves the loan.\n* **Q:** The borrower has a good credit score.\n* **R:** The borrower has a stable income.\n* **S:** The loan amount is less than $10,000.\n\nThe bank's loan approval process is defined by three rules, each setting a condition for loan approval based on the truth values of Q, R, and S.\n\n**2. Constructing the Truth Table:**\n\nTo represent the loan approval process, we need to build a truth table that considers all possible combinations of truth values for P, Q, R, and S. The final column \"Approval\" will indicate whether the loan is approved based on the given rules:\n\n| P | Q | R | S | Approval |  Rule Applied |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| T | T | T | T | T | 1 |  // Good credit, stable income, any amount -> Approved\n| T | T | T | F | T | 1 |  // Good credit, stable income, any amount -> Approved\n| T | T | F | T | T | 2 |  // Good credit, unstable income, less than $10,000 -> Approved\n| T | T | F | F | F | 2 |  // Good credit, unstable income, more than $10,000 -> Not Approved\n| F | T | T | T | F | 3 |  // Poor credit, any income, any amount -> Not Approved\n| F | T | T | F | F | 3 |  // Poor credit, any income, any amount -> Not Approved\n| F | T | F | T | F | 3 |  // Poor credit, any income, any amount -> Not Approved\n| F | T | F | F | F | 3 |  // Poor credit, any income, any amount -> Not Approved\n| F | F | T | T | F | 3 |  // Poor credit, any income, any amount -> Not Approved\n| F | F | T | F | F | 3 |  // Poor credit, any income, any amount -> Not Approved\n| F | F | F | T | F | 3 |  // Poor credit, any income, any amount -> Not Approved\n| F | F | F | F | F | 3 |  // Poor credit, any income, any amount -> Not Approved\n\n**3. Evaluating the Proposition:**\n\nWe need to find the truth value of the proposition: **(\u00acQ \u2228 R) \u2227 (S \u2192 P) \u2192 P**  given Q is false (\u00acQ is true), R is true, and S is true.\n\n* **\u00acQ \u2228 R:**  Both \u00acQ and R are true, so their disjunction (\u00acQ \u2228 R) is also **true**.\n* **S \u2192 P:** S is true, and from the truth table, we see that when Q is false and R is true, P is also true. Therefore, S \u2192 P is **true**.\n* **(\u00acQ \u2228 R) \u2227 (S \u2192 P):** Since both \u00acQ \u2228 R and S \u2192 P are true, their conjunction is **true**.\n* **(\u00acQ \u2228 R) \u2227 (S \u2192 P) \u2192 P:**  Both the antecedent ((\u00acQ \u2228 R) \u2227 (S \u2192 P)) and the consequent (P) are true, making the implication **true**.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is A) True.**\n\n**Key Takeaways for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Truth Tables:** Mastering truth tables is essential for understanding logical propositions and their relationships. You should be able to create and interpret truth tables for various logical connectives like conjunction, disjunction, implication, and negation.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** These questions test your ability to apply logical reasoning skills. You need to be able to identify the key elements of a problem, break down complex propositions, and analyze the implications of different truth values.\n* **Contextual Application:** In banking exams, these skills are crucial for analyzing financial data, evaluating risk, and making informed decisions.\n\n**Practice is key:** To excel in these topics, practice with various questions involving truth tables, logical connectives, and scenarios. Analyze the solutions and try to understand the underlying logic. This will help you build confidence and proficiency in tackling similar questions in your exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks you to find the Boolean expression represented by a given truth table.  This is a fundamental concept in Boolean Algebra, which is crucial for understanding digital logic and computer science.\n\n**Understanding the Truth Table:**\n\nThe truth table shows the output of a Boolean expression for all possible combinations of input variables (A, B, C, D, E). Each row represents a unique combination of input values, and the corresponding output is either '0' or '1'.\n\n**Breaking Down the Correct Answer:**\n\nThe correct answer is **(d) (\u00acA \u2228 B \u2228 \u00acC) \u2227 (\u00acD \u2228 E) \u2227 (C \u2228 \u00acE)**.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **\u00acA \u2228 B \u2228 \u00acC**: This part of the expression represents a condition where the output is '1' if *at least one* of these three conditions is true:\n    * \u00acA (not A):  A is '0'\n    * B: B is '1'\n    * \u00acC (not C): C is '0'\n\n* **\u00acD \u2228 E**: This part represents a condition where the output is '1' if *at least one* of these conditions is true:\n    * \u00acD (not D): D is '0'\n    * E: E is '1'\n\n* **C \u2228 \u00acE**: This part represents a condition where the output is '1' if *at least one* of these conditions is true:\n    * C: C is '1'\n    * \u00acE (not E): E is '0'\n\n* **\u2227 (AND)**: The '\u2227' symbol represents the logical 'AND' operator.  This means the entire expression will be '1' only if **all three** of the parts above are true.\n\n**Verifying the Correctness:**\n\n* Let's examine the truth table. We can see that the output is '1' only when all three conditions are met: \n    * **(\u00acA \u2228 B \u2228 \u00acC) is true:**  This is true for all rows where A is '0', or B is '1', or C is '0'.\n    * **(\u00acD \u2228 E) is true:** This is true for all rows where D is '0', or E is '1'.\n    * **(C \u2228 \u00acE) is true:** This is true for all rows where C is '1', or E is '0'.\n\nSince all three conditions must be true for the output to be '1', the expression (d) accurately represents the truth table.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **(a)** (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB \u2227 \u00acC) \u2228 (\u00acD \u2227 \u00acE) \u2228 (C \u2227 E): This expression outputs '1' for cases like (0,0,1,0,0) where the output should be '0' according to the truth table.\n* **(b)** (\u00acA \u2228 \u00acB \u2228 \u00acC) \u2227 (D \u2228 E) \u2227 (A \u2228 B \u2228 C): This expression outputs '0' for cases like (1,0,0,1,0) where the output should be '1' according to the truth table.\n* **(c)** (A \u2227 B \u2227 \u00acC) \u2228 (\u00acD \u2227 E) \u2228 (C \u2227 \u00acE): This expression outputs '1' for cases like (0,1,1,1,0) where the output should be '0' according to the truth table.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is relevant to IBPS PO/SBI PO exams because it tests your understanding of Boolean Algebra, which is a fundamental concept in computer science and therefore relevant to the banking sector. These exams often test your logical reasoning abilities, and understanding truth tables and Boolean expressions is a key part of that.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Understanding the truth table is crucial for determining the Boolean expression.\n* Be familiar with the logical operators: \u2227 (AND), \u2228 (OR), \u00ac (NOT).\n* Practice converting truth tables to Boolean expressions and vice versa. \n* The more you practice, the better you will become at identifying the correct expression and reasoning behind it. \n",
