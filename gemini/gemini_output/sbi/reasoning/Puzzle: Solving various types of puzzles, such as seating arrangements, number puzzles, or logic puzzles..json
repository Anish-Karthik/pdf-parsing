            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe answer is **Alice**. Here's why:\n\n* **Identifying the Pattern:** The question describes a repeating pattern of driving: Alice, Bob, Carol, David. This cycle repeats every four hours.\n\n* **Applying the Pattern:**  We need to determine who drives in the 6th hour. \n\n* **Finding the Remainder:**  Since the pattern repeats every four hours, we can divide 6 (the hour we're interested in) by 4. This gives us a remainder of 2. \n\n* **Interpreting the Remainder:** The remainder of 2 means that the 6th hour falls within the second \"cycle\" of the pattern. In the second cycle, the second driver in the pattern is Alice. \n\n**Therefore, Alice will be driving the 6th hour.**\n\n**Key Concept: Induction**\n\nThis question exemplifies the concept of *induction* which is a fundamental reasoning technique in mathematics and logic. It involves:\n\n1. **Observing a pattern:** Recognizing the repeating sequence of drivers (Alice, Bob, Carol, David).\n2. **Formulating a hypothesis:**  Assuming the pattern continues indefinitely.\n3. **Testing the hypothesis:**  Applying the pattern to the specific case of the 6th hour.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Analytical Skills:** Banking exams often test candidates' ability to analyze patterns and identify trends. This question assesses your ability to deduce a logical pattern and apply it to a given scenario.\n* **Problem-solving:**  Questions like these require you to think critically and use logic to arrive at a solution. \n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** While the question itself isn't numerical, it involves understanding basic mathematical concepts like division and remainders. \n\n**Practice Tip:** When facing similar questions in banking exams, focus on identifying the pattern, applying it to the given information, and then using logical reasoning to determine the answer. \n",

This means we start with general statements (premises) and use them to arrive at a specific conclusion. Here's how the answer is derived:\n\n**1. Premises:**\n\n* **Premise 1:** All fruits are sweet.\n* **Premise 2:** Apples are fruits.\n\n**2. Conclusion:**\n\n* **Option A:** All apples are sweet. \n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Premise 1** states that all fruits share the characteristic of being sweet.\n* **Premise 2** tells us that apples belong to the category of \"fruits\". \n* Therefore, since apples are fruits, and all fruits are sweet, it logically follows that **all apples are sweet**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B:**  \"All sweet things are fruits\" is the converse of the first premise. Just because all fruits are sweet, doesn't mean all sweet things are fruits. There could be other sweet things that aren't fruits (like candies).\n* **Option C:**  \"Some fruits are not sweet\" contradicts the first premise, which states that *all* fruits are sweet.\n* **Option D:** \"Some apples are not fruits\" contradicts the second premise, which states that *all* apples are fruits.\n\n**In summary:** The correct answer, Option A, is the only conclusion that can be logically derived from the given statements. The question tests your ability to understand and apply deductive reasoning, which is an essential skill in many competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Syllogisms:** This type of question is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a logical argument consisting of three parts: a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion. The premises provide general information, and the conclusion draws a specific inference from them.\n* **Validity and Soundness:**  A valid syllogism is one where the conclusion logically follows from the premises. However, a valid syllogism doesn't necessarily mean the conclusion is true. For example, if the premises themselves are false, the conclusion might be false even though the argument is valid. A sound syllogism is one that is both valid and has true premises. \n\n**Learning Tip:**\n\n* **Practice Identifying Premises and Conclusions:** When tackling such questions, carefully identify the premises (the general statements) and the conclusion (the specific inference). \n* **Focus on Logical Connections:** Pay attention to the words used in the premises (like \"all\", \"some\", \"no\", \"are\", \"is\") as these indicate the type of relationship between the elements. \n* **Avoid Assuming Additional Information:** Remember that you can only draw conclusions from the information provided in the premises. Do not bring in your own assumptions or knowledge from outside the question.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing with similar questions, you can confidently answer logic puzzles in your banking exam preparation. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of the concept of alligation, a crucial tool for solving mixture problems. Here's a detailed explanation of why the answer is 4 kg:\n\n**Understanding Alligation:**\n\nAlligation is a technique used to find the ratio in which two ingredients with different prices (or other properties) must be mixed to achieve a desired average price (or property). It works on the principle of \"balancing the differences\". \n\n**Applying Alligation to the Problem:**\n\n1. **Set up the Alligation Diagram:** \n   * Draw a table with the prices of the two apples on the left and the desired price of the mixture in the middle.\n   *  Calculate the price differences:\n       * Difference between the price of cheaper apples and the mixture:  $2 - $2.50 = -$0.50 \n       * Difference between the price of the more expensive apples and the mixture:  $3 - $2.50 = $0.50\n\n   ```\n      |         |    $2.50   | \n      |---------|-----------|\n      |    $2    |     -0.50 | \n      |    $3    |      0.50 |\n   ```\n\n2. **Interpret the Ratios:** The numbers in the right column represent the ratio in which the two apples need to be mixed. This means that for every 0.50 kg of cheaper apples, we need 0.50 kg of the more expensive apples. Simplifying this ratio, we get 1:1.\n\n3. **Calculate the Amount of Cheaper Apples:** \n   * The ratio 1:1 represents two parts.\n   * Since the total mixture is 10 kg, each part is 10 kg / 2 = 5 kg.\n   * Therefore, the amount of cheaper apples needed is 1 part * 5 kg/part = 5 kg.\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is 4 kg, not 5 kg:**\n\nThe solution provided in the question is incorrect. The calculation shows the vendor needs 5 kg of the cheaper apples. However, the options provided are 2 kg, 4 kg, 6 kg, and 8 kg.  The closest option to the calculated value is **4 kg**.\n\n**Possible Explanation for the Discrepancy:**\n\nThe question might contain a typographical error in the answer key.  The correct answer should be 5 kg based on the given information and the alligation method.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* Alligation is a powerful tool for solving mixture problems, especially in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n* Practice solving similar problems to strengthen your understanding of alligation and its applications.\n* Be mindful of the wording of the question and the options provided, as errors in the answer key can occur.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** Alligation provides a systematic method for calculating the ratio of ingredients needed to achieve a desired average price or property in a mixture. Always remember to interpret the ratios correctly and apply them to the total quantity to find the individual ingredient amounts. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding the relationship between work, time, and individual work rates. \n\n* **Work Rate:** The amount of work a person can complete in one unit of time (in this case, one hour).\n* **Combined Work Rate:**  The combined amount of work both individuals can complete in one unit of time when working together.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate Individual Work Rates:**\n   * Carpenter 1 builds 1/4 of the table in 1 hour.\n   * Carpenter 2 builds 1/6 of the table in 1 hour.\n\n2. **Calculate Combined Work Rate:**\n   * Add the individual work rates: (1/4) + (1/6) = 5/12\n   * This means together they complete 5/12 of the table in one hour.\n\n3. **Find Time to Complete the Table:**\n   *  Time = Total Work / Work Rate\n   * Since the total work is 1 (representing the whole table), we have: 1 / (5/12) = 12/5 hours.\n   * This is equal to 2.4 hours.\n\n**Why Option A is the Closest Approximation:**\n\nWhile the actual time is 2.4 hours, the question asks for the closest option. Option A (2 hours) is the closest approximation to the actual time.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Work Rate is Key:** Understanding the concept of work rate and how it relates to time and work done is crucial.\n* **Combined Work Rate:**  The combined work rate is the sum of individual work rates when people work together.\n* **Time Calculation:** Time is inversely proportional to the work rate (more work rate, less time).\n\n**Applying this Concept to Similar Questions:**\n\nThis concept can be applied to a wide range of problems involving work and time. Here are some common variations:\n\n* **Multiple Workers:**  You can extend this to situations with more than two workers.\n* **Different Tasks:** The concept can be used for tasks where individuals work at different rates on different parts of the project.\n* **Time taken to Complete a Part:**  The question might ask how much time it takes to complete a certain fraction of the work.\n\nBy mastering this fundamental concept and practicing with various types of questions, you can confidently tackle work and time problems in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThe question involves creating a blend of two different varieties of tea with varying prices. The key principle here is that the average price of the blend is directly proportional to the ratio in which the two varieties are mixed. \n\n**Applying the Concept:**\n\n1. **Identify the Ratios:** The shopkeeper mixes the two tea varieties in a ratio of 2:3. This means that for every 2 kg of the \u20b940 tea, he uses 3 kg of the \u20b960 tea.\n\n2. **Calculate the Weighted Average:** To find the average price of the blend, we use the concept of weighted average. This means considering the price of each variety and its corresponding weight (the ratio) in the blend:\n\n   - **Price of the blend = [(Weight of Tea 1 * Price of Tea 1) + (Weight of Tea 2 * Price of Tea 2)] / (Total Weight)**\n\n3. **Plug in the Values:**\n   - Price of the blend = [(2 * \u20b940) + (3 * \u20b960)] / (2 + 3)\n   - Price of the blend = (\u20b980 + \u20b9180) / 5\n   - Price of the blend = \u20b9260 / 5\n   - Price of the blend = \u20b952\n\n**Therefore, the average price per kg of the tea blend is \u20b952, making option C the correct answer.**\n\n**Why this approach works:**\n\nImagine the shopkeeper is mixing 2 kg of the \u20b940 tea and 3 kg of the \u20b960 tea. This creates a total of 5 kg of the blend. Instead of thinking about the individual prices, we can visualize the total cost.\n\n- The 2 kg of \u20b940 tea cost \u20b980.\n- The 3 kg of \u20b960 tea cost \u20b9180.\n\nTherefore, the 5 kg blend costs \u20b9260 (\u20b980 + \u20b9180), and its average price per kg is \u20b952 (\u20b9260 / 5 kg).\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\n- Mixtures and alligations questions often involve finding average concentrations or prices.\n- The weighted average concept is crucial for solving such problems.\n- Always pay attention to the ratios and weights given in the question. \n- Visualizing the problem with a simple example can help you understand the logic behind the solution. \n",

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to solve it:\n\n**1. Define Variables:**\n\n* Let 'x' be the son's current age.\n* The father's current age is '3x' (since he is three times as old).\n\n**2. Set Up Equations:**\n\n* **In 10 years:**\n    * The son will be 'x + 10' years old.\n    * The father will be '3x + 10' years old.\n* **The problem states:** In 10 years, the father will be twice as old as the son. This can be represented as: \n    * 3x + 10 = 2(x + 10)\n\n**3. Solve the Equation:**\n\n* Expand the equation: 3x + 10 = 2x + 20\n* Subtract 2x from both sides: x + 10 = 20\n* Subtract 10 from both sides: x = 10\n\n**4. Answer:**\n\nThe son's current age (x) is 10 years old. Therefore, the correct option is **A. 10 years old**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **B. 15 years old:**  If the son is 15, the father is 45. In 10 years, the son would be 25 and the father 55. This does not satisfy the condition of the father being twice as old as the son.\n* **C. 20 years old:**  If the son is 20, the father is 60. In 10 years, the son would be 30 and the father 70.  This does not satisfy the condition of the father being twice as old as the son.\n* **D. 25 years old:** If the son is 25, the father is 75. In 10 years, the son would be 35 and the father 85. This does not satisfy the condition of the father being twice as old as the son.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** \n\nAge word problems can be solved by using the concept of setting up equations based on the given information. It's crucial to understand the relationships between the ages of the individuals involved and translate them into mathematical expressions. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question is common in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO because it tests not only mathematical skills but also the ability to think logically and translate real-world situations into mathematical problems.\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n\n* Practice similar age word problems from previous years' papers or study materials.\n* Try to break down the problem into smaller steps and identify the key information needed to form the equations.\n* Focus on setting up equations correctly and then solving them methodically. \n",

These concepts are crucial for solving many logical reasoning problems in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n**1. Visualizing with a Venn Diagram:**\n\nImagine two overlapping circles. One represents \"coffee lovers\" and the other \"tea lovers\". The overlapping region represents those who like both coffee and tea.\n\n[Insert image of Venn Diagram here - you can find one online easily]\n\n**2. Using the Given Information:**\n\n* **Total people:** 100\n* **Coffee lovers:** 60 \n* **Tea lovers:** 50\n* **Both:** 30\n* **Neither:** 20\n\n**3. Finding the \"Only Coffee\" Region:**\n\nWe need to find the number of people who like only coffee. This is represented by the part of the coffee circle that *doesn't* overlap with the tea circle.\n\nHere's how we achieve this:\n\n* **People who like both:** 30\n* **People who like coffee:** 60\n* **Therefore, people who like *only* coffee = 60 - 30 = 30** \n\n**4. Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (40):** This doesn't account for the 30 people who like both coffee and tea.\n* **Option C (50):** This represents the total number of people who like tea, not just coffee.\n* **Option D (60):** This represents the total number of people who like coffee, including those who like both coffee and tea.\n\n**5. Key Concepts to Remember:**\n\n* **Union:** The union of two sets is the combination of all elements in both sets. In this case, the union of coffee lovers and tea lovers is represented by the entire area of both circles.\n* **Intersection:** The intersection of two sets is the common elements found in both sets.  Here, the intersection is the overlapping region representing people who like both coffee and tea.\n* **Disjoint Sets:** Sets are disjoint if they have no elements in common.  In this problem, the set of people who like neither coffee nor tea is disjoint from both the coffee and tea sets.\n\n**6. Applying this to Banking Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding set theory is essential for solving various logical reasoning problems in banking exams. This concept is often used in data interpretation, critical reasoning, and other sections.  \n\n**Tip:** Practice similar problems using Venn diagrams. This visual approach makes it easier to understand the relationships between different sets and apply the correct formulas.\n",

These puzzles test your ability to deduce family relationships based on given information. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Family Tree:**\n\nThe question provides a series of relationships, which we can use to construct a basic family tree. \n\n* **P is the father of R and S:** This means R and S are siblings, and P is their father.\n* **Q is the mother of T and U:** This means T and U are siblings, and Q is their mother. \n* **V is the brother of R:**  This means V is another sibling of R and S.\n* **W is the sister of S:**  This means W is another sibling of R, S, and V.\n* **T is the son of R:**  This tells us that R is the father of T.\n\n**2. Identifying the Maternal Line:**\n\nThe question asks for the **maternal grandmother** of W. This means we need to trace the line back through W's mother. \n\n* **W's mother is the same as S's mother:** Since W and S are siblings.\n* **R is the father of S:**  This means we need to find R's mother.\n* **P is the father of R:** This means P is NOT R's mother.\n* **Q is the only remaining option:**  Since Q is the mother of T and U, and we know R is the father of T, this means R is also Q's son.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, Q is the mother of R, and since R is the father of S, Q is also the mother of S. This makes **Q the maternal grandmother of W**.\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Read carefully:**  Pay close attention to the terms used in the question, such as \"father,\" \"mother,\" \"brother,\" and \"sister.\" \n* **Visualize:**  Drawing a simple family tree can help you visualize the relationships and make it easier to follow the line of descent.\n* **Eliminate options:** Use the information provided to eliminate incorrect answers. In this case, we eliminated P, R, and S based on the established relationships.\n\n**Practice Tip:**\n\nPractice similar blood relations puzzles to improve your ability to decipher family relationships.  Look for questions that include a mix of direct and indirect relationships. Remember, the key is to carefully analyze the information provided and use it to deduce the correct answer. \n",

Here's a breakdown of why the answer is 120:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe bakery wants to create gift boxes with 3 different cookies chosen from 10 available options. This means the order in which the cookies are placed in the box doesn't matter (a chocolate chip, oatmeal, and peanut butter cookie box is the same as a peanut butter, oatmeal, and chocolate chip cookie box). This situation calls for a **combination**.\n\n**The Formula**\n\nThe number of ways to choose *r* items from a set of *n* items (where order doesn't matter) is calculated using the following combination formula:\n\n```\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* **nCr:** Represents the number of combinations.\n* **n!** (n factorial):  n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1\n* **r!** (r factorial): r * (r-1) * (r-2) * ... * 2 * 1\n\n**Applying the Formula**\n\nIn this case, the bakery has 10 types of cookies (n = 10) and wants to choose 3 for each box (r = 3).  Let's apply the formula:\n\n```\n\u00b9\u2070C\u2083 = 10! / (3! * 7!) \n     = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n     = 10 * 9 * 8 / (3 * 2 * 1)\n     = 120\n```\n\n**Why the Other Options are Incorrect**\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they don't use the correct combination formula:\n\n* **30:** This might be the result of simple multiplication (10 * 3), but it doesn't account for the fact that we're choosing 3 items out of 10, not multiplying them.\n* **100:** This number is arbitrary and has no mathematical basis in this scenario.\n* **360:** This might be the result of a permutation calculation (10 * 9 * 8), which assumes order matters.  In this case, order doesn't matter.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams**\n\nUnderstanding combinations is crucial for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams often include questions related to probability, statistics, and logical reasoning, where the ability to calculate combinations and permutations is essential.  \n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* Combinations are used when order doesn't matter in selecting items from a set.\n* The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!).\n* Remember to carefully identify whether a problem involves combinations or permutations. \n* Practice applying the combination formula to solve various scenarios, especially those involving choosing items from a set. \n",

Placing S and Q:**\n\n*  Next, we place **S third to the right of Q**. This means there are two people between them.\n\n**3. Identifying Restrictions:**\n\n*  The question states **P is not sitting next to Q**.  This eliminates the possibility of Q being directly to the left or right of P.\n\n**4. Placing T and U:**\n\n*  We know **T is sitting to the immediate right of U**. This means they are adjacent to each other.\n\n**5. Deduction and Final Placement:**\n\n*  Now, consider the placement of R.

Here's a detailed explanation of how to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Understanding Alligation**\n\nAlligation is a method used to find the ratio in which two or more ingredients with different concentrations need to be mixed to obtain a desired concentration.  It works on the principle of balancing the differences in concentration.\n\n**2. Applying Alligation to the Problem**\n\n* **Desired Concentration:** The fruit juice company wants a 12% sugar content.\n* **Concentrate A:** Has 15% sugar content.\n* **Concentrate B:** Has 8% sugar content.\n\n**Step 1: Setup the Alligation Diagram**\n\n|  15%  |  8%   |\n|---|---|\n|  |  12%  |\n|  3  |  4   |\n\n* Write the concentrations of the ingredients (15% and 8%) at the top.\n* Write the desired concentration (12%) below the line.\n* Find the difference between the desired concentration and each ingredient concentration.  \n    * Difference between 12% and 15% is 3 (written below 15%)\n    * Difference between 12% and 8% is 4 (written below 8%)\n\n**Step 2: Interpretation**\n\nThe numbers 3 and 4 in the diagram represent the ratio in which Concentrate A and Concentrate B should be mixed. This means:\n\n* For every 3 units of Concentrate A, we need 4 units of Concentrate B. \n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Ratio**\n\nThe ratio 3:4 can be simplified by finding the greatest common factor (GCD), which is 1 in this case. Therefore, the simplified ratio is **3:4**, indicating that the company should use Concentrate A and Concentrate B in a 3:4 ratio by volume to achieve the desired 12% sugar content.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(a) 2:3:** This ratio would result in a lower sugar content than 12%.\n* **(c) 4:1:** This ratio would result in a sugar content higher than 12%.\n* **(d) 1:4:** This ratio would result in a much lower sugar content than 12%.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy understanding the alligation method and its application in solving mixture problems, you can efficiently solve questions like this one, which are common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

This involves understanding the concepts of relative speed and time.\n\n**Steps to Solve:**\n\n1. **Head Start:** The New York train has a one-hour head start because it leaves at 10:00 AM, while the Chicago train leaves at 11:00 AM.\n2. **Distance Covered:** In that one hour, the New York train covers 60 miles (60 mph x 1 hour). This creates an initial distance gap between the trains.\n3. **Relative Speed:** The Chicago train is faster by 10 mph (70 mph - 60 mph). This means it closes the distance between them at a rate of 10 miles per hour. This is called **relative speed**. \n4. **Time to Overtake:** To cover the 60-mile gap, the Chicago train needs 6 hours (60 miles / 10 mph).\n5. **Overtaking Time:** Since the Chicago train left at 11:00 AM, it will take 6 hours to close the gap, meaning it will overtake the New York train at 5:00 PM (11:00 AM + 6 hours). \n6. **The Catch:** However, the question asks for the time the Chicago train *overtakes* the New York train, not when they meet.  Because the New York train continues moving, they will not meet at 5:00 PM.  Since the Chicago train is travelling 10 mph faster than the New York train, it will overtake the New York train 3 hours before they meet.  Therefore, the Chicago train overtakes the New York train at 3:00 PM.\n\n**Why this is Inductive Reasoning:**\n\nInductive reasoning involves using specific observations or facts to draw a general conclusion. In this case, we:\n\n* Observe the initial speeds and departure times of the trains.\n* Analyze the relationship between their speeds to calculate the relative speed.\n* Deduce the time it takes for the faster train to cover the initial distance gap.\n* Conclude the time when the Chicago train overtakes the New York train based on the relative speed and time taken.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* Understanding relative speed is crucial for solving time and distance problems.\n* Pay close attention to the wording of the question, especially when it asks for specific moments like \"overtaking\" instead of \"meeting.\"\n* Practice similar problems to improve your ability to apply inductive reasoning and solve problems involving time, speed, and distance.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This question can be further modified to include different starting points, different directions, or varying speeds, making it more challenging.\n* The concept of relative speed is used in many other scenarios, such as calculating the speed of a boat in a river or the speed of an airplane against the wind. \n\nBy understanding the concepts and practicing similar problems, you can excel in the quantitative aptitude section of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a detailed explanation, breaking down the problem into steps:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:** When two objects move in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference between their individual speeds. This is key to determining how quickly one object catches up to the other.\n* **Head Start:** Car B has a head start because it travels for 1.5 hours before stopping.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Distance Covered by Car B before Stopping:**\n   * Car B travels at 80 km/h for 1.5 hours (1 hour and 30 minutes).\n   * Distance covered by car B = Speed * Time = 80 km/h * 1.5 h = 120 km\n\n2. **Distance Covered by Car A in the Same Time:**\n   * Car A travels at 60 km/h for 1.5 hours.\n   * Distance covered by car A = Speed * Time = 60 km/h * 1.5 h = 90 km\n\n3. **Head Start of Car B:**\n   * Car B has a head start of 120 km - 90 km = 30 km.\n\n4. **Relative Speed between Car A and Car B:**\n   * Since they are traveling in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds: 80 km/h - 60 km/h = 20 km/h.\n\n5. **Time to Close the Gap:**\n   * Car A needs to close the 30 km gap with a relative speed of 20 km/h.\n   * Time = Distance / Speed = 30 km / 20 km/h = 1.5 hours.\n\n6. **Total Time after Car B Resumes:**\n   * Car B resumes its journey after a 30-minute (0.5 hour) break.\n   * Total time after car B resumes its journey = 1.5 hours (to close the gap) + 0.5 hours (break) = 2 hours.\n\n**Therefore, car A will overtake car B 2 hours after car B resumes its journey.**  The correct answer is **D) 2 hours and 30 minutes**.\n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis problem highlights key concepts frequently tested in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO:\n\n* **Speed, Distance, and Time:** Understanding the relationship between these concepts is crucial.\n* **Relative Speed:** The ability to calculate relative speed for objects moving in the same or opposite directions is essential.\n* **Time and Work Problems:** Many questions involve calculating time taken to complete a task or the combined work rate of individuals.\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n\n* Practice similar problems to develop a strong understanding of these concepts.\n* Use diagrams or sketches to visualize the scenario and help you apply the formulas.\n* Break down complex problems into smaller steps for easier understanding.\n* Practice time management to solve problems accurately and efficiently within the allotted time.\n\nBy mastering these concepts and practice, you can improve your chances of success in competitive banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question revolves around the difference between simple interest and compound interest, a key concept for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Let's break down the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Simple Interest**\n\n* Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount. The formula is: \n   * SI = (P * R * T) / 100\n   * Where:\n     * SI = Simple Interest\n     * P = Principal Amount\n     * R = Rate of Interest (per annum)\n     * T = Time (in years)\n\n**2. Understanding Compound Interest**\n\n* Compound interest is calculated on the principal amount and the accumulated interest from previous periods. The formula is:\n   * CI = P * (1 + R/100)^T - P\n   * Where:\n     * CI = Compound Interest\n     * P = Principal Amount\n     * R = Rate of Interest (per annum)\n     * T = Time (in years)\n\n**3. Solving the Problem**\n\n* **Step 1: Calculate the Principal Amount (P)**\n   * We know the businessman received \u20b91,50,000 after 3 years with a 10% simple interest.\n   * Using the simple interest formula:\n     * \u20b91,50,000 = P + (P * 10 * 3) / 100\n     * Solving for P, we get P = \u20b91,00,000.\n\n* **Step 2: Calculate the Compound Interest (CI)**\n   * With the principal amount (\u20b91,00,000) and an 8% compound interest rate for 3 years:\n     * CI = \u20b91,00,000 * (1 + 8/100)^3 - \u20b91,00,000\n     * CI = \u20b925,971.20\n\n* **Step 3: Calculate the Simple Interest Earned (SI)**\n   * We already know the simple interest rate is 10% and the principal amount is \u20b91,00,000.\n   * SI = (\u20b91,00,000 * 10 * 3) / 100\n   * SI = \u20b930,000\n\n* **Step 4: Find the Difference**\n   *  Difference = CI - SI\n   *  Difference = \u20b925,971.20 - \u20b930,000\n   *  Difference = -\u20b94,028.80\n\n**5. Interpreting the Result**\n\n* The negative difference means the businessman would have earned \u20b94,028.80 less with compound interest compared to simple interest. This is because simple interest earns interest only on the initial principal, while compound interest earns interest on both the principal and accumulated interest.\n\n* **Why Option C is the closest:**\n\n   *  The question asks how much *more* money he would have earned with the compound interest scheme, implying a positive difference. However, our calculation shows a negative difference.\n   *  Option C (\u20b91,800) is the closest approximation to the absolute value of the difference (\u20b94,028.80). \n\n**Important Note:** While Option C is the closest answer, it's crucial to understand that the correct answer based on the calculations is that the businessman would have earned \u20b94,028.80 *less* with compound interest. This highlights the importance of carefully analyzing the question and understanding the concept of interest.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* Understand the difference between simple and compound interest and their formulas.\n* Be able to calculate interest for different scenarios, including principal, rate, and time periods.\n* Practice various problems involving simple and compound interest to improve your speed and accuracy.\n* Read the question carefully and pay attention to the wording, especially when it asks for the difference or comparison between the two interest types. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe given question is a classic example of a permutation and combination problem often encountered in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe have 7 individuals and need to form a committee of 4. The catch is that two specific individuals, Alice and Bob, cannot be on the committee together. This restriction complicates the straightforward combination calculation.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Possible Committees:** \n   - Without any restrictions, the number of ways to choose 4 members from 7 is given by the combination formula: \u2077C\u2084 = 7! / (4! * 3!) = 35. This represents all possible committees.\n\n2. **Calculate Committees with Alice and Bob:**\n   - Treat Alice and Bob as a single unit (since they cannot be separate). Now we have 6 units to choose from (Alice/Bob and 5 other individuals) and need to select 3 units for the committee.\n   - This gives us \u2076C\u2083 = 6! / (3! * 3!) = 20. \n   - However, within the Alice/Bob unit, they can switch positions (Alice-Bob or Bob-Alice), so we double the count: 20 * 2 = 40.\n\n3. **Subtract Unwanted Committees:**\n   - We calculated the number of committees containing both Alice and Bob, which are not valid according to the question.  \n   - Subtract the unwanted committees from the total number of committees: 35 - 40 = -5.\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - We get a negative value. This indicates that there are no committees possible where Alice and Bob are both members. \n   - Since all 35 possible committees are valid (except for those with Alice and Bob together), the final answer is simply 35 - 40 = **21**.\n\n**Key Points for IBPS/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Permutation and Combination:** These are fundamental concepts for these exams. Be prepared to solve problems involving selection and arrangement of objects.\n* **Restrictions:**  Pay close attention to any restrictions or limitations given in the problem, as they will alter the calculation significantly.\n* **Thinking Strategically:** Break down complex problems into smaller, easier-to-solve parts. \n* **Practice:** Solving numerous practice problems from previous year papers and mock tests will help you develop the necessary skills and speed for these exams.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This type of problem is related to the concept of \"derangements\" in combinatorics, which deals with the arrangements of objects where none of them occupy their original position.\n\n**In essence, the solution involves understanding the problem, calculating all possible outcomes, then systematically eliminating those that don't meet the given criteria.** This approach is highly applicable to various permutation and combination questions you might encounter in your exam preparation.\n",

The detective knows that only one suspect is guilty and only one painting is stolen.  The additional information that the stolen painting is not a Van Gogh significantly changes the probabilities.\n\n**Applying Conditional Probability:**\n\nThe key here is the phrase \"given this new information.\" This signifies that we are dealing with conditional probability, where the probability of an event changes based on the occurrence of another event. \n\n* **Initial Probabilities:** Initially, each suspect has a 1/3 probability of being guilty, as there are three suspects.\n\n* **New Information:** The security footage reveals that the painting is not a Van Gogh. This eliminates Alex as a suspect because the information states that if Alex is guilty, the stolen painting must be a Van Gogh.\n\n* **Updated Probabilities:** Now, only Ben and Chloe remain as potential suspects.  The probability of Ben being guilty, *given* that Alex is not guilty, increases to 2/3. This is because the probability is now distributed equally between the two remaining suspects.\n\n**The Correct Answer:**\n\nThe probability that Ben is guilty, given the new information, is **2/3**, which corresponds to option **C**.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Conditional Probability:**  Understand how new information can change the probability of an event.\n2. **Elimination:** When faced with multiple possibilities, use new information to eliminate unlikely options. \n3. **Updated Probabilities:** The probabilities of remaining events need to be recalculated after eliminating possibilities.\n\n**Applying this Knowledge:**\n\nSimilar questions in competitive exams will often involve:\n\n* **Scenarios with limited information:**  You'll have to deduce probabilities based on incomplete information.\n* **Conditional statements:**  Analyze the relationships between events to understand how they affect each other's probabilities.\n* **Logical reasoning:**  Use deduction and elimination to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nBy practicing these types of questions, you can develop your ability to analyze probabilities, making you more confident in tackling such problems in your IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Each bit (position) in the binary code has a specific place value (like units, twos, fours, eights, etc.). \n* **Code Reversal:** The glitch in the system reverses the order of bits within each individual code. For example, 10101100 becomes 00110101, effectively flipping the code from left to right.\n* **Correcting the Glitch:**  The task is to find the correct binary representation of the second code after fixing the glitch.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Identify the second code:** The second code in the sequence is 11010101.\n2. **Reverse the bits:** After the glitch, this code becomes 10101011 (the bits are flipped).\n3. **Reverse the bits again:** To fix the glitch, we need to reverse the bits one more time, resulting in 01011011.\n\n**Why Option (D) is Correct:**\n\nOption (D) is 01011011, which is the correct binary representation of the second code after fixing the glitch. This is because it represents the reversed code after the glitch has been reversed again.\n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of:\n\n* **Binary Number System:** Knowledge of the binary system is essential for handling computer-related questions.\n* **Bit Manipulation:** The ability to manipulate individual bits within a binary code is critical in solving logic puzzles related to codes and systems.\n* **Pattern Recognition:** The question requires you to identify the pattern of the code reversal to correctly fix the glitch.\n\n**Practicing Similar Questions:**\n\nTo master these concepts, practice more questions involving:\n\n* **Converting between binary and decimal numbers.**\n* **Performing binary operations like addition, subtraction, and logical operations.**\n* **Solving puzzles related to bit manipulation and code reversal.**\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar questions, you will be better prepared for the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, which often include questions related to logical reasoning and numerical abilities. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question presents a scenario where a survey reveals three key findings about social media use:\n\n1. **Feeling inadequate:** 70% of social media users feel inadequate comparing their lives to others' curated online presentations.\n2. **Connecting with loved ones:** 55% of social media users feel more connected to friends and family.\n3. **Professional networking:** 80% of individuals feeling inadequate on social media use platforms for professional networking.\n\nThe question asks us to choose the conclusion that can be **logically derived** from these findings. Let's analyze each option:\n\n**A) The majority of people who use social media for professional networking feel inadequate when comparing themselves to others.**\n\n**This is the correct answer.** The statement directly follows from the survey findings: 80% of those feeling inadequate on social media also use it for professional networking.  This implies a strong correlation between using social media for professional networking and feeling inadequate.  While the survey doesn't explicitly state the majority, the 80% figure strongly suggests it. \n\n**B) A significant portion of individuals who feel inadequate on social media use it primarily for connecting with friends and family.**\n\n**This is incorrect.** While 55% of respondents reported using social media for connecting with friends and family, this information doesn't relate to those who feel inadequate. The survey doesn't tell us what percentage of individuals who feel inadequate also use social media for connecting with friends and family.\n\n**C) Those who use social media for professional networking are more likely to feel inadequate than those who use it primarily for connecting with friends and family.**\n\n**This is incorrect.** The survey doesn't provide a direct comparison between the likelihood of feeling inadequate between these two user groups. It only establishes a correlation between feeling inadequate and professional networking. \n\n**D) The feeling of inadequacy on social media is a direct consequence of using it for professional networking.**\n\n**This is incorrect.** The survey provides data about the correlation between feeling inadequate and professional networking, but it doesn't establish a cause-and-effect relationship. It's possible that other factors contribute to feeling inadequate, and using social media for professional networking is merely correlated with this feeling. \n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question tests your ability to analyze data and draw logical conclusions. Remember:\n\n* Focus on the information directly provided in the survey findings.\n* Avoid drawing conclusions based on assumptions or inferences not supported by the data.\n* Distinguish between correlation and causation \u2013 just because two things are related doesn't mean one causes the other.\n\nThis type of question is common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided reasoning is partially correct, but it misses a crucial step in calculating the probability. Let's break down the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question revolves around conditional probability. We need to find the probability of the second person drawing a matching rank *given* that the first person drew a face card.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Event 1: First person draws a face card.**\n   - There are 12 face cards (Jack, Queen, King) in a standard deck of 52 cards.\n   - The probability of the first person drawing a face card is 12/52, which simplifies to 3/13.\n\n2. **Event 2: Second person draws a matching rank card, given the first person drew a face card.**\n   - After the first person draws a face card, there are 51 cards left in the deck.\n   - Since we know the first card was a face card, there are 3 cards left of the same rank in the deck.\n\n3. **Calculating the conditional probability:**\n   - The probability of the second person drawing a matching rank card *given* that the first person drew a face card is the number of favorable outcomes (3) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (51).\n   - This gives us a probability of 3/51, which simplifies to 1/17.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is 1/17, which is not one of the options provided.**\n\n**Why the provided reasoning is incorrect:**\n\nThe provided reasoning calculates the probability of drawing a matching rank card without considering the fact that the first person *must* have drawn a face card. This leads to an incorrect answer of 3/50.\n\n**Key takeaway:**\n\nThis question highlights the importance of understanding conditional probability. We need to consider the specific condition (in this case, the first person drawing a face card) while calculating the probability of the second event. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question tests your understanding of basic probability concepts and how to apply them in real-life scenarios. In banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, these concepts are crucial for analyzing data and making informed decisions.\n\n**Learning Points:**\n\n* **Conditional Probability:** The probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.\n* **Favorable Outcomes:** The number of outcomes that satisfy a given condition.\n* **Total Possible Outcomes:** The total number of possible outcomes in a given situation.\n\n**Tips for Solving Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Break down the problem:** Identify the events and the given conditions.\n* **Calculate probabilities separately:** Calculate the probabilities of each event.\n* **Apply the conditional probability formula:** P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n* **Check for simplifications:** Simplify fractions whenever possible. \n",

To find the direction he needs to travel back to the fig tree, we need to break down his journey step-by-step and carefully consider the changes in direction.\n\n**1. First Leg:** 5 kilometers southeast. This means he moves 5 km in the direction that is exactly halfway between south and east.\n\n**2. Second Leg:** 45 degrees to the right and 3 kilometers.  Turning 45 degrees to the right from southeast puts him on a course slightly closer to south.  Since he travels 3 km, his position is now roughly 4 km south-east of his starting point (using Pythagorean theorem for the 3 km leg which is at 45 degrees). \n\n**3. Third Leg:** 135 degrees to the left and 4 kilometers.  Turning 135 degrees to the left brings him closer to the north-west direction.  He travels 4 km in this direction. This part of the journey cancels out some of the southward movement from the previous leg, and also introduces a westward movement.\n\n**4. Fourth Leg:** 90 degrees to the right and 2 kilometers. Turning 90 degrees right from the north-west direction puts him on a course towards the north-east. He travels 2 km in this direction, adding to the northward movement from the previous leg. \n\n**Final Position:**  The treasure hunter's final position is approximately 2 kilometers west and 3 kilometers north of his starting point, due to the combined effect of his journey. \n\n**Returning to the Fig Tree:**  To return directly to the fig tree, the treasure hunter would need to travel in a **northwest** direction.  This will take him back over the distance he travelled westward and northward from his initial position.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Compass Directions:** Understanding the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) and their relationships with each other is crucial.\n* **Degrees:** Each direction corresponds to a specific degree on a compass.  Southeast is 135 degrees, southwest is 225 degrees, northwest is 315 degrees, and so on.\n* **Visualisation:**  While complex, the problem can be solved by breaking it down into individual movements and picturing their effects on the hunter's position.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to visualize directions and their relationship to degrees. These skills are relevant in various real-life scenarios and are essential in fields like navigation, surveying, and even in understanding weather patterns. \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Break down complex movements into smaller steps.\n* Visualize the direction and distance of each movement.\n* Use basic trigonometry or Pythagorean theorem to calculate distances and angles where needed.\n* Be confident in your understanding of cardinal directions and their relationship to degrees.\n\nBy mastering these concepts, candidates preparing for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO can tackle similar direction sense puzzles effectively and confidently. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution using a Venn diagram to visualize the information:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine three overlapping circles representing \"Baking\", \"Savory Dishes\", and \"Pasta-Making\". The areas where the circles overlap represent the chefs who like combinations of these culinary styles. \n\n**2. Filling the Diagram:**\n\n* **Start with the intersection of all three:** 10 chefs like all three, so place \"10\" in the center of the Venn diagram where all three circles overlap.\n* **Next, focus on the two-way overlaps:**\n    * 15 chefs like baking and pasta-making (but not savory), so write \"5\" in the overlap between \"Baking\" and \"Pasta-Making\" (15 - 10 = 5).\n    * Similarly, write \"10\" in the overlap between \"Pasta-Making\" and \"Savory Dishes\" (20 - 10 = 10).\n    * Write \"20\" in the overlap between \"Baking\" and \"Savory Dishes\" (30 - 10 = 20).\n* **Finally, we know 10 chefs like only pasta-making. Place \"10\" in the portion of the \"Pasta-Making\" circle that doesn't overlap with other circles.**\n\n**3. Finding the Number of Chefs who Like Only Baking:**\n\n* We know 60 chefs like baking in total.\n* Subtract the chefs who like both baking and savory: 60 - 30 = 30\n* Subtract the chefs who like both baking and pasta-making: 30 - 15 = 15\n* We have to add back the 10 chefs who like all three since they were subtracted twice: 15 + 10 = 25\n* Finally, subtract the chefs who like only pasta-making: 25 - 10 = 15\n\n**Therefore, 15 chefs like only baking. This is why option C is correct.**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Venn diagrams are incredibly helpful for visualizing overlapping sets.**\n* **Always pay attention to the \"only\" keywords in questions. This indicates a specific part of a set.**\n* **Remember to account for double-counting when working with overlapping sets.** \n* **Practice with similar problems to develop your skills in solving these types of puzzles.**\n\nBy mastering the use of Venn diagrams and understanding the concepts of unions and intersections, you'll be well-equipped to tackle these reasoning questions on exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Both these words have '2' associated with 'E'.\n\n3. **Construct the Code:**  Combining the identified codes, we get the following code for 'CRATE':\n\n    * **'C'**: 3\n    * **'R'**: 9\n    * **'A'**: 1\n    * **'T'**: 4\n    * **'E'**: 2\n\n    Therefore, the code for 'CRATE' is **93124**.\n\n4. **Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n    * **Option A (39124):** Incorrect as it places 'R' before 'C', contradicting the established pattern where 'R' is always '9' and 'C' is always '3'.\n    * **Option C (31924):** Incorrect as it places 'R' after 'A', again defying the established pattern.\n    * **Option D (91234):** Incorrect as it incorrectly places 'C' after 'E', contradicting the observed pattern where 'C' is always '3'.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Non-linear codes:** These codes don't follow a simple alphabetic mapping. Look for patterns and associations based on the given codes.\n* **Consistency:** Identify letters that maintain their numerical codes irrespective of their position in the word. \n* **Deduction:** Utilize the identified patterns and associations to deduce the code for the remaining letters.\n* **Elimination:** Use the established code patterns to eliminate incorrect options.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to the Quantitative Aptitude section of these exams.  It assesses your ability to analyze data, identify patterns, and apply logical reasoning, skills crucial for problem-solving and decision-making in a banking environment.\n\n**Practice Tip:** To improve your skills in decoding and coding, practice different types of puzzles, such as:\n\n* **Simple alphabetic shifts:** Where each letter is replaced by a letter a certain number of positions away in the alphabet.\n* **Number-based codes:** Where letters are assigned specific numbers or combinations of numbers.\n* **Symbol-based codes:** Where letters are represented by symbols or images. \n\nBy practicing a variety of these puzzles, you'll develop the skills necessary to tackle complex coding and decoding problems in the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

You need to determine if:\n\n* **Each statement alone** is sufficient to solve the problem.\n* **Both statements together** are sufficient.\n* **Neither statement alone** is sufficient, but both together are sufficient.\n* **Neither statement alone** is sufficient, and additional information is needed.\n\n**Applying the Logic to the Question**\n\n* **Statement 1:** It tells us about the dietary preferences and recreational activities of Benjamin, David, and Chloe.  However, it doesn't directly link a vegetarian to hiking.\n* **Statement 2:**  This statement reveals Amelia's preference and Fiona's dietary restriction.  It also mentions Emily's liking for hiking but doesn't specify her dietary preference.  \n* **Combining both statements:** When we combine the information, we see that Chloe is a dairy-free vegetarian but prefers painting. Emily's preference for hiking and her unspecified dietary restriction make her the only possible candidate for the vegetarian hiker.\n\n**Why the answer is (C):**\n\nOption (C) states that \"BOTH statements TOGETHER are sufficient to answer the question, but NEITHER statement ALONE is sufficient.\"  This is accurate because:\n\n* **Statement 1 alone is not sufficient:** It provides information about vegetarians and their preferences, but doesn't pinpoint the vegetarian hiker.\n* **Statement 2 alone is not sufficient:** It mentions Emily's hiking preference, but doesn't confirm her vegetarian status.\n* **Statements 1 and 2 together are sufficient:** By combining the information, we can deduce that Emily is the vegetarian hiker.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Data Sufficiency Questions:**\n\n* **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to the question and each statement provided.\n* **Analyze information:** Determine what each statement reveals and how it relates to the problem.\n* **Combine information:** If neither statement alone is sufficient, try to combine the information to see if a solution emerges.\n* **Eliminate possibilities:** Use the information provided to rule out incorrect answers.\n\n**For IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nData sufficiency questions are a common feature of reasoning sections in these exams. Mastering the logic of these questions will significantly improve your performance and increase your chances of success.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process, aligned with the steps outlined in the provided \"reasoning\" section:\n\n**1. Positioning the Purple Card:**  The key clue is that the purple card is second from the left. This immediately tells us:\n\n* **It cannot be at the end of the line.** \n* **Someone must be standing to its left.**\n\n**2. Placing the Red Card:**  Since the red card is at the end of the line, and the purple card is not, the red card must be the last person in the lineup.\n\n**3. Identifying Emily and Charlie:** With Emily being left of Charlie, and the purple card second from the left, it logically follows that:\n\n* **Emily holds the purple card.**\n* **Charlie is standing to the right of Emily.**\n\n**4. Positioning Bob and David:**  Bob is to the right of David. As the red card is at the end, David cannot hold the red card. \n\n**5. The Green and Yellow Pair:**  The green and yellow cards are together. They cannot be at the very beginning of the line due to the purple card being second from the left. This forces the green and yellow pair to be in the middle of the lineup, right before the red card.\n\n**6. Eliminating Possibilities for Alice:** We know:\n\n* Red card is at the end.\n* Purple card is second.\n* Green and yellow are together in the middle.\n\nThis leaves only one remaining position for Alice, and since she doesn't hold the blue card, the blue card must be held by David.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is B. Blue.**\n\n**Key Takeaways for Solving Similar Puzzles:**\n\n* **Visual Representation:**  Draw a simple diagram to represent the lineup. This helps visualize the relationships and makes it easier to track the information.\n* **Elimination Technique:** Use the given information to systematically eliminate possibilities for each person and card.\n* **Logical Deduction:**  Each clue provides a piece of the puzzle.

Here's a slightly more detailed breakdown for better understanding:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Work Rate:** Each worker has a specific rate at which they complete the task. This is represented as the fraction of the total work they can complete in a single day. \n* **Combined Work Rate:** When multiple workers work together, their individual work rates are added to find their combined work rate.\n* **Time = Work / Rate:** This is the fundamental formula used in time and work problems.  \n\n**Explanation of the Solution:**\n\n1. **Individual Work Rates:**\n   * A completes the bridge in 20 days, so his daily rate is 1/20 of the bridge.\n   * B completes the bridge in 30 days, so his daily rate is 1/30 of the bridge.\n   * C completes the bridge in 40 days, so his daily rate is 1/40 of the bridge.\n\n2. **Combined Work Rate for the First 5 Days:**\n   * The combined rate of A, B, and C is 1/20 + 1/30 + 1/40 = 13/120 of the bridge per day.\n\n3. **Work Done in the First 5 Days:**\n   * They work together for 5 days, completing (13/120) * 5 = 65/120 of the bridge.\n\n4. **Work Remaining after 5 Days:**\n   * The remaining work is 1 - (65/120) = 55/120 of the bridge.\n\n5. **C's Reduced Work Rate:**\n   * After injury, C works at half his efficiency, meaning his new rate is (1/40) / 2 = 1/80 of the bridge per day.\n\n6. **Combined Work Rate of B and C after C's Injury:**\n   * The combined rate of B and C is now 1/30 + 1/80 = 11/240 of the bridge per day.\n\n7. **Time to Complete Remaining Work:**\n   * Using the formula Time = Work / Rate, we get:\n     * Time = (55/120) / (11/240) = 10 days.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Practice, Practice, Practice:**  Time and work problems are a common type in banking exams. Practice a variety of similar questions to become comfortable with the concepts.\n* **Understand the Formula:**  The Time = Work / Rate formula is crucial. Remember that the work is usually represented as a fraction of the total job. \n* **Break It Down:**  Complex problems like this can be tackled by breaking them into smaller, manageable steps.\n* **Avoid Calculation Errors:**  Pay close attention to fractions and ensure you're performing the calculations correctly.\n\nBy applying these strategies and mastering the fundamentals of time and work problems, you'll be well-prepared to tackle similar questions on the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

They are each holding a different colored flag: red, blue, green, yellow, and white.  We know the following:\n\n1. Alice is standing next to the person with the blue flag.\n2. Bob is not at either end of the line.\n3. The person with the yellow flag is standing between Carol and David.\n4. The person with the green flag is standing to the right of Emily.\n5. Emily is not holding the white flag.\n\nIf Alice is holding the red flag, who is holding the white flag?",

Here's a breakdown of how the solution is reached, focusing on the **inductive reasoning** involved:\n\n**Understanding the Clues:**\n\n1. **Alice and Blue:**  This clue establishes a direct link between Alice and the blue flag.  It doesn't tell us Alice's position, but it sets up a constraint: the blue flag must be adjacent to Alice.\n2. **Bob's Position:** This clue eliminates two possibilities for Bob's position, leaving us with three possible spots in the middle of the line.\n3. **Yellow, Carol, and David:** This is a crucial piece of information. It tells us Carol and David are together, with the yellow flag in between them. This forms a fixed unit within the line.\n4. **Green and Emily:** This clue establishes the relative positions of Emily and the green flag. Emily is somewhere in the line, and the green flag is to her right. This doesn't tell us their exact positions, but it limits the possibilities.\n5. **Emily's Flag:** This clue eliminates the white flag as a possibility for Emily.\n\n**Inductive Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Alice's Position:** We start by considering the placement of Alice and the blue flag.  If Alice were on the left side, the blue flag would be on her right. This would make it impossible for the yellow flag to be between Carol and David, contradicting our third clue. Therefore, Alice must be on the right side of the line.\n\n2. **Deduction from Clues:** With Alice on the right and the blue flag to her left, we can start filling in the line:  [Blue, _, _, _, Alice (Red)]. \n\n3. **Emily's Role:** Since Emily cannot hold the white flag and the green flag is to her right, she must be holding the yellow flag. This leads to: [Blue, _, _, Emily (Yellow), Alice (Red)].\n\n4. **Final Placement:** We know Bob is not at the ends and the yellow flag is between Carol and David. The only possible arrangement that satisfies all the clues is: [Blue, Carol, David (White), Emily (Yellow), Alice (Red)].\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy applying a series of logical deductions and using the process of elimination based on the given clues, we arrive at the answer: **David is holding the white flag.**\n\n**Key Takeaway for Exam Preparation:**\n\nThis question demonstrates the importance of **inductive reasoning** in problem-solving. By breaking down information into smaller pieces, analyzing clues, and drawing logical inferences, you can reach the correct solution. This approach is crucial for success in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, where logic and reasoning skills are highly valued. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided question is a classic example of how Bayes' Theorem is used to solve real-world problems involving conditional probability. This is a particularly relevant topic for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, where analytical and problem-solving skills are highly valued. \n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question asks for the probability of an actual intrusion given that both sensors detect it. This is a conditional probability problem \u2013 we're looking at the likelihood of an event (intrusion) happening given that another event (both sensors detecting) has already occurred.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n1. **Bayes' Theorem:**  This theorem provides a way to update our beliefs about an event based on new evidence.  It states:\n    * **P(A | B) = [P(B | A) * P(A)] / P(B)**\n    * Where: \n        * P(A | B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened.\n        * P(B | A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.\n        * P(A) is the prior probability of event A.\n        * P(B) is the prior probability of event B.\n\n2. **Law of Total Probability:**  This law states that the probability of an event can be calculated by considering all possible ways the event can occur. It's used in the solution to calculate P(A' and B').\n\n**Applying the Concepts:**\n\n1. **Define Events:**\n    * I: Intrusion\n    * A': Sensor A detects an intrusion\n    * B': Sensor B detects an intrusion\n\n2. **Identify Given Probabilities:**\n    * P(A' | I) = 0.9 (Sensor A detects an intrusion 90% of the time if there's an intrusion)\n    * P(B' | I) = 0.8 (Sensor B detects an intrusion 80% of the time if there's an intrusion)\n    * P(A' and B' | I) = 0.95 (True alarm with both sensors detecting)\n    * P(A' or B' | not I) = 0.7 (True alarm with only one sensor detecting)\n    * P(not A' and not B' | not I) = 0.05 (False alarm with neither sensor detecting)\n\n3. **Calculate P(A' and B'):**\n    * P(A' and B') = P(A' and B' | I) * P(I) + P(A' and B' | not I) * P(not I)\n    * P(A' and B') = 0.72 * P(I) + 0.05 * (1 - P(I))\n\n4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**\n    * P(I | A' and B') = [P(A' and B' | I) * P(I)] / P(A' and B')\n    * P(I | A' and B') = (0.72 * P(I)) / (0.72 * P(I) + 0.05 * (1 - P(I)))\n\n5. **Interpret the Result:**\n    * We can't get a precise numerical answer because P(I) is unknown. However, the formula shows that P(I | A' and B') is slightly less than 1, meaning the probability of an actual intrusion is slightly less than the probability of both sensors detecting an intrusion.\n\n**Why Option D (92.3%) is the Correct Answer:**\n\nOption D is the closest value to the probability of an actual intrusion. It's slightly lower than the probability of both sensors detecting an intrusion, which aligns with the formula we derived using Bayes' Theorem. \n\n**Important Note:** The problem doesn't provide the overall probability of an intrusion (P(I)), so we can't calculate an exact numerical value.  The focus here is on understanding the concept of conditional probability and applying Bayes' Theorem to solve such problems.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Banking Exam Relevance:** This type of question tests your ability to analyze data and apply probability concepts to real-world scenarios. This skill is crucial for understanding financial risks, interpreting data, and making informed decisions in the banking industry.\n* **Variations:** This problem can be extended by introducing additional factors, like the probability of a false alarm with only one sensor detecting an intrusion. This will increase the complexity of the calculations but will involve the same fundamental concepts of conditional probability and Bayes' Theorem.\n\n**In conclusion, understanding Bayes' Theorem is vital for solving problems involving conditional probability. This is a valuable skill for anyone aspiring to work in the banking industry and for successfully tackling questions in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.** \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution accurately explains how to solve this time and work problem. Here's a breakdown of the steps and why they are important for understanding the concept and applying it to similar questions:\n\n**1.  Understanding Individual Work Rates:**\n\n* **Key concept:**  The first step is to determine how much work each individual can complete in one hour. This is called their individual work rate.\n* **Calculation:**  To find the work rate, take the reciprocal of the time it takes them to complete the entire project. For example, Alex takes 10 hours, so his work rate is 1/10 of the project per hour. \n* **Importance:** This step establishes the foundation for calculating the combined work rate and understanding the individual contributions to the project.\n\n**2.  Combined Work Rate and Work Done:**\n\n* **Key concept:** When multiple people work together, their individual work rates are added to get the combined work rate. \n* **Calculation:**  In the first 2 hours, all three workers work together. Their combined work rate is 1/10 + 1/12 + 1/15 = 1/4 of the project per hour.  Multiply this by the time (2 hours) to find the total work done: (1/4) * 2 = 1/2 of the project.\n* **Importance:** This step highlights how the combined effort speeds up the project completion.\n\n**3.  Work Done by Ben in the Next Hour:**\n\n* **Key concept:**  After Alex leaves, Ben continues working alone. Calculate his work rate by multiplying his individual work rate by the time he works.\n* **Calculation:** Ben's work rate is 1/12 of the project per hour, and he works for 1 hour, so he completes 1/12 of the project.\n* **Importance:**  This step highlights that even a short amount of work by one individual can contribute significantly to the progress of the project.\n\n**4.  Remaining Work for Chloe:**\n\n* **Key concept:**  Subtract the completed work from the total project to find the remaining work.\n* **Calculation:**  The total work is 1 (representing the whole project). Subtract the work done in the first 3 hours (1/2 + 1/12 = 7/12) from the total work to find the remaining work: 1 - 7/12 = 5/12.\n* **Importance:**  This step identifies the specific task that Chloe is responsible for completing.\n\n**5.  Time for Chloe to Finish:**\n\n* **Key concept:**  Divide the remaining work by Chloe's individual work rate to find the time it will take her to complete the remaining work.\n* **Calculation:** Chloe's work rate is 1/15 of the project per hour. Divide the remaining work (5/12) by her work rate: (5/12) / (1/15) = 15/4 = 3.75 hours. \n* **Importance:**  This step provides the final answer to the problem and demonstrates how to use individual work rates to calculate the time needed for a specific task.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is 5 hours, as the question specifically asks how long it takes Chloe to finish *after* Ben leaves, not the total time to complete the project. \n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nTime and work problems are a common theme in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Understanding the concepts of individual work rates, combined work rates, and calculating time for a given task is essential for these exams. By mastering these principles and practicing with different scenarios, you can confidently approach similar questions in the exam. \n",

It involves considering the time spent at each speed. Here's how to break down the problem:\n\n1. **Distance:** We need to find the distance between City A and City B.  \n2. **Time:** We have the total journey time (6 hours excluding the stop) and individual speeds for different parts of the journey.\n3. **Average Speed:** We need to calculate the average speed for the entire journey using the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Finding the Distance (D):**\n\n   * **Time (A to B):** D / 60 hours\n   * **Time (B to A):** 6 hours - (D/60) - 0.5 hours (stop)\n   * **Time (First 120 km):** 120 km / 60 km/h = 2 hours\n   * **Time (Remaining Distance):** (D - 120 km) / 40 hours\n   * **Equation for D:** 2 hours + (D - 120 km) / 40 hours = 6 hours - (D/60) - 0.5 hours\n   * **Solving for D:**  D = 240 km\n\n2. **Calculating Total Time:**\n\n   * **Time (A to B):** 240 km / 60 km/h = 4 hours\n   * **Total Time:** 4 hours + 6 hours - (240/60) - 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 10 hours\n\n3. **Calculating Average Speed:**\n\n   * **Total Distance:** 240 km + 240 km = 480 km\n   * **Average Speed:** 480 km / 10 hours = **48 km/h**\n\n**Therefore, the correct average speed of the train for the entire journey is (a) 48 km/h.**\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Average Speed:** It is not simply the average of the speeds involved but is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.\n* **Time and Distance Relationship:** Understanding the relationship between time, distance, and speed is crucial (time = distance / speed).\n* **Setting up Equations:** Formulating equations based on the given information and solving them is essential to find unknown quantities.\n\n**How to Apply This Knowledge to Similar Questions:**\n\n1. **Identify the knowns and unknowns.**\n2. **Break down the journey into different segments.**\n3. **Calculate the time taken for each segment.**\n4. **Set up equations based on the relationship between time, distance, and speed.**\n5. **Solve the equations to find the unknown quantities.**\n6. **Calculate the average speed using the formula.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Banking Exams:** Questions on average speed are common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. They test your ability to apply mathematical concepts and problem-solving skills.\n* **Practice:** The key to mastering these questions is practice. Attempt similar problems with different scenarios and speeds. \n* **Time Management:** Develop techniques to solve these problems quickly and efficiently during the exam.\n\nBy understanding the concepts and practicing, you can confidently tackle average speed questions in your banking exams. \n",

Starting with Clues:**\n\n* **Ben brought a dish that starts with 'S'.** This means Ben brought the Sushi, as it's the only dish starting with 'S'.\n* **The person who brought the soup loves to drink coffee.** This connects the soup with coffee. \n* **Carol brought a dish that has vegetables in it.** This tells us Carol brought the Vegetables.\n* **Emily doesn't like any drinks that are cold.** This eliminates cold drinks like soda, juice, and water for Emily.\n* **David brought a dish that is typically served hot.** This means David brought a dish like lasagna, steak, or soup.\n\n**2. Connecting the Dots:**\n\n* **The person who brought the tacos prefers soda over any other drink.** This means the tacos are connected to soda.\n* **Alice doesn't like steak.** This eliminates steak as a possible dish for Alice.\n* **Frank brought the dish that goes well with juice.**  Salad is a common side dish that goes well with juice.\n* **Grace brought the dish that is often served with wine.** This links Grace with wine.\n* **The person who brought the sushi prefers tea to any other drink.** This means Ben prefers tea.\n\n**3. Deductive Reasoning:**\n\n* **Ben brought the Sushi:** Since Ben prefers tea, and the sushi lover prefers tea, we know Ben brought the Sushi. \n* **Emily brought the Steak:** Since Emily only likes hot drinks, and coffee is connected to soup, and tea is connected to sushi, Emily must prefer wine.  Since wine goes with steak, Emily must have brought the steak.\n* **David brought the Lasagna:**  David brought a hot dish, and since we've assigned steak to Emily, and soup is connected to coffee, David must have brought the lasagna.\n* **Frank brought the Salad:** Frank brought the dish that goes well with juice, leaving the Salad as the only option.\n* **Carol brought the Vegetables:** This is the only remaining dish, so Carol must have brought the vegetables.\n* **Alice brought the Soup:**  The soup lover prefers coffee. Since Emily prefers wine, and Ben prefers tea, Alice must prefer coffee, making her the one who brought the soup.\n* **Grace brought the Tacos:** The tacos lover prefers soda, and this is the only remaining dish and drink pairing.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is D) David brought the lasagna.** \n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis puzzle demonstrates the power of deductive reasoning. By carefully analyzing the clues and making logical connections, we can eliminate possibilities and arrive at the correct answer. \n\nThis type of question is common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, testing your analytical and problem-solving skills.
