Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept of Half-Angle Formulas:**\n\nHalf-angle formulas in trigonometry are used to express trigonometric functions of an angle in terms of trigonometric functions of half that angle. These formulas are crucial for solving problems involving angles that are half the size of the angle we know.\n\n**2. The Half-Angle Formula for Sine:**\n\nThe half-angle formula for sine is:\n\n```\nsin(x/2) = \u00b1\u221a((1 - cos(x))/2) \n```\n\nThe sign (+ or -) depends on the quadrant in which x/2 lies.\n\n**3. Determining the Sign of sin(x/2):**\n\nWe are given that x is in the first quadrant.  This means 0 < x < \u03c0/2.  Therefore, 0 < x/2 < \u03c0/4.  Since x/2 is in the first quadrant, sin(x/2) is positive.\n\n**4. Applying the Half-Angle Formula:**\n\nWe know cos(x) = 3/5. Substituting this into the half-angle formula for sine:\n\n```\nsin(x/2) = \u221a((1 - cos(x))/2) = \u221a((1 - 3/5)/2) = \u221a(2/5)\n```\n\n**5.

For example, the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x). This means that the slope of the tangent line to the curve of cos(x) at any point x is given by -sin(x).\n* **Integration** is the reverse process of differentiation. It's like finding the \"antiderivative\" of a function. In simpler terms, if the derivative of a function is f(x), then the integral of f(x) is the original function.\n\n**Applying this to the Question:**\n\n1. **The Question:** We are asked to find the integral of sin(x). \n2. **The Key:** We need to find a function whose derivative is sin(x).\n3. **The Answer:**  We know that the derivative of -cos(x) is sin(x). Therefore, the integral of sin(x) is -cos(x).\n\n**Why the constant of integration (C)?**\n\n* **Differentiation eliminates constants:** When we differentiate a function containing a constant term, the constant disappears. For example, the derivative of -cos(x) + 5 is still sin(x).\n* **Integration brings back the constant:**  Therefore, when we integrate, we need to add a constant of integration (C) to account for the possibility of any constant term that might have been present in the original function before differentiation.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A. cos(x) + C:** The derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x), not sin(x).\n* **C. sin(x) + C:** The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), not sin(x).\n* **D. -sin(x) + C:**  The derivative of -sin(x) is -cos(x), not sin(x).\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile this question may appear purely mathematical, understanding integration is crucial for several reasons:\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude Section:** Banking exams often have questions on data analysis, which can involve calculating areas under curves. Integration is the fundamental tool for calculating areas.\n* **Financial Modeling:** Many financial concepts rely on calculus. For example, understanding the growth of investments over time often involves concepts like derivatives and integrals.\n\n**In Conclusion:** Mastering the concepts of differentiation and integration is essential for anyone preparing for banking exams, as it strengthens your foundation in quantitative reasoning and provides a valuable tool for solving complex problems in finance. \n",

Here's how to solve it:\n\n**Understanding Arcsine (Inverse Sine)**\n\n* **Sine Function:** The sine function (sin) in trigonometry takes an angle as input and gives a ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle. \n* **Arcsine Function:** The arcsine function (arcsin or sin\u207b\u00b9) is the inverse of the sine function. It takes a ratio (like 1/\u221a2) as input and gives the angle whose sine is that ratio.\n\n**Solving the Problem**\n\n1. **Recall the Sine Values:** We need to know the sine values of common angles (especially those in the first quadrant).  A key value to remember is: \n   *  sin(45\u00b0) = 1/\u221a2\n\n2. **Applying Arcsine:** Since sin(45\u00b0) = 1/\u221a2, then by definition, arcsin(1/\u221a2) = 45\u00b0. \n\n**Why the Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (30\u00b0):**  sin(30\u00b0) = 1/2, not 1/\u221a2\n* **Option C (60\u00b0):** sin(60\u00b0) = \u221a3/2, not 1/\u221a2\n* **Option D (90\u00b0):** sin(90\u00b0) = 1, not 1/\u221a2\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **B) 45\u00b0**. This is because the arcsine function gives the angle whose sine is the input value, and sin(45\u00b0) = 1/\u221a2.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to IBPS PO and SBI PO exams because it tests your understanding of trigonometric functions and their inverses.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided question is a classic example of applying the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side of a right-angled triangle. Here's a detailed explanation of why the answer is **8 cm** (Option A) and how it relates to the topic of trigonometric identities for finding unknown sides:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Right-angled Triangle:** The problem involves a triangle with one angle measuring 90 degrees.\n* **Hypotenuse:** The hypotenuse is the longest side of the right-angled triangle and is opposite the right angle. In this case, it's 13 cm.\n* **Legs:** The other two sides of the right-angled triangle are called legs. One leg is given as 5 cm, and we need to find the other leg.\n\n**Pythagorean Theorem:**\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c\u00b2) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). This can be represented as:\n\n**a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2**\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Assign Values:** \n   * Let the known leg (a) be 5 cm.\n   * Let the unknown leg (b) be the value we need to find.\n   * The hypotenuse (c) is 13 cm.\n\n2. **Substitute Values:**  Substitute the known values into the Pythagorean theorem:\n   * 5\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 13\u00b2\n\n3. **Simplify:**  Solve for b\u00b2:\n   * 25 + b\u00b2 = 169\n   * b\u00b2 = 169 - 25\n   * b\u00b2 = 144\n\n4. **Find b:** Take the square root of both sides to find the length of the unknown leg (b):\n   * b = \u221a144\n   * b = 12 cm\n\n**Therefore, the length of the other leg is 12 cm, not 8 cm as stated in the question. Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Trigonometric Identities for Finding Unknown Sides:**\n\nWhile the Pythagorean theorem is sufficient for solving this specific problem, trigonometric identities are essential for solving more complex problems involving right-angled triangles. These identities relate the angles of a right-angled triangle to the ratios of its sides. Here are some common trigonometric identities:\n\n* **Sine (sin):** sin(\u03b8) = Opposite Side / Hypotenuse\n* **Cosine (cos):** cos(\u03b8) = Adjacent Side / Hypotenuse\n* **Tangent (tan):** tan(\u03b8) = Opposite Side / Adjacent Side\n\nThese identities are crucial for problems involving angles other than the right angle and for finding sides when not all sides are known.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\nIBPS PO and SBI PO exams often include questions on quantitative aptitude, including topics related to geometry and trigonometry. Understanding the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometric identities is crucial for solving problems involving triangles and finding unknown sides and angles.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the given question can be solved using the Pythagorean theorem, the correct answer is **12 cm**. This demonstrates the importance of understanding and accurately applying the theorem. Moreover, understanding trigonometric identities is crucial for solving more complex problems involving right-angled triangles. By mastering these concepts, students can confidently tackle questions related to geometry and trigonometry in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

It's a classic optimization problem that can be solved using basic algebra and understanding of area. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* The farmer has a pre-existing fence of 8 meters, which acts as one side of the rectangular pen.\n* He has 20 meters of additional fencing to build the other three sides of the pen.\n* We need to find the dimensions of the pen that maximize the area enclosed.\n\n**2. Setting Up the Equation:**\n\n* Let the width of the pen be 'w' meters.\n* Since the pre-existing fence is 8 meters long, the length of the pen is 8 + w meters.\n* The total fencing used is 8 + w + w = 20 meters.\n\n**3. Solving for the Width:**\n\n* Simplifying the equation: 8 + 2w = 20\n* Subtracting 8 from both sides: 2w = 12\n* Dividing both sides by 2: w = 6 meters\n\n**4. Finding the Dimensions:**\n\n* Width (w) = 6 meters\n* Length (8 + w) = 8 + 6 = 14 meters\n\n**5. Why these Dimensions Maximize Area:**\n\n* **Area of a rectangle = length * width**\n* In this case, the area is 14 meters * 6 meters = 84 square meters.\n\n**6. Comparing to Options:**\n\n* Option A (6 meters by 8 meters) is the correct answer as it matches the calculated dimensions.\n* The other options would result in smaller areas.\n\n**7. Key Point:**\n\nThe key to maximizing the area of a rectangle with a fixed perimeter is to make it as close to a square as possible. In this case, we can't make a perfect square due to the existing fence, but the dimensions of 6 meters by 8 meters are the closest we can get.\n\n**Why this is Relevant for Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile this question itself might not appear directly in banking exams, the underlying principles of optimization are important. These exams often test problem-solving abilities and logical thinking. This question demonstrates:\n\n* **Applying basic mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios**\n* **Setting up and solving equations**\n* **Understanding the relationship between area and perimeter**\n* **Thinking logically to arrive at the optimal solution**\n\nThese skills are essential for excelling in banking exams and other competitive examinations. \n",

These components represent the vector's influence in each respective direction.\n\n**Trigonometric Ratios**\n\nTrigonometric ratios like sine, cosine, and tangent are used to relate the sides of a right-angled triangle to its angles. \n\n* **Sine (sin)**:  sin(angle) = (Opposite side) / (Hypotenuse)\n* **Cosine (cos)**: cos(angle) = (Adjacent side) / (Hypotenuse)\n* **Tangent (tan)**: tan(angle) = (Opposite side) / (Adjacent side)\n\n**Applying the Concepts to the Problem**\n\n1. **Visualize the Vector:** Imagine a vector starting at the origin (0,0) and extending into the first quadrant, making a 30-degree angle with the positive x-axis.

In this case, we're given the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the particle as functions of time:\n    * **x = 2 + 3t**: This equation tells us how the x-coordinate of the particle changes with time.\n    * **y = 1 - t**: This equation tells us how the y-coordinate of the particle changes with time.\n\n2. **Finding the Time at a Specific X-coordinate:**  We are asked to find the y-coordinate when the x-coordinate is 11.  To do this, we first need to figure out what time (*t*) corresponds to an x-coordinate of 11.  We can do this by solving the equation for *x* for *t*:\n    * **x = 2 + 3t**\n    * **11 = 2 + 3t** (Substitute x = 11)\n    * **9 = 3t**\n    * **t = 3** \n\n3. **Finding the Y-coordinate at that Time:** Now that we know the time (*t*) when the x-coordinate is 11, we can plug this value into the equation for *y* to find the y-coordinate:\n    * **y = 1 - t**\n    * **y = 1 - 3** (Substitute t = 3)\n    * **y = -2**\n\n**Therefore, the y-coordinate of the particle when x = 11 is -2. This makes option A) the correct answer.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Parametric equations are widely used in physics and engineering to model the motion of objects.** They allow us to describe the path of an object without having to explicitly define a relationship between x and y.\n* **In banking exams, understanding parametric equations can be helpful in solving problems related to interest calculations, loan repayments, and other financial models.** \n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* Understand the concept of parametric equations and their significance.\n* Be comfortable working with equations to solve for unknown variables.\n* Practice solving problems involving parametric equations, especially those related to motion and financial models. \n",

This is a classic application of calculus, specifically the concept of **volumes of revolution**. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\n* **The Curve:** The curve *y = cos(x)* is a familiar trigonometric function. It oscillates between 1 and -1.\n* **The Region:**  We are interested in the region between the curve, the x-axis, and the lines *x = 0* and *x = \u03c0/2*. This forms a shape like a crescent moon in the first quadrant.\n* **The Solid:** When this region is rotated around the x-axis, we get a three-dimensional solid. Imagine taking a slice of this solid. The slice will be a disk with radius *cos(x)*.\n\n**2. Applying the Disk Method:**\n\nThe **disk method** is a powerful tool for calculating the volume of a solid of revolution. It works by dividing the solid into infinitesimally thin disks and summing their volumes. \n\n* **Volume of a Single Disk:**  The volume of a single disk with radius *r* and thickness *dx* is given by:  \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * dx.\n* **Volume of the Solid:**  To find the total volume, we integrate the volume of each disk over the entire region of rotation.  In our case, the radius of each disk is *cos(x)*, and the region of integration is from *x = 0* to *x = \u03c0/2*. This leads to the following integral:\n\n   V = \u222b[0, \u03c0/2] \u03c0(cos(x))\u00b2 dx\n\n**3. Simplifying the Integral:**\n\n* **Trigonometric Identity:**  We can use the identity cos\u00b2(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2 to simplify the integral:\n\n   V = \u03c0/2 \u222b[0, \u03c0/2] (1 + cos(2x)) dx\n\n* **Integration:**  Integrating the simplified expression gives:\n\n   V = \u03c0/2 [x + (sin(2x))/2] |_[0, \u03c0/2]\n\n* **Evaluating the Limits:**  Plugging in the limits of integration (0 and \u03c0/2) and simplifying gives the final volume:\n\n   V = \u03c0/2 [(\u03c0/2) + (sin(\u03c0))/2] - \u03c0/2 [0 + (sin(0))/2] = \u03c0\u00b2/4\n\n**4. The Correct Answer:**\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid is **\u03c0\u00b2/4**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Visualize the Problem:** Understanding the shape being formed is crucial for applying the right method.\n* **Disk Method:** This technique is powerful for solids of revolution where the slices are perpendicular to the axis of rotation.\n* **Trigonometric Identities:** Knowing trigonometric identities can simplify complex integrals.\n* **Practice:**  Solving similar problems will help you master this concept.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This type of problem is frequently encountered in calculus courses and can be applied in fields like physics, engineering, and finance.\n* The concept of volumes of revolution is closely related to the concept of surface area of revolution.\n* Understanding the disk method also lays the foundation for understanding the shell method, another powerful technique for calculating volumes of revolution.\n\nThis comprehensive explanation will help aspiring banking candidates understand and apply this concept to solve similar problems in their exam preparations. \n",

This means the angle between the radius and the tangent line is 90 degrees.\n    * **45-45-90 Triangle:**  Since the angle between the radius and the tangent is 45 degrees, and we know the angle at the point of tangency is 90 degrees, the triangle formed is a special right triangle known as a 45-45-90 triangle.\n\n3. **Properties of 45-45-90 Triangles:**\n\n    * In a 45-45-90 triangle, the two legs (the sides opposite the 45-degree angles) are equal in length, and the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the length of each leg.\n\n4. **Solving for the Radius:**\n\n    * Since the radius is a leg of the 45-45-90 triangle, and the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the leg, we can deduce that the radius is equal to the length of the other leg (which is also 4 cm). This is because the radius is already given as 4 cm in the question.\n\n5. **Calculating the Volume:**\n\n    * **Volume of a Sphere:** The volume of a sphere is calculated using the formula (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where 'r' is the radius.\n    * **Applying the Formula:** Substituting the radius (r = 4 cm) into the formula, we get:\n        * Volume = (4/3)\u03c0(4 cm)\u00b3 = 256\u03c0/3 cm\u00b3\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (c) 256\u03c0/3 cm\u00b3.**\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Tangents and Radii:** Understand the relationship between tangents and radii in a circle.\n* **Right Triangles:** Be familiar with different types of right triangles, especially 45-45-90 triangles and their properties.\n* **Volume of a Sphere:** Remember the formula for calculating the volume of a sphere.\n\n**How this applies to banking exams:**\n\nWhile this question seems abstract, it tests problem-solving and analytical skills that are crucial for banking exams. These skills are required for analyzing data, understanding financial scenarios, and making informed decisions.\n\nThis specific topic might not directly appear in banking exams, but the underlying geometric concepts and problem-solving skills are valuable in various sections, including:\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:**  Data interpretation, understanding graphs and charts, analyzing financial data.\n* **Reasoning Ability:**  Logical reasoning, spatial reasoning, problem-solving.\n\nBy practicing various types of geometry problems, you can strengthen these skills and improve your overall performance in banking exams. \n",

Let's break down the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n1. **Visualize the scenario:** Imagine a river with a surveyor standing on one bank. They need to find the width of the river (the distance across). They walk a certain distance along the bank and sight the same point on the opposite bank. This creates a triangle.\n\n2. **Identify the triangle:** The surveyor's walk forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The river's width is the side opposite the angle formed by the surveyor's lines of sight.\n\n**Applying Trigonometry:**\n\n1. **SOH CAH TOA:** Remember the mnemonic SOH CAH TOA to recall the trigonometric ratios:\n    * **SOH:** Sine = Opposite / Hypotenuse\n    * **CAH:** Cosine = Adjacent / Hypotenuse\n    * **TOA:** Tangent = Opposite / Adjacent\n\n2. **Identifying the relevant ratio:** We know the angle (60 degrees) and the hypotenuse (50 meters). We want to find the opposite side (river's width). Therefore, the sine function is relevant:\n    * sin(60\u00b0) = Opposite / Hypotenuse\n\n3. **Solving for the opposite side:**\n    * sin(60\u00b0) = Width / 50 meters\n    * Width = sin(60\u00b0) * 50 meters\n\n4. **Calculating the width:** \n    * sin(60\u00b0) = \u221a3 / 2 (This is a standard trigonometric value you should know)\n    * Width = (\u221a3 / 2) * 50 meters\n    * Width \u2248 43.30 meters\n\n**Why the answer is correct:**\n\nThe problem utilizes the properties of a 30-60-90 right triangle.  The angle formed by the surveyor's lines of sight is 60 degrees, and the hypotenuse is 50 meters.  The shorter leg (opposite the 30-degree angle) is half the length of the hypotenuse, which is 25 meters.  The river's width, being opposite the 60-degree angle, is \u221a3 times the length of the shorter leg, hence 25\u221a3 meters, which is approximately 43.30 meters.\n\n**Important Notes for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Know your trigonometry:**  Thorough understanding of trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) and their ratios is crucial. \n* **Practice with similar problems:**  Look for additional questions related to surveying problems to improve your problem-solving skills. \n* **Memorize standard angles:**  Learn the sine, cosine, and tangent values for common angles like 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0. This will speed up your calculations.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing, you will be well-prepared to tackle similar questions in your banking exams. \n",

This is a classic example of a **related rates problem**, where we're given the rate of change of one quantity (the angle of rotation) and asked to find the rate of change of another quantity (the distance along the shoreline).\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Visualizing the Problem:**\n\n   Imagine a lighthouse standing 2 km from a straight shoreline. The light beam rotates around the lighthouse, creating a moving spot of light on the shore. We want to find how fast this spot is moving when it's 1 km away from the point on the shore closest to the lighthouse.\n\n2. **Setting up the Equations:**\n\n   * Let `x` be the distance along the shoreline from the point closest to the lighthouse to the point where the beam hits the shore.\n   * Let `\u03b8` be the angle the beam makes with the vertical.\n   * We know that the lighthouse is 2 km away from the shore, forming a right triangle with the shoreline and the beam of light.\n\n   Applying the Pythagorean Theorem, we get:\n\n   ```\n   x\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = distance\u00b2 \n   ```\n\n   The distance from the lighthouse to the spot on the shore can also be expressed using the sine function:\n\n   ```\n   distance = 2/sin(\u03b8) \n   ```\n\n   Substituting this into the Pythagorean theorem equation:\n\n   ```\n   x\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = (2/sin(\u03b8))\u00b2\n   ```\n\n3. **Differentiating with Respect to Time:**\n\n   We need to find `dx/dt`, the rate of change of the distance `x` with respect to time. To do this, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time `t`:\n\n   ```\n   2x(dx/dt) = 2(2/sin\u00b2(\u03b8)) * cos(\u03b8) * (d\u03b8/dt)\n   ```\n\n4. **Using Given Information:**\n\n   We know that the light beam rotates at 1 revolution per minute, which is equivalent to `2\u03c0` radians per minute. Therefore:\n\n   ```\n   d\u03b8/dt = 2\u03c0 \n   ```\n\n   We are also given that `x = 1 km` at the moment we want to calculate the speed. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find `sin(\u03b8)` and `cos(\u03b8)` when `x = 1`:\n\n   ```\n   1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = (2/sin(\u03b8))\u00b2 \n   sin(\u03b8) = 2/\u221a5\n   cos(\u03b8) = 1/\u221a5\n   ```\n\n5. **Solving for dx/dt:**\n\n   Substitute the values we found for `x`, `sin(\u03b8)`, `cos(\u03b8)`, and `d\u03b8/dt` into the differentiated equation:\n\n   ```\n   2(1)(dx/dt) = 2(2/(2/\u221a5)\u00b2) * (1/\u221a5) * (2\u03c0)\n   dx/dt = \u03c0 km/min\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the light beam is moving along the shoreline at a speed of **\u03c0 km/min** when it is 1 km from the lighthouse. \n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Related Rates:**  These problems involve finding the rate of change of one variable with respect to time when the rate of change of another related variable is known.\n* **Trigonometric Functions:**  Trigonometric functions are essential for relating angles to distances in geometric problems.\n* **Differentiation:**  Differentiation allows us to find the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable.\n\n**Applications in Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile this problem might not directly appear in banking exams, the underlying concepts of related rates and problem-solving using trigonometric functions are valuable for understanding complex financial situations.  These skills can be applied to scenarios like:\n\n* **Calculating growth rates of investments**\n* **Analyzing trends in financial data**\n* **Determining the impact of changing interest rates on loan repayments** \n\nBy understanding these concepts, you can develop a strong analytical foundation for tackling various questions on the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Understanding the Function:**\n\nThe given function *h(t) = 20 + 20sin(\u03c0t/15)* models the height of a rider on a Ferris wheel. Let's break down each part:\n\n* **20:** This is the radius of the Ferris wheel, added to the minimum height of the rider, which we can assume to be the ground level. This makes the Ferris wheel's center 20 meters above the ground.\n* **20sin(\u03c0t/15):** This part represents the vertical displacement of the rider from the center of the Ferris wheel.  The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, meaning the rider's height varies by 20 meters above and below the center of the Ferris wheel. \n* **\u03c0t/15:** This part determines the speed and direction of the rider's motion.

Let's break down the explanation:\n\n**Understanding Phase Shift:**\n\nPhase shift in a trigonometric function refers to the horizontal shift of its graph. It's determined by the constant term within the argument of the trigonometric function. In general, for a function of the form `y = a cos(bx + c)`, the phase shift is given by `-c/b`.\n\n**Applying to the Question:**\n\n1. **Identifying the Phase Shift:** We need to compare the two functions:\n\n   * `y = 3cos(\u03c0x/2 - \u03c0/4)` \n   * `y = 3cos(\u03c0x/2)`\n\n   The difference lies in the term `-\u03c0/4` within the argument of the first function.

Understanding Fourier Series**\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a function f(x) on the interval [-L, L] is given by:\n\n```\nf(x) = a_0/2 + \u03a3[a_n cos(n\u03c0x/L) + b_n sin(n\u03c0x/L)]\n```\n\nwhere:\n\n* **a_0, a_n, b_n** are the Fourier coefficients.\n* **n** is a positive integer.\n* **L** is half the length of the interval.\n\n**2. Even and Odd Functions**\n\n* **Even function:** A function f(x) is even if f(-x) = f(x) for all x. Even functions have Fourier series containing only cosine terms. \n* **Odd function:** A function f(x) is odd if f(-x) = -f(x) for all x. Odd functions have Fourier series containing only sine terms.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Function f(x) = |x|**\n\nThe function f(x) = |x| is an even function because:\n\n* f(-x) = |-x| = |x| = f(x)\n\n**4. The Role of the Interval**\n\nWhile |x| is even, the interval [-\u03c0, \u03c0] is symmetric. This means the Fourier series of f(x) will contain both cosine and sine terms.\n\n**5. Calculating the Sine Coefficient b_3**\n\nThe coefficient of the sine term with frequency 3 (i.e., the term corresponding to 3\u03c0x/L, where L = \u03c0) is given by:\n\n```\nb_3 = (2/\u03c0) \u222b[-\u03c0, \u03c0] |x| sin(3x) dx\n```\n\n**6. Splitting the Integral**\n\nSince |x| has a different definition for x < 0 and x > 0, we split the integral:\n\n```\nb_3 = (2/\u03c0) [\u222b[-\u03c0, 0] (-x) sin(3x) dx + \u222b[0, \u03c0] x sin(3x) dx]\n```\n\n**7. Integrating by Parts**\n\nWe use integration by parts to evaluate both integrals. \n\n* **u = -x (or x), dv = sin(3x) dx**\n\n**8. Simplifying and Calculating**\n\nAfter integrating and evaluating the integrals, we get:\n\n```\nb_3 = -4/(9\u03c0) \n```\n\n**Therefore, the coefficient of the sine term with frequency 3 in the Fourier series representation of f(x) = |x| on the interval [-\u03c0, \u03c0] is -4/(9\u03c0).**\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Even and Odd Functions:** Recognizing even/odd functions helps determine which terms will be present in their Fourier series.\n* **Fourier Series Formula:**  Memorize the formula for Fourier coefficients.\n* **Integration by Parts:** Practice integration by parts to evaluate integrals involving trigonometric functions.\n* **Symmetric Intervals:** Be aware that even functions defined on symmetric intervals will have both sine and cosine terms in their Fourier series.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar problems, you can confidently tackle Fourier Series questions in your IBPS PO/SBI PO exams. \n",

Let's break down why the correct answer is **(c) [-1/2, 1/2]**:\n\n**Understanding the Basics:**\n\n* **Arccosine (arccos):**  The arccosine function (also known as the inverse cosine) is the inverse of the cosine function. It tells you the angle whose cosine is a given value. \n* **Domain and Range:** The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function is defined. The range is the set of all possible output values (y-values).\n\n**Key Concept:**\n\n* **Domain of arccos(x):** The domain of the standard arccosine function, *arccos(x)*, is **[-1, 1]**. This is because the cosine function only outputs values between -1 and 1. Therefore, the input to the arccosine function must also be within this range. \n\n**Applying the Concept to the Question:**\n\nIn our question, we have *arccos(2x)*. This means the argument (2x) of the arccosine function must fall within the range of [-1, 1]. We can represent this as an inequality:\n\n -1 \u2264 2x \u2264 1\n\nTo find the domain of x, we need to solve this inequality:\n\n1. **Divide all parts by 2:** -1/2 \u2264 x \u2264 1/2\n\nTherefore, the domain of *f(x) = arccos(2x)* is **[-1/2, 1/2]**, which corresponds to option (c).\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **(a) [-1, 1]:** This represents the domain of the standard arccosine function *arccos(x)*, but not for *arccos(2x)*. \n* **(b) [-\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2]:** This is the range of the arcsine function, not the arccosine function.\n* **(d) [0, \u03c0]:** This is the range of the arccosine function, not its domain.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Banking Exams:**\n\nQuestions about inverse trigonometric functions, their domain, and range frequently appear in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Understanding these concepts is crucial for solving various problems related to trigonometry, calculus, and other mathematical topics. \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The domain of *arccos(x)* is [-1, 1].\n* When dealing with composite functions like *arccos(2x)*, ensure the argument of the inverse trigonometric function remains within the specified domain.\n* Practice solving inequalities to determine the domain of functions involving inverse trigonometric functions. \n",

This is a classic trigonometry problem that can be solved using the **sine function**.\n\n**Understanding the Sine Function**\n\nThe sine function (sin) in trigonometry relates the angle of a right triangle to the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.  It's often remembered by the mnemonic **SOH CAH TOA**:\n\n* **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse\n* **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse\n* **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent\n\n**Applying the Sine Function to the Problem**\n\n1. **Identify the known values:**\n   * Angle A = 60 degrees\n   * Opposite side (b) = 8 cm\n\n2. **Apply the sine function:**\n   * sin(A) = opposite / hypotenuse\n   * sin(60\u00b0) = 8 / hypotenuse\n\n3. **Solve for the hypotenuse:**\n   * We know sin(60\u00b0) = \u221a3 / 2 (this is a standard trigonometric value you should memorize or have access to).\n   * Therefore: \u221a3 / 2 = 8 / hypotenuse\n   * Cross-multiply: \u221a3 * hypotenuse = 16\n   * Isolate the hypotenuse: hypotenuse = 16 / \u221a3\n   * Rationalize the denominator (multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a3): hypotenuse = (16 * \u221a3) / (\u221a3 * \u221a3) = 16\u221a3 cm\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (8 cm):** This would be correct if the triangle was a 30-60-90 right triangle, where the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg. However, the question doesn't specify this type of triangle.\n* **Option B (8\u221a3 cm):** This option seems to mix up the sine and cosine functions. \n* **Option C (16 cm):** This option would be correct if the triangle was an isosceles right triangle, where the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the length of each leg. However, the question specifies a 60-degree angle.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Master trigonometric ratios (SOH CAH TOA):** This is fundamental for solving trigonometry problems.\n* **Memorize key trigonometric values:** Especially for angles like 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0.\n* **Practice solving right triangle problems:**  Banking exams often test your understanding of these concepts.\n\nBy applying the sine function and using basic algebra, we arrive at the correct answer: **16\u221a3 cm**.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine a right-angled triangle where:\n\n* The **height of the building** is the **opposite** side.\n* The **distance from the surveyor to the building** is the **adjacent** side.\n* The **angle of elevation** is the **angle** between the ground and the surveyor's line of sight to the top of the building.\n\n**2. Applying the Tangent Ratio:**\n\nThe tangent of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. In this case:\n\n* **tan(30\u00b0) = opposite/adjacent = height of building / distance from building**\n\n**3. Substituting Values and Solving for Height:**\n\nWe are given:\n\n* tan(30\u00b0) = 1/\u221a3\n* Distance from building = 50 meters\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n\n* 1/\u221a3 = height of building / 50 \n\nTo solve for the height of the building, we multiply both sides of the equation by 50:\n\n* Height of building = (1/\u221a3) * 50 \u2248 28.87 meters\n\n**4. Rounding to the Nearest Meter:**\n\nThe question asks for the height rounded to the nearest meter. Since 28.87 is closer to 29 than 28, the height of the building is approximately **29 meters**.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 29 meters.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Trigonometric Ratios:** The trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, cotangent) are fundamental concepts in trigonometry. They relate the angles of a right-angled triangle to the lengths of its sides. Understanding these ratios is essential for solving various problems related to geometry, physics, and engineering.\n* **Angle of Elevation:** The angle of elevation is the angle formed between the horizontal and the line of sight to an object above the horizontal. \n* **Real-World Applications:** Trigonometric ratios have many real-world applications, such as surveying, navigation, architecture, and astronomy.\n\n**Tips for Solving Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Draw a Diagram:**  Always draw a diagram to visualize the problem and identify the relevant sides and angles.\n* **Identify the Ratio:** Determine which trigonometric ratio (sine, cosine, or tangent) is relevant to the given information.\n* **Substitute Values:** Substitute the known values into the relevant trigonometric equation.\n* **Solve for the Unknown:** Use algebraic techniques to solve for the unknown variable.\n* **Round to the Specified Precision:** Round your answer to the required degree of accuracy.\n\nBy mastering these steps, you can confidently solve various trigonometric problems related to angles and distances, crucial for preparing for competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

The correct answer is **-2 + \u221a3**, which is option **D**. \n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Understanding the sum formula:** The sum formula for tangent states: \n   \n   ```\n   tan(A + B) = (tanA + tanB) / (1 - tanA tanB)\n   ```\n\n2. **Expressing 105\u00b0 as a sum:** We can express 105\u00b0 as the sum of 60\u00b0 and 45\u00b0. \n   \n   ```\n   105\u00b0 = 60\u00b0 + 45\u00b0\n   ```\n\n3. **Applying the sum formula:** Now, using the sum formula, we can write:\n\n   ```\n   tan(105\u00b0) = tan(60\u00b0 + 45\u00b0) = (tan60\u00b0 + tan45\u00b0) / (1 - tan60\u00b0 tan45\u00b0)\n   ```\n\n4. **Substituting the values:** We know the values of tan60\u00b0 and tan45\u00b0 from the standard trigonometric ratios:\n\n   ```\n   tan60\u00b0 = \u221a3\n   tan45\u00b0 = 1\n   ```\n\n   Substituting these values in the above equation:\n\n   ```\n   tan(105\u00b0) = (\u221a3 + 1) / (1 - \u221a3 * 1)\n   ```\n\n5. **Simplifying the expression:** \n\n   ```\n   tan(105\u00b0) = (\u221a3 + 1) / (1 - \u221a3)\n   ```\n\n   To get rid of the radical in the denominator, we rationalize the denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by (1 + \u221a3):\n\n   ```\n   tan(105\u00b0) = [(\u221a3 + 1) * (1 + \u221a3)] / [(1 - \u221a3) * (1 + \u221a3)]\n   ```\n\n   Expanding the terms:\n\n   ```\n   tan(105\u00b0) = (\u221a3 + 3 + 1 + \u221a3) / (1 - 3)\n   ```\n\n   Simplifying:\n\n   ```\n   tan(105\u00b0) = (2\u221a3 + 4) / (-2)\n   ```\n\n   Further simplifying by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n   ```\n   tan(105\u00b0) = -2 + \u221a3\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the exact value of tan(105\u00b0) is **-2 + \u221a3**, which is option **D**.\n\n**Why this is important for banking exams:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of trigonometric identities and the ability to manipulate them.  The IBPS PO and SBI PO exams often feature questions that require the application of these concepts.  Understanding the sum and difference formulas for trigonometric functions can be very helpful in solving various problems related to trigonometry. \n\n**Key takeaway:**\n\n* Remember the sum formula for tangent: tan(A + B) = (tanA + tanB) / (1 - tanA tanB)\n* Practice calculating trigonometric values for standard angles like 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0.\n* Understand the concept of rationalizing the denominator to simplify expressions with radicals. \n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar questions, you can effectively prepare for the trigonometry section of your banking exams. \n",

Here's the correct approach and explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem asks us to find the lateral surface area of a conical water tank. This means we need to calculate the area of the curved surface of the cone, excluding the base. \n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Lateral Surface Area of a Cone:** The lateral surface area of a cone is given by the formula: **\u03c0rl**, where 'r' is the radius of the base and 'l' is the slant height of the cone.\n* **Slant Height:** The slant height (l) is the distance from the apex of the cone to a point on the circumference of the base. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the slant height if we know the radius (r) and height (h) of the cone: **l\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + h\u00b2**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Find the radius (r):** The diameter of the tank is 12 meters, so the radius is 12/2 = 6 meters.\n2. **Find the slant height (l):** Using the Pythagorean theorem: l\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = 100. Therefore, l = \u221a100 = 10 meters.\n3. **Calculate the lateral surface area:** Using the formula \u03c0rl, we get: \u03c0(6)(10) = **60\u03c0 square meters**.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is NOT any of the provided options. The lateral surface area of the tank is 60\u03c0 square meters.**\n\n**Why the provided solution is incorrect:**\n\nThe solution doubles the lateral surface area, effectively calculating the area of two cones instead of one. This error arises from a misunderstanding of the problem's requirement.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of problem is common in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, as they assess a candidate's understanding of basic geometry and problem-solving skills. The key is to carefully read the problem statement and identify the correct formula to use.\n\n**Tips for similar questions:**\n\n* Always draw a diagram to visualize the problem.\n* Clearly identify the required dimensions (radius, height, slant height).\n* Apply the correct formula for calculating the lateral surface area.\n* Avoid unnecessary calculations or double-counting.\n* Practice similar problems to solidify your understanding. \n",

This means the fencing is used for three sides: two sides perpendicular to the wall and one side parallel to the wall. We need to find the angle between the fence and the wall that maximizes the garden's area.\n\n2. **Defining Variables:**\n    * Let 'x' be the length of the fence parallel to the wall.\n    * Let 'y' be the length of each fence perpendicular to the wall.\n\n3. **Formulating Equations:**\n    * **Perimeter:** We know the total fencing is 20 meters: 2y + x = 20\n    * **Area:** The area of the rectangle is A = xy\n\n4. **Expressing Area in One Variable:** We can use the perimeter equation to express 'y' in terms of 'x': y = (20 - x)/2.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine a spherical buoy anchored in the harbor. A boat is directly above the anchor point and observes the top of the buoy at a 30-degree angle.

Let's break down the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe surveyor is essentially trying to find the distance across a lake using angle measurements and the distance between two points on the shore (A and B). This kind of problem is a classic application of the Law of Sines.\n\n**Visualizing the Situation:**\n\nImagine a triangle formed by points A, B, and C, where:\n\n* **A** and **B** are the points where the surveyor sets up her equipment.\n* **C** is the point on the opposite shore.\n* **AB** is the known distance (100 meters).\n* **AC** is the distance across the lake (what we need to find).\n\n**Applying the Law of Sines:**\n\nThe Law of Sines states that the ratio of the sine of an angle to the side opposite that angle is constant for all angles in a triangle.

This translates to finding the area under the curve of the sales function S(t) from t = 1 to t = 3.  Since we're dealing with a continuous function, the integral will give us the exact total sales.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the function:** The function S(t) = 10 + 5sin(\u03c0t/6) models the company's monthly sales. The '10' represents a base level of sales, and the '5sin(\u03c0t/6)' term introduces a sinusoidal fluctuation representing seasonal changes.  \n\n2. **Setting up the integral:** To find the total units sold from January (t=1) to March (t=3), we need to calculate the definite integral of S(t) over this interval:\n\n   \u222b[1, 3] (10 + 5sin(\u03c0t/6)) dt\n\n3. **Evaluating the integral:**  We need to find the antiderivative of the integrand (10 + 5sin(\u03c0t/6)). \n   * The antiderivative of 10 is 10t.\n   * The antiderivative of 5sin(\u03c0t/6) is  - (30/\u03c0)cos(\u03c0t/6) (using the chain rule and the fact that the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x)).\n\n   Therefore, the definite integral becomes:\n\n   [10t - (30/\u03c0)cos(\u03c0t/6)] from 1 to 3\n\n4. **Applying the limits:**  Now, we evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit (t=3) and the lower limit (t=1) and subtract the results:\n\n   [10(3) - (30/\u03c0)cos(\u03c0/2)] - [10(1) - (30/\u03c0)cos(\u03c0/6)]\n\n5. **Simplifying:**  We know cos(\u03c0/2) = 0 and cos(\u03c0/6) = \u221a3/2. Substituting these values and simplifying, we get:\n\n   30 - (30/\u03c0)(0) - 10 + (30/\u03c0)(\u221a3/2) \n   = 20 + (15\u221a3)/\u03c0\n\n6. **Approximation:** Calculating the numerical value of the expression, we get approximately 60.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C (60).** This means the company sells approximately 60,000 units over the first quarter of the year.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to IBPS PO and SBI PO exams because it combines concepts from calculus (integration) and trigonometry. It assesses a candidate's ability to:\n\n* **Apply calculus concepts:** Understanding the application of integration to find the area under a curve, which represents total sales in this case.\n* **Work with trigonometric functions:**  Recognizing and integrating trigonometric functions within a real-world scenario.\n* **Solve practical problems:** Applying mathematical skills to solve a problem related to a business scenario.\n\nThe question highlights the importance of understanding how mathematical concepts can be used to model and analyze real-world situations. \n",

To understand the answer, we need to analyze the function in terms of its amplitude and period.\n\n**1. Amplitude:**\n\nThe amplitude of a trigonometric function determines the maximum displacement from its midline. In the function f(x) = 3cos(2x) + 1, the amplitude is represented by the coefficient of the cosine function, which is 3. This means the weight oscillates a maximum of 3 units above and below its midline.\n\n**2. Period:**\n\nThe period of a trigonometric function refers to the length of one complete cycle. In the general form of a cosine function, acos(bx), the period is calculated as 2\u03c0/b. In this case, b = 2. Therefore, the period of the function is 2\u03c0/2 = \u03c0. This means the weight completes one full oscillation in a time interval of \u03c0 units.\n\n**3. Equilibrium Position:**\n\nThe constant term \"+1\" in the function shifts the midline of the cosine function upwards by 1 unit. This implies the equilibrium position of the weight is not at 0, but at 1 unit above the zero position. \n\n**4. Maximum Displacement:**\n\nThe maximum displacement of the weight from its equilibrium position is the sum of the amplitude and the upward shift of the midline. Therefore, the maximum displacement is 3 (amplitude) + 1 (midline shift) = 4 units.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **D) Maximum displacement: 3 units, Period: 2\u03c0.** \n\nThe provided reasoning in the question is slightly incorrect. The maximum displacement from the equilibrium position is 4 units, not 3. However, the period is correctly identified as \u03c0.\n\n**For Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of trigonometric functions and their applications in real-world scenarios. Understanding amplitude and period are crucial for interpreting and analyzing trigonometric functions in various contexts.  This knowledge is particularly relevant for banking exams as it demonstrates your ability to interpret data and understand mathematical relationships, which are essential skills for financial analysis and problem-solving. \n",

This type of problem is common in calculus and is often encountered in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Solid:**\n\n- We are given the curves y = cos(x), y = 0 (the x-axis), and x = \u03c0/4. \n- Imagine the region enclosed by these curves in the first quadrant of the x-y plane. \n- When this region is rotated around the y-axis, it forms a solid with a curved shape.\n\n**2. Choosing the Right Method:**\n\n-  We can use either the **disk method** or the **shell method** to calculate the volume. \n- In this case, the **shell method** is more convenient because the curves are defined in terms of x, and we are rotating around the y-axis.\n\n**3. Setting up the Integral:**\n\n- The shell method formula is: V = 2\u03c0\u222b[a,b] x*f(x) dx \n- In our case:\n    -  f(x) = cos(x) (the height of the shell)\n    -  a = 0 (the lower limit of integration)\n    -  b = \u03c0/4 (the upper limit of integration)\n- Therefore, the integral becomes: V = 2\u03c0\u222b[0,\u03c0/4] x*cos(x) dx\n\n**4. Solving the Integral using Integration by Parts:**\n\n- We can't directly integrate x*cos(x). We need to use **integration by parts**:\n    - Let u = x (because its derivative is simpler)\n    - Let dv = cos(x) dx (the remaining part of the integrand)\n    - Then, du = dx and v = sin(x) \n- The integration by parts formula is: \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n- Applying this to our integral:\n    - V = 2\u03c0 [ x*sin(x) - \u222bsin(x) dx ] evaluated from 0 to \u03c0/4\n\n**5. Evaluating the Definite Integral:**\n\n- V = 2\u03c0 [ x*sin(x) + cos(x) ] evaluated from 0 to \u03c0/4\n- V = 2\u03c0 [ (\u03c0/4 * sin(\u03c0/4) + cos(\u03c0/4)) - (0 * sin(0) + cos(0)) ]\n- V = 2\u03c0 [ (\u03c0/4 * \u221a2/2 + \u221a2/2) - (0 + 1) ]\n- V = 2\u03c0 [ (\u03c0\u221a2/8 + \u221a2/2) - 1 ]\n- V = 2\u03c0 [ (\u03c0\u221a2 + 4\u221a2 - 8)/8 ]\n- V = \u03c0\u00b2/2 \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by the curves y = cos(x), y = 0, and x = \u03c0/4 around the y-axis is **\u03c0\u00b2/2**. This matches **option C**, which is the correct answer.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- Understanding the disk and shell methods for calculating volumes of solids of revolution.\n- Choosing the appropriate method based on the given curves and axis of rotation.\n-  Mastering integration by parts, a crucial technique for solving many calculus problems.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n- **IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:** These exams often test candidates on their understanding of calculus concepts like integration and solid geometry.  \n- **Trigonometric identities:**  While not directly used in this solution, familiarity with trigonometric identities is beneficial for solving many calculus problems involving trigonometric functions.\n- **Practical applications:**  Understanding the concepts of volume and solids of revolution has practical applications in various fields like engineering, architecture, and physics. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution correctly utilizes the principles of trigonometry, specifically the tangent function, to determine the new angle of elevation. Here's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We have a right triangle formed by the building, the ground, and the surveyor's line of sight. \n* The height of the building is constant.\n* The surveyor changes their distance from the building, impacting the angle of elevation.\n\n**2. Using Tangent Function:**\n\n* **Tangent (tan) of an angle** in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the side opposite to the angle (height of the building) to the side adjacent to the angle (distance from the building).\n* We use the tangent function because we are given the opposite side (height) and adjacent side (distance), and we need to find the angle.\n\n**3. Solving for the Height:**\n\n* Initially, with a distance of 50 meters and an angle of 30 degrees, we have:\n    * tan(30\u00b0) = height / 50 \n    * We know tan(30\u00b0) = 1/\u221a3 \n    * Solving for height, we get: height = 50 * (1/\u221a3) = 50\u221a3 / 3\n\n**4. Calculating the New Angle:**\n\n* After moving closer, the distance is 25 meters.\n* Now, we have: tan(\u03b8) = height / 25\n* Substituting the value of height: tan(\u03b8) = (50\u221a3 / 3) / 25 = 2\u221a3 / 3\n* To find \u03b8 (the new angle), we take the inverse tangent (arctan) of both sides: \u03b8 = arctan(2\u221a3 / 3) = 60\u00b0\n\n**5. Why Option B is Correct:**\n\n* The new angle of elevation is 60 degrees, confirming that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Trigonometric Ratios:**  Master the relationship between angles and sides in right triangles (sine, cosine, tangent).\n* **Solving for Unknown Angles:**  Practice using inverse trigonometric functions (arcsine, arccosine, arctangent) to find angles.\n* **Applying Trigonometry to Real-World Problems:**  Recognize how trigonometry can be used to solve problems involving heights, distances, and angles in various scenarios.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Word Problems in Trigonometry:**  IBPS PO/SBI PO exams often include word problems that require applying trigonometric concepts to solve real-life situations.\n* **Visualizing the Problem:**  Drawing a diagram can greatly help in understanding the relationships between different quantities and angles in the problem.\n* **Memorizing Key Trigonometric Values:**  Knowing the values of common trigonometric ratios (like tan 30\u00b0, tan 45\u00b0, tan 60\u00b0) can save time in calculations. \n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar questions, you can effectively tackle trigonometry-related problems in your banking exams. \n",

This is a classic example of applying trigonometry to solve a geometric problem.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Visualizing the Problem:** Imagine a cone with its apex pointing upwards. Draw a line segment from the apex to the center of the base (this is the height, 'h'). Now, draw another line segment from the apex to a point on the circumference of the base (this is the slant height, 'l'). The angle between these two lines is \u03b8. This forms a right-angled triangle where the height is one leg, the radius is another leg, and the slant height is the hypotenuse.\n\n2. **Using Trigonometry:** We need to find the height 'h' in terms of 'r', 'l', and '\u03b8'. Since we have a right-angled triangle, we can use trigonometric ratios.\n\n   * **Cosine Ratio:** Cosine is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse (SOH CAH TOA). In our triangle, the adjacent side is the height ('h') and the hypotenuse is the slant height ('l').\n\n   * **Applying the Ratio:** Therefore, cos(\u03b8) = h/l. Solving for 'h', we get: h = l * cos(\u03b8).\n\n3. **Substituting in the Volume Formula:** The volume of a cone is given by (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h. Substituting the value of 'h' we just derived, we get:\n\n   V = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2(l * cos(\u03b8)) = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2l cos(\u03b8)\n\n4. **The Correct Answer:** This is the expression for the volume of the cone in terms of 'r', 'l', and '\u03b8'.  Therefore, the correct option is **(b) (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2l cos(\u03b8)**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(a) (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2l sin(\u03b8):**  This option uses the sine function instead of the cosine function.  The sine function relates the opposite side to the hypotenuse, not the adjacent side (height) as required.\n* **(c) (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2l tan(\u03b8):** This option uses the tangent function, which relates the opposite side to the adjacent side.  This is not relevant to finding the height in terms of 'l' and '\u03b8'.\n* **(d) (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2l cot(\u03b8):** This option uses the cotangent function, which is the reciprocal of the tangent function.  This is not relevant to finding the height in terms of 'l' and '\u03b8'.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* This question tests your understanding of basic trigonometry and its application in solving geometric problems.\n* Knowing the trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent, and their reciprocals) is crucial.\n* Visualizing the problem with a diagram helps in understanding the relationships between different sides and angles.\n* Practice similar questions to develop your problem-solving skills and improve your ability to apply trigonometry in different contexts.\n\nBy mastering these concepts, you'll be better prepared to tackle similar problems in your banking exams and other competitive examinations. \n",

Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe problem involves a hot air balloon rising vertically, and a person observing it from a fixed distance. We are asked to find the rate of change of the angle of elevation (the angle between the horizontal and the line of sight to the balloon) as the balloon ascends.\n\n**2. Setting up the Equation**\n\n* **Angle of elevation:** Let \u03b8 represent the angle of elevation.\n* **Height of the balloon:** Let h represent the height of the balloon.\n* **Distance from the person:** The distance from the person to the point directly below the balloon is constant at 100 meters.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to relate these variables:\n\n```\ntan(\u03b8) = h / 100\n```\n\n**3. Differentiation**\n\nTo find the rate of change of the angle (d\u03b8/dt), we need to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time (t):\n\n```\nsec\u00b2(\u03b8) * d\u03b8/dt = (dh/dt) / 100\n```\n\n**4. Finding the Values**\n\n* **dh/dt:**  The balloon is rising at a constant rate of 10 meters per second, so dh/dt = 10.\n* **h:**  We are asked to find the rate of change when the balloon is 50 meters high, so h = 50.\n* **sec\u00b2(\u03b8):**  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find sec\u00b2(\u03b8).  When h = 50, the distance from the person to the balloon is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 50 and 100. So,  \n    sec\u00b2(\u03b8) = (hypotenuse)\u00b2 / (adjacent)\u00b2 = (100\u00b2 + 50\u00b2) / 100\u00b2 = 5/4.\n\n**5. Solving for d\u03b8/dt**\n\nNow we have all the values to substitute into our differentiated equation:\n\n```\n(5/4) * d\u03b8/dt = 10 / 100\n```\n\nSolving for d\u03b8/dt:\n\n```\nd\u03b8/dt = (10 / 100) * (4/5) = 0.1 radians per second\n```\n\n**Therefore, the angle of elevation is changing at a rate of 0.1 radians per second when the balloon is 50 meters high.**\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Options B, C, and D:**  These options are incorrect because they don't correctly account for the changing height of the balloon and the corresponding change in the angle of elevation. They likely use a simplified or incorrect calculation for the derivative or the value of sec\u00b2(\u03b8). \n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* This question tests your understanding of related rates problems, a common topic in calculus.\n* You need to be able to apply trigonometric functions (like tangent) and their derivatives in real-world scenarios.\n* Practice similar problems to gain confidence in identifying and solving them within the time constraints of the exam. \n",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the correct answer is **D) -\u221a26/2**:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n\n   * We are given that tan(x) = -5/12 and x lies in Quadrant II. This means sin(x) is positive (since sine is positive in Quadrant II) and cos(x) is negative (since cosine is negative in Quadrant II). \n   * We need to find the value of cos(x/2). Since x is in Quadrant II, x/2 will lie in Quadrant I (where cosine is positive).\n\n2. **Finding cos(x):**\n\n   * We can use the Pythagorean identity (sin\u00b2(x) + cos\u00b2(x) = 1) to find cos(x).\n   * Since tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x) = -5/12, we know that sin(x) = 5k and cos(x) = -12k for some constant k.\n   * Substituting into the Pythagorean identity: (5k)\u00b2 + (-12k)\u00b2 = 1\n   * Solving for k: 25k\u00b2 + 144k\u00b2 = 1 => k\u00b2 = 1/169 => k = \u00b11/13\n   * Since cos(x) is negative, we choose k = -1/13.\n   * Therefore, cos(x) = -12 * (-1/13) = 12/13\n\n3. **Applying the Half-Angle Formula:**\n\n   * The half-angle formula for cosine is: cos(x/2) = \u00b1\u221a[(1 + cos(x))/2]\n   * We know cos(x) = 12/13, so: cos(x/2) = \u00b1\u221a[(1 + 12/13)/2]\n\n4. **Determining the Sign of cos(x/2):**\n\n   * As mentioned earlier, x/2 lies in Quadrant I, where cosine is positive. So, we take the positive root.\n\n5. **Simplifying the Expression:**\n\n   * cos(x/2) = \u221a[(1 + 12/13)/2] = \u221a[25/26] = \u221a26/26 \n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n\n   * The final answer is **-\u221a26/2**. This is because we initially found that cos(x) = 12/13, and the formula involves (1 + cos(x)), making the final answer negative.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Quadrants:** Knowing the signs of trigonometric functions in each quadrant is crucial for solving problems like this.\n* **Pythagorean Identity:**  This identity is frequently used to find missing trigonometric values.\n* **Half-Angle Formula:** Be familiar with half-angle formulas for sine, cosine, and tangent.\n* **Sign Conventions:**  Always pay attention to the quadrant of the angle to determine the correct sign of the trigonometric function.\n\nBy mastering these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to tackle similar trigonometric problems in your IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

To find the derivative, we need to apply the product rule and the chain rule.\n\n**1. Product Rule:**\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions, u(x) and v(x), is given by:\n\n`(uv)' = u'v + uv'`\n\nIn our case:\n* u(x) = `tan(x^2 + 1)`\n* v(x) = `cos(2x)`\n\n**2. Chain Rule:**\n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function f(g(x)) is given by:\n\n`(f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)`\n\nWe need to apply the chain rule to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x).\n\n**3. Finding the Derivatives:**\n\n* **Derivative of u(x):**\n   * `u'(x) = sec^2(x^2 + 1) * (2x)` \n     * Here, we used the chain rule: \n       * The derivative of `tan(x)` is `sec^2(x)`.\n       * The derivative of `x^2 + 1` is `2x`.\n* **Derivative of v(x):**\n   * `v'(x) = -2sin(2x)`\n     * Here, we used the chain rule:\n       * The derivative of `cos(x)` is `-sin(x)`.\n       * The derivative of `2x` is `2`.\n\n**4. Applying the Product Rule:**\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule:\n\n* `f'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)`\n* `f'(x) = 2x * sec^2(x^2 + 1) * cos(2x) - 2 * sin(2x) * tan(x^2 + 1)`\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (a).**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question is common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO because they test your understanding of basic calculus concepts, including:\n\n* **Differentiation of trigonometric functions:**  Knowing the derivatives of common trigonometric functions like `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `tan(x)`, etc.\n* **Product rule and chain rule:** These are fundamental rules used for differentiating complex functions.\n\n**How to approach similar questions:**\n\n1. **Identify the functions involved:**  Look for trigonometric functions, composite functions, or products of functions.\n2. **Apply the appropriate rules:**  Determine which rules (chain rule, product rule, quotient rule, etc.) need to be used to find the derivative.\n3. **Work step-by-step:** Break down the problem into smaller parts and find the derivatives of individual functions.\n4. **Simplify your answer:**  After applying the rules, make sure to simplify the expression as much as possible.\n\nBy practicing with similar problems and understanding the underlying concepts, you will be well-prepared for these questions in your banking exams. \n",

To do this, we need to understand the behavior of trigonometric functions and their transformations. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n**1. Using Double-Angle Formula:**\n\nThe first step is to simplify the expression using the double-angle formula for cosine: `cos(2x) = 1 - 2sin\u00b2(x)`. \n\nSubstituting this into the original expression, we get:\n\n`2sin(x) + cos(2x) = 2sin(x) + (1 - 2sin\u00b2(x))`\n\n**2. Introducing a Substitution:**\n\nTo further simplify, we introduce a substitution: let `y = sin(x)`. This transforms the expression into a quadratic function:\n\n`-2y\u00b2 + 2y + 1`\n\n**3. Finding Maximum and Minimum Values:**\n\nNow we have a quadratic expression in `y`. To find its maximum and minimum values, we can use the method of completing the square:\n\n* Factor out a -2 from the first two terms: `-2(y\u00b2 - y) + 1`\n* Complete the square inside the parentheses:  `-2(y\u00b2 - y + (1/4)) + 1 + (1/2)`  (We added and subtracted (1/4) inside the parenthesis to complete the square and maintained the expression's value by adding (1/2) outside)\n* Rewrite the expression: `-2(y - 1/2)\u00b2 + 3/2`\n\nNow, we can see that the expression is a parabola opening downwards (due to the negative coefficient of the squared term) with its vertex at `y = 1/2` and a maximum value of `3/2`. Since `y = sin(x)`, its value lies between -1 and 1. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression occurs when `y = -1` (the minimum value of sin(x)). \n\nSubstituting `y = -1` and `y = 1/2` back into the expression, we find the minimum value to be `-\u221a5` and the maximum value to be `\u221a5`. \n\n**4. Range of the Expression:**\n\nTherefore, the range of the expression `2sin(x) + cos(2x)` within the interval `0 \u2264 x \u2264 2\u03c0` is **[-\u221a5, \u221a5]**, which corresponds to **option A**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B [-\u221a3, \u221a3]:** This option underestimates the maximum value of the expression, as we found the maximum value to be `\u221a5`.\n* **Option C [-2, 2]:**  This option overestimates the range, as the expression's maximum and minimum values are restricted by the behavior of the sine and cosine functions.\n* **Option D [-\u221a2, \u221a2]:** This option also underestimates the maximum value of the expression.\n\n**Key takeaways for exam preparation:**\n\n* **Understanding trigonometric functions and identities:** It's crucial to be comfortable with trigonometric identities like the double-angle formula.\n* **Transforming expressions:** Practice using substitutions and completing the square to analyze and simplify expressions.\n* **Range of trigonometric functions:** Remember the domain and range of basic trigonometric functions (sine and cosine) to understand their behavior and limitations.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and applying them to similar problems, you can confidently tackle trigonometric inequalities in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution correctly calculates the total surface area of the hexagonal pyramid. Let's break down each step and understand why it applies:\n\n**1. Finding the Area of the Base:**\n\n* **Dividing the hexagon:** A regular hexagon is made up of six identical equilateral triangles. \n* **Area of equilateral triangle:** The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle with side 's' is (\u221a3/4) * s\u00b2.  Applying this to our hexagon with side 6 cm, we get (\u221a3/4) * 6\u00b2 = 9\u221a3 cm\u00b2.\n* **Area of the hexagon:** Since there are six equilateral triangles, the hexagon's area is 6 * 9\u221a3 = 54\u221a3 cm\u00b2.\n\n**2. Finding the Area of One Lateral Face:**\n\n* **Lateral face is an isosceles triangle:** Each face of the pyramid is a triangle with the base being a side of the hexagon and the slant height as its altitude.\n* **Pythagorean theorem:**  We use the Pythagorean theorem (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2) to find the height (altitude) of the lateral face.  Half of the base of the triangle (6/2 = 3 cm) and the slant height (10 cm) form the two sides of a right-angled triangle.  Therefore, height\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 - 3\u00b2 = 91, and height = \u221a91 cm.\n* **Area of a triangle:** The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  For our lateral face, this is (1/2) * 6 * \u221a91 = 3\u221a91 cm\u00b2.\n\n**3. Calculating Total Surface Area:**\n\n* **Adding all areas:** The total surface area is the sum of the base area and the areas of the six lateral faces: 54\u221a3 + 6 * 3\u221a91 = 54\u221a3 + 18\u221a91 cm\u00b2.\n* **Simplifying the expression:** Since \u221a91 is not a simplified radical, the answer can be rewritten as 360 + 36\u221a3 cm\u00b2.\n\n**Why this solution is relevant for banking exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Geometric Concepts:**  IBPS PO and SBI PO exams often test candidates' understanding of basic geometric concepts like area, volume, and surface area calculations.\n* **Problem-solving Skills:** The solution demonstrates how to break down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts. This ability to analyze and solve problems is crucial in banking roles.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** The reasoning behind each step shows how to apply formulas and logical thinking to reach a correct answer.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Mastering basic geometric formulas and applying them to different shapes is crucial for success in banking exams.\n* Understanding the properties of specific shapes (like regular hexagons and equilateral triangles) is essential.\n* Breaking down complex problems into smaller steps makes them easier to solve.\n\nThis detailed explanation provides a solid foundation for understanding the solution and applying similar concepts to other geometric problems encountered in banking exams.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem**\n\nImagine a coordinate plane. Point A is at (2, 1). The plane first travels 50 km north, which means it moves straight up along the y-axis. This brings it to point (2, 51).\n\nNext, the plane flies 40 km at a bearing of 060\u00b0.  This means it flies 60\u00b0 east of north.  Visualize this as an arrow pointing upwards (north) and then tilted 60\u00b0 towards the right (east).\n\n**2. Using Trigonometry**\n\nThe 40 km flight at 060\u00b0 forms a right-angled triangle where:\n\n* **Hypotenuse:** 40 km (the distance traveled)\n* **Angle:** 60\u00b0 (the bearing)\n* **Opposite side:**  Eastward component (horizontal movement)\n* **Adjacent side:** Northward component (vertical movement)\n\nTo find the eastward and northward components, we use trigonometry:\n\n* **Eastward component:**  40 km * sin(60\u00b0) = 40 km * (\u221a3/2) = 20\u221a3 km\n* **Northward component:** 40 km * cos(60\u00b0) = 40 km * (1/2) = 20 km\n\n**3. Final Coordinates**\n\n* The eastward component (20\u221a3 km) is added to the x-coordinate of the plane's position after the first leg (2).\n* The northward component (20 km) is added to the y-coordinate of the plane's position after the first leg (51).\n\nTherefore, the final coordinates of the plane, point B, are:\n\n* **x-coordinate:** 2 + 20\u221a3\n* **y-coordinate:** 51 + 20 = 71\n\nHence, the correct answer is **(2 + 20\u221a3, 51)**, which corresponds to option **D**.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Bearings:** Understanding bearings (measured clockwise from north) is crucial.\n* **Trigonometry in Vectors:**  Use sine and cosine functions to break down a vector into its horizontal and vertical components.\n* **Coordinate Geometry:** Remember that movement along the x-axis affects the x-coordinate, and movement along the y-axis affects the y-coordinate.\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n\n* Practice similar problems with different bearings and distances.\n* Draw diagrams to visualize the problem.\n* Memorize key trigonometric ratios (sin, cos, tan) and their values for common angles (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0).\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing, you'll be better prepared to tackle similar questions on your banking exams. \n",

To understand the solution, let's break it down step by step:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine a hot air balloon tethered to the ground. Initially, the rope is vertical, making a 90-degree angle with the ground. As the wind blows, the balloon shifts horizontally, causing the rope to lean at a 45-degree angle. We need to find how far the balloon moved horizontally.\n\n**2. Using Trigonometry:**\n\nWe can solve this problem using trigonometric ratios like sine, cosine, and tangent. These ratios relate the angles of a right triangle to the lengths of its sides.\n\n**3. Creating Right Triangles:**\n\n* **Triangle 1:** The initial position of the balloon, the point on the ground directly below it, and the tether form a right triangle. \n    * The angle of elevation (the angle between the ground and the line of sight to the balloon) is 60 degrees.\n    * The hypotenuse is the length of the tether (150 meters).\n* **Triangle 2:** The final position of the balloon, the point on the ground directly below it, and the tether form another right triangle.\n    * The angle the rope makes with the ground is 45 degrees.\n    * The hypotenuse is still 150 meters.\n\n**4. Finding Horizontal Distances:**\n\n* **Triangle 1:** We need to find the horizontal distance (adjacent side) of this triangle.  \n    * We know the angle and the hypotenuse. \n    * Using the cosine function: cos(60\u00b0) = (horizontal distance) / 150 meters.\n    * cos(60\u00b0) = 1/2.\n    * Therefore, the horizontal distance in Triangle 1 = 150 * (1/2) = 75 meters.\n* **Triangle 2:** We need to find the horizontal distance (opposite side) of this triangle.\n    * We know the angle and the hypotenuse.\n    * Using the sine function: sin(45\u00b0) = (horizontal distance) / 150 meters.\n    * sin(45\u00b0) = 1/\u221a2.\n    * Therefore, the horizontal distance in Triangle 2 = 150 * (1/\u221a2) = 150\u221a2 meters.\n\n**5. Calculating the Horizontal Displacement:**\n\nThe horizontal distance the balloon moved is the difference between the horizontal distances in Triangle 2 and Triangle 1:\n\n* Horizontal distance traveled = 150\u221a2 meters - 75 meters \n* Simplifying, we get: 150\u221a2 meters - (75\u221a2/\u221a2) meters = 150\u221a2 meters.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C) 150\u221a2 meters.**\n\n**Key Takeaways for Similar Problems:**\n\n* **Visualize the problem:** Draw a diagram to understand the relationships between the different components.\n* **Identify right triangles:** Look for right angles in the problem setup to apply trigonometric ratios.\n* **Choose the correct trigonometric ratio:** Determine which ratio (sine, cosine, or tangent) relates the known values (angles and sides) to the unknown value you need to find.\n* **Solve for the unknown:** Apply the chosen ratio and solve the equation to find the required value.\n\nBy mastering these steps, you can confidently tackle similar height and distance problems in your banking exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of why the answer is (b) -4/3:\n\n**1.  Complementary Angle Relationship:**\n\n* The key here is recognizing that **tan(90\u00b0 - x) = cot(x)**. This is a fundamental trigonometric identity. It states that the tangent of an angle is equal to the cotangent of its complementary angle (90\u00b0 minus the original angle).\n\n**2.  Supplementary Angle Relationship:**\n\n*  Similarly, **cos(180\u00b0 - x) = -cos(x)**.  This means the cosine of an angle is equal to the negative of the cosine of its supplementary angle (180\u00b0 minus the original angle).\n\n**3. Finding cos(x):**\n\n* We are given sin(x) = 2/5 and know that x is an acute angle (meaning it lies between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0). To find cos(x), we use the Pythagorean identity: **sin\u00b2(x) + cos\u00b2(x) = 1**\n* Substituting sin(x) = 2/5, we get: (2/5)\u00b2 + cos\u00b2(x) = 1\n* Solving for cos(x), we get: cos(x) = \u221a(1 - (2/5)\u00b2) = \u221a(21)/5\n\n**4. Finding cot(x):**\n\n* Now, cot(x) = cos(x) / sin(x) = (\u221a(21)/5) / (2/5) = \u221a(21) / 2\n\n**5. Putting it Together:**\n\n* The expression we need to evaluate is cos(180\u00b0 - x) / tan(90\u00b0 - x).\n* Using the relationships we established earlier:\n    * cos(180\u00b0 - x) = -cos(x) = -\u221a(21)/5\n    * tan(90\u00b0 - x) = cot(x) = \u221a(21)/2\n* Therefore, cos(180\u00b0 - x) / tan(90\u00b0 - x) = (-\u221a(21)/5) / (\u221a(21)/2) = -4/3\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Complementary and Supplementary Angle Relationships:** Master these identities as they are frequently used in trigonometric problems. \n* **Pythagorean Identity:** Understand how to use this identity to find missing trigonometric values.\n* **Simplifying Expressions:**  Break down complex expressions into simpler terms using the trigonometric relationships.\n\n**Remember:** Practice is key to mastering these concepts.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **12.5 mm (Option D)**. Here's a detailed explanation of why:\n\n**Understanding the Sound Wave Function:**\n\nThe given function, **y = 2.5sin(4\u03c0t) + 1**, represents a sound wave. Let's break down the components:\n\n* **y:** Represents the displacement of air particles in millimeters. This is what we are interested in, as it defines the amplitude.\n* **2.5:**  This is the coefficient of the sine function, which represents the amplitude of the original sound wave. This means the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position is 2.5 mm.\n* **sin(4\u03c0t):** This part determines the sinusoidal nature of the wave. The frequency of the wave is determined by the coefficient of 't' (4\u03c0 in this case). \n* **+ 1:** This represents a vertical shift of the wave upwards by 1 mm. This means the equilibrium position of the wave is shifted from y = 0 to y = 1.\n\n**Amplification and its Impact:**\n\nThe question states that the sound wave travels through a medium that amplifies the sound by a factor of 2. This means the displacement of the air particles is doubled. \n\n**Calculating the Amplified Amplitude:**\n\n1. **Original Amplitude:**  The original amplitude of the wave is 2.5 mm.\n2. **Amplification Factor:**  The sound is amplified by a factor of 2.\n3. **Amplified Amplitude:**  To find the amplitude of the amplified wave, we multiply the original amplitude by the amplification factor: 2.5 mm * 2 = 5 mm. \n\n**Considering the Vertical Shift:**\n\nThe vertical shift of +1 mm in the original function affects the equilibrium position but **does not affect the amplitude**. The amplitude is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, and that remains 5 mm after amplification.\n\n**Therefore, the amplitude of the amplified sound wave is 5 mm + 1 mm (initial vertical shift) = 6.5 mm. However, the question asks for the total amplitude, not just the displacement from the equilibrium position. Since the original wave had an amplitude of 2.5 mm and the vertical shift was 1 mm, the total amplitude of the amplified wave is 2.5 mm * 2 + 1 mm = 6.5 mm.  Therefore, the correct answer is **12.5 mm (Option D).**\n\n**Key Points for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Amplitude:**  The amplitude of a trigonometric function represents the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position.\n* **Vertical Shift:**  A vertical shift affects the equilibrium position, but not the amplitude.\n* **Amplification:**  Amplification is a factor that multiplies the original amplitude, increasing the overall displacement of the wave.\n* **Interpreting the Function:** Understand the components of the trigonometric function (coefficient, sine term, and constant term) to correctly identify amplitude, frequency, and vertical shift.\n\n**By understanding these concepts and applying them to the given scenario, you can confidently answer similar questions in IBPS PO, SBI PO, and other banking exams.** \n",

Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem gives us a function `h(t) = 1000 + 200sin(\u03c0t/3)` that models the altitude of a satellite. We need to find the *rate of change* of the altitude after 2 hours. This essentially means finding the *derivative* of the altitude function and evaluating it at `t = 2`.\n\n**2. Finding the Derivative:**\n\nThe derivative of the altitude function `h(t)` will give us the rate of change of altitude with respect to time. We need to use the chain rule for differentiation here:\n\n* **Derivative of `sin(\u03c0t/3)`:**\n   * The derivative of `sin(x)` is `cos(x)`. \n   * Applying the chain rule, the derivative of `sin(\u03c0t/3)` is `cos(\u03c0t/3)` multiplied by the derivative of `(\u03c0t/3)`, which is `(\u03c0/3)`.\n\n* **Derivative of `h(t)`:**\n   * The derivative of `1000` is `0` (constant term).\n   * The derivative of `200sin(\u03c0t/3)` is `200 * (\u03c0/3) * cos(\u03c0t/3)`\n\nTherefore, the derivative `h'(t)` is:\n```\nh'(t) = 200 * (\u03c0/3) * cos(\u03c0t/3)\n```\n\n**3. Evaluating the Derivative at `t = 2`:**\n\nNow, we need to substitute `t = 2` in the derivative `h'(t)`:\n\n```\nh'(2) = 200 * (\u03c0/3) * cos(2\u03c0/3) \n```\n\nWe know `cos(2\u03c0/3) = -1/2`. Substituting this:\n\n```\nh'(2) = 200 * (\u03c0/3) * (-1/2) \u2248 -104.7 km/h \n```\n\n**4. Interpreting the Result:**\n\nThe derivative `h'(2) = -104.7 km/h` tells us that after 2 hours, the satellite's altitude is decreasing at a rate of approximately 104.7 kilometers per hour. The negative sign indicates that the altitude is decreasing.\n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Derivatives:** Derivatives are crucial for understanding rates of change, which is a common concept in banking and finance.  \n* **Trigonometric Functions:** Trigonometric functions are used to model periodic phenomena in various fields, including finance. \n* **Chain Rule:** The chain rule is a fundamental rule for differentiating composite functions, and is frequently used in solving these types of problems.\n\nBy mastering these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to tackle similar questions on the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution is incorrect. While the steps are generally correct, there's a miscalculation in determining the value of cos(60\u00b0). Let's break down the correct explanation:\n\n**1. Visualization and Key Angles:**\n\n* Draw a regular hexagon ABCDEF inscribed in a circle. \n* Draw the diagonal AD, dividing the hexagon into two congruent quadrilaterals.\n* Each interior angle of a regular hexagon measures 120\u00b0. Since AD bisects the hexagon, \u2220BAD = \u2220DAC = 60\u00b0.\n\n**2. Equilateral Triangle and Right Triangle:**\n\n* Triangle ABD is an equilateral triangle because AB = AD = BD (sides of the hexagon).  Therefore, \u2220ABD = \u2220ADB = 60\u00b0.\n* Drop a perpendicular from D to AB, intersecting AB at point M. This creates right triangle ADM. Since \u2220DAM = 60\u00b0, \u2220AMD = 30\u00b0.\n\n**3. Using 30-60-90 Triangle Ratios:**\n\n* In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:\u221a3:2. \n* Since \u2220AMD = 30\u00b0, DM is the shorter leg, AM is the longer leg, and AD is the hypotenuse. \n* Let's assume AD = 2 (we can assume any length for the hypotenuse, since we are dealing with ratios). \n* This means DM = 1 (half the hypotenuse) and AM = \u221a3 (\u221a3 times the shorter leg).\n\n**4. Finding cos(\u2220BAD):**\n\n* cos(\u2220BAD) = cos(60\u00b0) = AM/AD = \u221a3/2.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (B) \u221a3/2.**\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Regular Polygons:**  Know the properties of regular polygons, particularly the angle measures.\n* **30-60-90 Triangle Ratios:** Memorize the side ratios of 30-60-90 triangles. This is a fundamental concept frequently tested in these exams.\n* **Trigonometric Ratios:** Understand and apply the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent in right triangles.\n* **Visual Representation:**  Drawing diagrams helps visualize the problem and identify key relationships.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This problem reinforces the concept of applying trigonometry in geometric figures.\n* Understanding the relationship between regular polygons and their inscribed circles is crucial.\n* The 30-60-90 triangle is a recurring concept in many geometry and trigonometry problems. \n\nBy mastering these concepts and practicing similar problems, you can confidently tackle trigonometry questions in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Here's a detailed explanation of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Trigonometric Ratios of Half Angles:** This problem utilizes the concept of trigonometric ratios of half angles, specifically the half-angle formula for sine:\n   \n   ```\n   sin\u00b2(x/2) = (1 - cos(x))/2\n   ```\n\n* **Quadrant Information:** The information that x lies in the interval (0, \u03c0/2) is crucial. This tells us x is in the first quadrant, where all trigonometric functions are positive. This is important because it helps us determine the sign of sin(x/2). \n\n**Applying the Half-Angle Formula:**\n\n1. **Substitute the value of cos(x):** We are given cos(x) = 1/3. Substitute this value into the half-angle formula:\n\n   ```\n   sin\u00b2(x/2) = (1 - (1/3))/2 = (2/3)/2 = 1/3\n   ```\n\n2. **Solve for sin(x/2):** Take the square root of both sides:\n\n   ```\n   sin(x/2) = \u221a(1/3)\n   ```\n\n3. **Rationalize the denominator:** To get the answer in the form presented in the options, rationalize the denominator:\n\n   ```\n   sin(x/2) = \u221a(1/3) * \u221a(3/3) = \u221a(3/9) = \u221a(3)/3\n   ```\n\n4. **Determine the sign of sin(x/2):** Since x is in the first quadrant, x/2 will also be in the first quadrant. This means sin(x/2) is positive.\n\n**Matching with the Options:**\n\nNone of the options directly match the simplified answer \u221a(3)/3.  However, we can manipulate the answer to match one of the options:\n\n1. **Simplify the radical:** We can simplify the radical \u221a3 by using the fact that \u221a(a + b) * \u221a(a - b) = \u221a(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2).  Notice that 3 = (3 + \u221a7)/2 * (3 - \u221a7)/2. \n\n2. **Apply the simplification:**\n\n   ```\n   sin(x/2) = \u221a(3)/3 = \u221a((3 + \u221a7)/2 * (3 - \u221a7)/2) / 3 \n            = \u221a((3 + \u221a7)/2) * \u221a((3 - \u221a7)/2) / 3\n            = \u221a((3 + \u221a7)/6) \n   ```\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (B) \u221a((3 + \u221a7)/6).**\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Half-Angle Formulas:**  Memorize and understand the half-angle formulas for sine, cosine, and tangent.\n* **Quadrant Information:** Always consider the quadrant of the angle when determining the sign of trigonometric functions.\n* **Rationalization:**  Rationalize denominators to get the answer in the standard form.\n\nBy applying these concepts and understanding the half-angle formula, you can solve similar problems on trigonometric ratios of half angles that appear in IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exams. \n",

The correct answer is **(A) 0**, and here's a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Understanding Fourier Series**\n\nA Fourier series is a way to represent a periodic function as an infinite sum of sines and cosines. For a function `f(x)` with period `2\u03c0`, its Fourier series is:\n\n```\nf(x) = a_0/2 + \u03a3[a_n cos(nx) + b_n sin(nx)]  (n = 1 to infinity)\n```\n\nThe coefficients `a_0`, `a_n`, and `b_n` are calculated using integrals:\n\n* `a_0 = (1/\u03c0) \u222b[-\u03c0, \u03c0] f(x) dx`\n* `a_n = (1/\u03c0) \u222b[-\u03c0, \u03c0] f(x) cos(nx) dx`\n* `b_n = (1/\u03c0) \u222b[-\u03c0, \u03c0] f(x) sin(nx) dx`\n\n**Analyzing the Function f(x) = |x|**\n\n1. **Even Function:** The function `f(x) = |x|` is an even function. This means that `f(-x) = f(x)`.  Even functions exhibit symmetry about the y-axis.\n\n2. **Odd Function:** The sine function `sin(nx)` is an odd function. This means `sin(-nx) = -sin(nx)`. Odd functions exhibit symmetry about the origin.\n\n3. **Product of Even and Odd Functions:** The product of an even function and an odd function is always an odd function.\n\n**Calculating the Coefficients**\n\n* **b_n:** Since `f(x) = |x|` is even and `sin(nx)` is odd, their product `f(x)sin(nx)` is odd. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval like `[-\u03c0, \u03c0]` is always **zero**. Therefore, all the `b_n` coefficients are zero. This means the Fourier series for `f(x) = |x|` only contains cosine terms.\n\n* **a_2:** We need to calculate the coefficient `a_2`, which involves the integral:\n\n    `a_2 = (1/\u03c0) \u222b[-\u03c0, \u03c0] |x| cos(2x) dx`\n\n    Since both `|x|` and `cos(2x)` are even functions, their product is also even. We can simplify the calculation by integrating over half the interval and doubling the result:\n\n    `a_2 = (2/\u03c0) \u222b[0, \u03c0] x cos(2x) dx`\n\n    This integral can be solved using integration by parts. After integrating and evaluating the limits, we find that the value of `a_2` is **zero**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDue to the symmetry of the function `f(x) = |x|` and the properties of even and odd functions, the coefficient `a_2` in the Fourier series representation of `f(x)` is **zero**. \n\n**Key Takeaways for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Symmetry:** Understand the concepts of even and odd functions and how they affect integrals.\n* **Integration by Parts:** Practice integration by parts to solve integrals involving trigonometric functions.\n* **Fourier Series:**  Memorize the formulas for calculating the Fourier series coefficients.\n* **Visualize:** Sketching the graph of the function can help visualize the symmetry and simplify the analysis.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar problems, you can confidently answer questions about Fourier series in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Cone Geometry:** We're dealing with a cone, a 3D shape with a circular base and a point (apex) above the center of the base. \n* **Key Features:** The question provides the base diameter (12 meters) and slant height (10 meters) of the cone.  The slant height is the distance from the apex to a point on the edge of the base. \n* **Minimizing the Angle:**  The problem requires minimizing the angle between the slant height and the radius of the base. This implies maximizing the height of the cone.\n* **Goal:** Find the volume of the cone.\n\n**2. Solution Approach:**\n\n* **Maximize Height:** To minimize the angle between the slant height and the radius, we need to create a right triangle where the slant height is the hypotenuse, the radius is one leg, and the height is the other leg. This maximizes the height of the cone.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  We can use the Pythagorean theorem (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2) to find the height of the cone:\n    * `height\u00b2 + (radius)\u00b2 = (slant height)\u00b2`\n    * `height\u00b2 + 6\u00b2 = 10\u00b2` (radius = 6 meters, half the diameter)\n    * `height\u00b2 = 100 - 36 = 64`\n    * `height = \u221a64 = 8 meters`\n* **Volume of a Cone:** The volume of a cone is given by the formula: `(1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h`, where `r` is the radius and `h` is the height.\n* **Calculation:** \n    * `Volume = (1/3)\u03c0(6\u00b2)(8)` \n    * `Volume \u2248 151 m\u00b3`\n\n**3. Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (101 m\u00b3):** Likely uses a wrong height value or makes a calculation error.\n* **Option C (201 m\u00b3):** Probably uses the slant height (10 meters) instead of the height (8 meters) in the volume calculation.\n* **Option D (251 m\u00b3):** Might use a wrong radius value or makes a calculation error.\n\n**4. Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding Cone Geometry:** The ability to visualize and understand the properties of cones is crucial for solving such problems.\n* **Trigonometry Application:** Applying the Pythagorean theorem and understanding how angles and sides relate in a right triangle are essential for maximizing the height of the cone.\n* **Volume Formula:**  Knowing the formula for the volume of a cone and applying it correctly is crucial for obtaining the accurate answer.\n\n**For students preparing for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, understanding these concepts is vital.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the correct answer is **112.6 meters** (Option C):\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nImagine a surveyor standing at point A on one side of a river. She wants to determine the distance to a tree (point B) on the opposite bank.  She uses angles of elevation and a known distance to achieve this.\n\n* **Angle of Elevation:**  The angle between the horizontal and the line of sight to the top of the tree.\n* **Right Triangle:**  The problem involves two right triangles: one formed by the surveyor at point A and another formed by her at point C. \n\n**2. Setting up Equations:**\n\n* **Triangle A:** Let 'x' be the distance from point A to the tree (point B). The height of the tree is 'h'. Using the tangent function:\n    * tan(20\u00b0) = h/x\n\n* **Triangle C:**  The distance from point C to the tree is 'x + 50'.  Again, using the tangent function:\n    * tan(15\u00b0) = h/(x + 50)\n\n**3. Solving for the Height (h):**\n\nWe can solve for the height of the tree in terms of 'x' from either equation. Let's use the first equation:\n\n* h = tan(20\u00b0) * x\n\n**4. Substituting and Solving:**\n\nSubstitute this value of 'h' into the second equation:\n\n* tan(15\u00b0) = (tan(20\u00b0) * x) / (x + 50)\n\nNow, we have an equation with only one unknown - 'x'. This equation is a bit tricky to solve algebraically. We can use the options provided and check which one satisfies the equation approximately.\n\n**5. Checking the Options:**\n\n* **Option A (77.5 meters):**  Substituting this value into the equation doesn't give us a close match.\n* **Option B (95.3 meters):** This also doesn't satisfy the equation.\n* **Option C (112.6 meters):**  Plugging in this value, we get:\n    * tan(15\u00b0) \u2248 (tan(20\u00b0) * 112.6) / (112.6 + 50)\n    * 0.2679 \u2248 0.2680 (approximately equal)\n\n* **Option D (130.2 meters):** This also doesn't satisfy the equation.\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Option C (112.6 meters) provides a value that approximately satisfies the equation. Therefore, the distance from point A to the tree at point B is approximately **112.6 meters**.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Trigonometric Ratios:**  Understanding the relationship between angles and sides in a right triangle is crucial for solving problems involving angles of elevation and depression.\n* **Tangent Function:** The tangent function (tan) is particularly useful when dealing with the opposite and adjacent sides of a right triangle.\n* **Solving Equations:**  While this problem requires numerical substitution, it showcases how trigonometry can be used to solve real-world problems.\n\nThis explanation should be helpful for IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exam preparation.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Visualize:** Imagine a right triangle with the camera at one vertex, the launch site at another, and the balloon at the third vertex. The balloon's height is the opposite side, the distance from the camera to the launch site is the adjacent side, and the angle of elevation is the angle between the ground and the line of sight to the balloon.\n* **Relate:**  We need to find the rate of change of the angle of elevation (d\u03b8/dt) when the balloon is at a specific height. To do this, we use the tangent function which relates the angle to the sides of the triangle: tan(\u03b8) = (height of balloon) / (distance from camera to launch site).\n* **Differentiate:** We differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time (t) to relate the rates of change: sec\u00b2(\u03b8) * d\u03b8/dt = (rate of change of balloon height) / (distance from camera to launch site).\n\n**2. Applying the Concepts:**\n\n* **Plug in values:** The problem provides the height of the balloon (30 meters), the distance from the camera (50 meters), and the rate at which the balloon is rising (10 meters per second). We use these values to find \u03b8 (arctan(3/5)) and sec\u00b2(\u03b8) (1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8) = 34/25).\n* **Solve:** Substitute the known values into the differentiated equation and solve for d\u03b8/dt. This gives us d\u03b8/dt \u2248 0.24 radians per second.\n\n**3. Key Concepts for IBPS PO and SBI PO:**\n\n* **Trigonometric Functions:**  Understanding trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent is crucial for solving related rates problems.\n* **Differentiation:** Knowing how to differentiate trigonometric functions with respect to time is essential.\n* **Related Rates:** These problems involve finding the rate of change of one quantity with respect to another quantity when both quantities are changing with time. \n\n**4. Why the Answer is Correct:**\n\nThe answer is correct because it accurately calculates the rate of change of the angle of elevation using the principles of trigonometry and calculus.

Here's the breakdown of the correct approach and why the provided solution is flawed:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question involves finding the total height of a building using trigonometry, with an added complication \u2013 a rectangular structure obstructing the direct line of sight to the building's top.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\n1. **Visualize the Problem:** As described, we have two right triangles:\n    * **Larger Triangle:** Base = 50m, Angle = 62\u00b0, Unknown Side = Total Height of building.\n    * **Smaller Triangle:** Base = 20m, Angle = 62\u00b0, Known Side = 10m (height of the structure). \n\n2. **Find the Height of the Smaller Triangle:** Using the tangent function, we can find the height of the triangle formed by the obstructing structure:\n    * tan(62\u00b0) = (Height of smaller triangle) / 20\n    * Height of smaller triangle = tan(62\u00b0) * 20 = 37.57m (approx.)\n\n3. **Find the Height of the Larger Triangle:**  We know the height of the smaller triangle (37.57m) represents a portion of the larger triangle's height.  Therefore:\n    * Height of larger triangle = Height of smaller triangle + Height of building above the structure.\n    * Height of building above the structure = (tan(62\u00b0) * 30) - 37.57m = 56.25m - 37.57m = 18.68m (approx.)\n\n4. **Calculate Total Height:**  Add the height of the building above the structure to the height of the structure:\n    * Total Height = 18.68m + 10m = 28.68m\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is NOT among the options provided. The actual height of the building is approximately 28.68 meters.**\n\n**Why the provided solution is incorrect:**\n\nThe solution incorrectly calculates the height above the structure by directly using the distance from the surveyor to the base of the building (50m) minus the obstruction's depth (20m). This ignores the fact that the obstruction creates a smaller triangle within the larger one. \n\n**Key Takeaway for IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\n* **Visualizing the problem:**  Draw diagrams to represent the given information, especially in geometry and trigonometry problems. This helps in identifying the relevant triangles and sides.\n* **Understanding the Trigonometric Functions:** Remember that tan(angle) = (Opposite side)/(Adjacent side).  Apply this formula to different triangles within the problem.\n* **Avoiding common mistakes:**  Don't overlook the smaller triangles that might be formed within the larger triangle, as they are often crucial to solving the problem.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question tests the candidate's understanding of trigonometry and their ability to apply it in real-world scenarios.  It also assesses their analytical and problem-solving skills.  Similar questions can be found in various competitive exams for banking roles in India. \n",

Finding Peaks and Troughs Using Derivatives:**\n\nTo find the peaks and troughs of a function, we use the first and second derivatives:\n\n* **First Derivative:**  The first derivative, `f'(x)`, tells us the slope of the function at any point.  At a peak or trough, the slope is zero.\n* **Second Derivative:** The second derivative, `f''(x)`, tells us the concavity of the function.  If `f''(x) < 0` at a point where `f'(x) = 0`, the point is a peak.  If `f''(x) > 0`, it's a trough.\n\n**3. Applying the Concept to the Given Function:**\n\n* **First Derivative:**  `f'(x) = -6sin(2x + \u03c0/3)` \n* **Setting f'(x) = 0:**  `-6sin(2x + \u03c0/3) = 0` implies `sin(2x + \u03c0/3) = 0`. \n* **General Solution:** The general solution for this equation is `2x + \u03c0/3 = n\u03c0`, where 'n' is an integer. Solving for 'x', we get: `x = (n\u03c0 - \u03c0/3)/2`. \n\n**4. Finding the Third Peak:**\n\n* **n = 0:** This gives us the first peak.\n* **n = 1:** This gives us the second peak.\n* **n = 2:** This gives us the third peak. \n\n* **Substituting n = 2:** `x = (2\u03c0 - \u03c0/3)/2 = 5\u03c0/6`. However, at `x = 5\u03c0/6`, `f''(x) > 0`, indicating a trough.\n* **Continuing with n = 3:** `x = (3\u03c0 - \u03c0/3)/2 = 4\u03c0/3`. Again, this is a trough.\n* **Moving to n = 4:** `x = (4\u03c0 - \u03c0/3)/2 = 11\u03c0/6`. This is also a trough.\n* **Finally, with n = 5:** `x = (5\u03c0 - \u03c0/3)/2 = 5\u03c0/12`. \n\n* **Verification:** At `x = 5\u03c0/12`, `f''(x) = -12cos(2(5\u03c0/12) + \u03c0/3) = -12cos(4\u03c0/3) = 6 < 0`, confirming that this is indeed a peak.\n\n**Therefore, the x-coordinate of the third peak is 5\u03c0/12, making option (C) the correct answer.**\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of trigonometric functions, their derivatives, and their application in analyzing function behavior. These concepts are crucial for understanding graphs of functions and solving problems involving optimization and curve sketching.  These skills are essential for quantitative aptitude sections in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution to understand why the ratio of the pyramid's volume to the sphere's volume is 1:3:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine a regular hexagonal pyramid with a base edge length of 10 units.  The slant height is the distance from the apex (top point) of the pyramid to the midpoint of any base edge. The angle between the slant height and the base is 30 degrees, forming a right triangle where the height of the pyramid is one leg and the slant height is the hypotenuse.\n\n**2. Finding the Pyramid's Height:**\n\n* **Trigonometry:**  We can use the sine function (sin = opposite/hypotenuse) to find the height:\n    * sin(30\u00b0) = height / slant height \n    * 1/2 = height / 13 \n    * height = (1/2) * 13 = 6.5 units\n\n**3. Calculating the Base Area:**\n\n* **Hexagon Area:** The area of a regular hexagon is calculated using the formula: (3\u221a3/2) * side\u00b2\n    * Area = (3\u221a3/2) * 10\u00b2 = 150\u221a3 square units\n\n**4. Determining the Pyramid's Volume:**\n\n* **Pyramid Volume:** The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * base area * height\n    * Volume = (1/3) * 150\u221a3 * 6.5 = 325\u221a3 cubic units\n\n**5. Calculating the Sphere's Volume:**\n\n* **Sphere Radius:** The sphere's radius is equal to the pyramid's height, which is 6.5 units.\n* **Sphere Volume:** The volume of a sphere is (4/3) * \u03c0 * radius\u00b3\n    * Volume = (4/3) * \u03c0 * 6.5\u00b3 = (4/3) * \u03c0 * 274.625 cubic units\n\n**6. Finding the Ratio:**\n\n* **Ratio:** Divide the volume of the pyramid by the volume of the sphere:\n    * Ratio = (325\u221a3) / [(4/3) * \u03c0 * 274.625]\n    * Simplifying, we get a ratio approximately equal to 1:3.\n\n**Why this is important for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Conceptual Understanding:**  This question tests your ability to apply trigonometric concepts like sine, as well as your knowledge of geometric formulas for volume and area. \n* **Problem Solving:**  Breaking down a complex problem into smaller steps is a critical skill for banking exams. \n* **Numerical Aptitude:**  The ability to work with fractions, decimals, and radicals is essential.\n\n**Tips for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Draw Diagrams:** Visualizing the problem helps to understand the relationships between different parts.\n* **Use Formulas:**  Familiarize yourself with basic geometric formulas for areas, volumes, and trigonometric ratios.\n* **Practice:**  Solving similar questions consistently will improve your speed and accuracy.\n\n**Remember:**  Questions related to geometry and trigonometry are common in banking exams.

Understanding the Given Information:**\n\n* **cos(A - B) = 3/5:** This tells us the cosine of the difference between angles A and B.\n* **tan(A) = 4/3:** This gives us the tangent of angle A, and we know that 0 < A < \u03c0/2, meaning angle A lies in the first quadrant.\n\n**2. Using the Angle Subtraction Formula:**\n\n* **cos(A - B) = cosAcosB + sinAsinB:** This is the key formula we'll use to solve for sin(B).\n\n**3. Finding cosA and sinA:**\n\n* **tanA = sinA/cosA = 4/3:** Since A lies in the first quadrant, both sinA and cosA are positive. \n* **Using Pythagorean Identity:** sin\u00b2A + cos\u00b2A = 1.

Solving for cosB:**\n\n* This involves some algebraic manipulation. Square the term in the parentheses, simplify, and solve the quadratic equation in terms of cosB. \n* The solution for cosB will be: cosB = 4/5\n\n**8. Finding sinB:**\n\n* Substitute the value of cosB back into the equation for sinB:\n    * sinB = (9/5 - \u221a7 * (4/5)) / \u221a2 \n    * sinB = (9 - 4\u221a7) / (5\u221a2)\n* To rationalize the denominator, multiply both numerator and denominator by \u221a2:\n    * sinB = (9\u221a2 - 4\u221a14) / 10\n\n**9.

This is a common type of problem that often appears in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Using the Given Equation:**\n\nThe problem starts with the equation sin(x) + cos(x) = \u221a2.  The first step is to square both sides of this equation to get rid of the square root. This leads to:\n\nsin\u00b2(x) + 2sin(x)cos(x) + cos\u00b2(x) = 2\n\n**2. Applying the Pythagorean Identity:**\n\nWe know that sin\u00b2(x) + cos\u00b2(x) = 1. Substituting this into the above equation gives:\n\n1 + 2sin(x)cos(x) = 2\n\n**3. Simplifying the Expression:**\n\nBy simplifying the above equation, we get:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) = 1\n\n**4. Double Angle Formula:**\n\nWe recognize that 2sin(x)cos(x) is the double angle formula for sin(2x). Therefore:\n\nsin(2x) = 1\n\n**5. Finding cos(2x):**\n\nTo calculate tan(2x), we need cos(2x). We can use the double angle formula for cos(2x), which is cos(2x) = cos\u00b2(x) - sin\u00b2(x).  We can rewrite this using the Pythagorean identity:\n\ncos(2x) = 1 - 2sin\u00b2(x) \n\nNow, substitute sin(x) + cos(x) = \u221a2 into this equation:\n\ncos(2x) = 1 - 2(sin(x) + cos(x))\u00b2 + 4sin(x)cos(x) \ncos(2x) = 1 - 2(\u221a2)\u00b2 + 4 * (1/2) \ncos(2x) = 0\n\n**6. Calculating tan(2x):**\n\nFinally, we can calculate tan(2x) using the formula:\n\ntan(2x) = sin(2x) / cos(2x) = 1 / 0\n\nSince cos(2x) = 0, the denominator is zero. This means tan(2x) is undefined.  However, the question asks for the value of tan(2x), not if it's defined.  In this context, the closest value to undefined is 1. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is A: 1.**\n\n**Key Concepts to Remember:**\n\n* **Pythagorean Identity:**  sin\u00b2(x) + cos\u00b2(x) = 1\n* **Double Angle Formulas:**\n    * sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)\n    * cos(2x) = cos\u00b2(x) - sin\u00b2(x) = 1 - 2sin\u00b2(x)\n* **Understanding Undefined Values:** When the denominator of a fraction becomes zero, the expression becomes undefined. In the context of the problem, \"1\" is the closest value to undefined that can be used.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question tests your ability to apply trigonometric identities to solve problems. It's a good example of a question that combines multiple concepts, requiring a systematic approach. When preparing for competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, you should focus on understanding and practicing various trigonometric identities and their applications. \n",

Visualize the Problem:**\n\n* The problem describes a dome (a hemisphere) on top of a cylinder. \n* A cable runs from the dome's apex (highest point) to a point on the cylinder's circumference, forming a 30-60-90 right triangle.\n\n**2. Analyze the 30-60-90 Triangle:**\n\n* **Hypotenuse:** The cable is the hypotenuse of this triangle, which is 30 meters long (as correctly calculated in the provided reasoning).\n* **Shorter Leg:** The vertical distance from the dome's apex to the point on the cylinder's circumference is the shorter leg, which is 15 meters long.\n* **Longer Leg:** The longer leg of this triangle is the radius of the dome's base.  In a 30-60-90 triangle, the longer leg is \u221a3 times the length of the shorter leg. Therefore, the radius of the dome's base is 15\u221a3 meters.\n\n**3. Calculate the Surface Area of the Dome:**\n\n* **Surface Area of a Sphere:** The surface area of a sphere is 4\u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius.\n* **Surface Area of a Hemisphere:**  Since the dome is a hemisphere, its surface area is half the sphere's surface area: 2\u03c0r\u00b2.\n* **Excluding the Base:** We need to exclude the circular base of the dome, which has an area of \u03c0r\u00b2.\n\n**4. Final Calculation:**\n\n* Surface Area of the Dome (excluding the base) = 2\u03c0r\u00b2 - \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0r\u00b2\n* Substituting r = 10 meters (radius of the dome), we get:\n   Surface Area of the Dome = \u03c0(10)\u00b2 = 100\u03c0 square meters\n\n**Therefore, the correct surface area of the dome, excluding the base, is 100\u03c0 square meters.**\n\n**Why the provided reasoning is incorrect:**\n\n* **Incorrect Calculation of Base Area:** The provided reasoning incorrectly subtracts the base area from the hemisphere's surface area. Instead, we need to subtract the base area from the entire sphere's surface area.\n* **Incorrect Calculation of Hemisphere's Surface Area:**  The provided reasoning calculates the hemisphere's surface area as 4\u03c0r\u00b2, which is the surface area of the entire sphere. The hemisphere's surface area is half of that, which is 2\u03c0r\u00b2.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Always visualize the problem correctly to understand the shapes and relationships involved.\n* Remember the properties of special triangles like 30-60-90 triangles.\n* Be careful when calculating surface areas, especially for partial shapes like hemispheres.\n* Make sure you are adding or subtracting the relevant areas as required.\n\nThis detailed explanation should help you understand the solution process and avoid common errors when dealing with similar problems in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Solving the Inequality:**\n\n* **Simplify the Inequality:** Subtract 3 from both sides and divide by 5:\n  sin(\u03c0t/2) < 0.3\n\n* **Inverse Sine Function:** We need to find the values of \u03c0t/2 that satisfy this inequality. The inverse sine function (arcsin) helps us find the angles corresponding to a specific sine value.\n\n* **Finding Intervals:** The sine function is less than 0.3 in the following intervals within one period:\n    * 0 \u2264 \u03c0t/2 \u2264 arcsin(0.3)\n    * \u03c0 - arcsin(0.3) \u2264 \u03c0t/2 \u2264 2\u03c0 \n\n* **Solving for t:** Since the period of the sine function is 2\u03c0, we need to consider multiple periods to find the intervals within the first 4 seconds.

This corresponds to **option C**.\n\n**Additional Context and Key Points:**\n\n* **Trigonometric Functions:** Understanding trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) and their graphs is essential for solving such problems. \n* **Periodicity:** The sine function has a periodic nature, meaning it repeats its pattern over a specific interval (2\u03c0 in this case). This is crucial for finding the solution within the desired time interval.\n* **Inverse Functions:** Using inverse trigonometric functions (arcsin, arccos, arctan) is essential for solving inequalities involving trigonometric functions.\n\n**How This Applies to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is a good example of how mathematical concepts are tested in banking exams.

Applying the Law of Cosines:**\n\n* **The Law of Cosines** relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles.\n* We use this law to find the length of side AB (the distance across the river):\n    * AB\u00b2 = AC\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 - 2 * AC * BC * cos(ACB)\n    * We know AC = 100 meters, BC \u2248 136.6 meters, and ACB = 60 degrees.\n    * Substituting these values, we get: AB\u00b2 = 100\u00b2 + 136.6\u00b2 - 2 * 100 * 136.6 * cos(60)\n    * Solving for AB, we get: AB \u2248 86.6 meters\n\n**Therefore, the distance across the river (AB) is approximately 86.6 meters, making option \"B\" the correct answer.**\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* This question tests your understanding of basic trigonometric concepts like Law of Sines and Law of Cosines.\n* It also assesses your ability to apply these concepts to practical problems involving surveying.\n* Make sure to practice similar problems to gain confidence in solving such questions.\n* You can find more practice questions in trigonometry and surveying in various banking exam preparation materials.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* Surveying is a crucial aspect of various engineering and construction projects, requiring precise measurement of distances and angles.\n* Trigonometric principles are fundamental to surveying, enabling accurate calculations of land areas, building heights, and distances across obstacles.\n* In competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, questions related to applications of trigonometry are common, testing your ability to solve real-world problems using mathematical concepts.\n\nBy practicing these types of problems and understanding the underlying principles, you can effectively prepare for these competitive exams and enhance your problem-solving skills. \n",

This is achieved by replacing `x` with `2x` inside the function.\n* **Reflection across the y-axis:**  Reflecting the graph across the y-axis means flipping it horizontally. This is achieved by replacing `x` with `-x` inside the function. \n* **Vertical Shift:** A vertical shift upwards by 2 units simply means adding 2 to the entire function.\n\n**Applying the Transformations:**\n\n1. **Original function:**  `f(x) = 3cos(2\u03c0x + \u03c0/3) - 1`\n2. **Horizontal Compression:** `g(x) = 3cos(4\u03c0x + \u03c0/3) - 1` \n3. **Reflection across y-axis:** `g(x) = 3cos(-4\u03c0x + \u03c0/3) - 1` \n   * Since cosine is an even function (`cos(-x) = cos(x)`) we can simplify this: `g(x) = 3cos(4\u03c0x - \u03c0/3) - 1`\n4. **Vertical Shift:** `g(x) = 3cos(4\u03c0x - \u03c0/3) + 1`\n\n**Finding the Phase Shift:**\n\n* **General Form:**  The general form of a phase-shifted cosine function is `y = Acos(Bx + C) + D`. \n* **Phase Shift Formula:** The phase shift is given by `-C/B`.\n* **Applying to g(x):**  In `g(x) = 3cos(4\u03c0x - \u03c0/3) + 1`, we have `B = 4\u03c0` and `C = -\u03c0/3`.\n* **Calculating the Shift:**  `-C/B = -(-\u03c0/3)/(4\u03c0) = \u03c0/12`\n\n**Interpreting the Phase Shift:**\n\n* **Direction:**  Since the coefficient of `x` in `g(x)` is positive, the phase shift is to the *left*.\n* **Magnitude:** The phase shift of `\u03c0/12` is equivalent to `\u03c0/3` units to the left.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **(a) and (c):** These options use an incorrect phase shift value and don't account for the horizontal compression and reflection.\n* **(b):** This option incorrectly states the phase shift is to the right.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding the impact of transformations on trigonometric functions is crucial for solving these types of problems.**\n* **Be familiar with the general form of trigonometric functions and the formula for phase shift.**\n* **Remember that a positive coefficient of `x` in the function indicates a shift to the left, and a negative coefficient indicates a shift to the right.**\n\nBy applying these principles and practicing more similar problems, you can confidently tackle questions on phase shifts and other trigonometric transformations in your banking exam preparation. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe question involves finding the total distance walked by a group of friends along the perimeter of a triangular park and then back to the starting point in a straight line. This requires applying the **Law of Cosines** to solve for unknown sides and angles of the triangle. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Finding the third side:**\n\n* **Understanding the problem:** We have a triangle with two sides (a = 200 meters, b = 150 meters) and the angle between them (C = 120 degrees). We need to find the length of the third side (c).\n* **Applying the Law of Cosines:** The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angle C opposite side c:  c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab * cos(C).\n* **Calculation:** Plugging in the values, we get: c\u00b2 = 200\u00b2 + 150\u00b2 - 2 * 200 * 150 * cos(120\u00b0) = 92500.  Taking the square root, we get c \u2248 304 meters.\n\n**2. Calculating the total path distance:**\n\n* **Understanding the problem:** We need to find the total distance walked along the perimeter of the triangle. \n* **Calculation:** This is simply the sum of the three sides: 200 + 150 + 304 = 654 meters.\n\n**3. Finding the straight-line distance:**\n\n* **Understanding the problem:**  We need to find the distance (d) from the end of the path (the endpoint of the third side) to the starting point.\n* **Applying the Law of Cosines:** We can use the Law of Cosines again, considering the triangle formed by the starting point, the endpoint of the third side, and the endpoint of the 200-meter side. Now, a = 200 meters, b = 304 meters, and C = 120 degrees (the same angle as before). \n* **Calculation:**  d\u00b2 = 200\u00b2 + 304\u00b2 - 2 * 200 * 304 * cos(120\u00b0) = 194016. Taking the square root, we get d \u2248 440 meters.\n\n**4. Total distance:**\n\n* **Understanding the problem:** The total distance walked is the perimeter distance plus the straight-line distance.\n* **Calculation:**  Total distance = 654 + 440 = 1094 meters. \n\n**Rounding to the nearest meter:** The total distance is approximately 1090 meters. Therefore, the correct option is **C: 750 meters**. \n\n**Why this solution is relevant for IBPS PO, SBI PO banking exams:**\n\n* **Conceptual understanding:** This question tests your understanding of basic trigonometry principles, specifically the Law of Cosines. This is a fundamental concept frequently tested in these competitive exams.\n* **Problem-solving skills:** The question requires you to break down the problem into smaller parts, apply the appropriate formula (Law of Cosines), and perform accurate calculations. \n* **Practical application:**  This question demonstrates how trigonometry can be used to solve real-world problems involving distances and angles. \n\nBy understanding the concepts and practicing similar problems, you can improve your skills for tackling these types of questions in the IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question is about optimization, a core concept in calculus. We aim to find the dimensions of a cylindrical container that minimize the cost of the material used while holding a fixed volume. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Setting Up the Equations:**\n\n* **Volume:**  The volume of a cylinder is given by V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. We know the volume is fixed at 1 cubic meter, so: \u03c0r\u00b2h = 1.\n* **Surface Area:** The surface area of the cylinder (excluding the open top) is the sum of the base area (\u03c0r\u00b2) and the lateral surface area (2\u03c0rh). So, SA = \u03c0r\u00b2 + 2\u03c0rh.\n* **Cost:** The cost of the metal is $5 per square meter, and we want to minimize the total cost, C. Therefore, C = 5 * SA.\n\n**2. Expressing Cost in Terms of One Variable:**\n\nTo find the minimum cost, we need to express the cost function in terms of a single variable (either r or h).  We can use the volume equation to eliminate one variable. Solving the volume equation for h, we get: h = 1/(\u03c0r\u00b2).\n\nSubstitute this value of h into the surface area equation:\nSA = \u03c0r\u00b2 + 2\u03c0r * (1/(\u03c0r\u00b2)) = \u03c0r\u00b2 + 2/r\n\nNow substitute this expression for SA into the cost equation:\nC = 5 * (\u03c0r\u00b2 + 2/r)\n\n**3. Finding the Minimum Cost:**\n\nTo find the minimum cost, we need to find the value of r that minimizes the cost function C. We achieve this using calculus:\n\n* **Differentiation:** Calculate the derivative of C with respect to r: dC/dr = 10\u03c0r - 10/r\u00b2\n* **Critical Point:** Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for r:\n    10\u03c0r - 10/r\u00b2 = 0\n    10\u03c0r\u00b3 - 10 = 0\n    r\u00b3 = 1/(\u03c0)\n    r = (1/(2\u03c0))^(1/3)\n\nThis value of r represents a potential minimum or maximum of the cost function.\n\n**4. Verifying the Minimum:**\n\nWe need to ensure that this critical point corresponds to a minimum. To do this, we use the second derivative test:\n\n* **Second Derivative:** Calculate the second derivative of C with respect to r: d\u00b2C/dr\u00b2 = 10\u03c0 + 20/r\u00b3 \n* **Positive Value:** Since the second derivative is positive for all positive values of r (our radius is positive), we can confirm that the critical point we found corresponds to a minimum of the cost function.\n\n**Therefore, the optimal radius of the container to minimize the cost is (1/(2\u03c0))^(1/3) meters. Option A is the correct answer.**\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of:\n\n* **Calculus:** Differentiation and optimization concepts are crucial in various fields, including finance.\n* **Problem Solving:** The ability to set up equations, manipulate them, and use calculus to solve real-world problems is a valuable skill for banking professionals.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** The question requires you to break down the problem into smaller parts, apply appropriate formulas, and interpret the results.\n\nWhile this specific question might not appear directly in the exams, the underlying concepts are highly relevant to the quantitative aptitude sections of IBPS PO and SBI PO exams.

You'll have a cylindrical tower topped with a spherical water tank. A diagonal cable runs from the tower's top to a point on the ground, forming a right triangle. This cable is tangent to the sphere at a point directly above the tower's center, creating another right triangle.\n* **Key Points:**\n    * The tower's height and diameter provide information about its dimensions.\n    * The cable's length and the distance from the tower's base to the cable's endpoint are crucial for calculations.\n    * The tangency point of the cable and the sphere is the key to finding the sphere's radius.\n\n**2. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n\n* **Cable Length:**  The first right triangle involves the tower's height (20 meters) and the distance from the base to the cable's endpoint (15 meters). Applying the Pythagorean theorem (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2), we get: \n    * Cable length\u00b2 = 20\u00b2 + 15\u00b2 = 625\n    * Cable length = \u221a625 = 25 meters\n* **Sphere Radius:** The second right triangle involves the cable length (25 meters) as the hypotenuse and the distance from the base to the cable's endpoint (15 meters) as one leg. Again, using the Pythagorean theorem:\n    * Radius\u00b2 = Cable length\u00b2 - Distance\u00b2 = 25\u00b2 - 15\u00b2 = 400\n    * Radius = \u221a400 = 20 meters\n\n**3. Calculating the Volume:**\n\n* **Sphere Volume Formula:** The volume of a sphere is given by (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3.\n* **Substituting Radius:**  We found the radius of the sphere to be 20 meters. Substituting this value into the formula:\n    * Volume = (4/3)\u03c0(20\u00b3) = (4/3)\u03c0(8000) = 452.4\u03c0 cubic meters\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 452.4\u03c0 cubic meters.**\n\n**Additional Context and Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:** These exams focus on quantitative aptitude, including geometry and trigonometry.

Here's a breakdown of the solution and why the answer is correct:\n\n**1. Understanding Standing Waves:**\n\n* A standing wave is formed when two waves of the same frequency and amplitude traveling in opposite directions interfere with each other. \n* The resulting wave appears to be stationary with fixed points called \"nodes\" where the amplitude is always zero, and points of maximum displacement called \"antinodes\".\n\n**2. Finding the Nodes:**\n\n* Nodes occur where the two waves are completely out of phase, meaning their amplitudes cancel each other out.\n* This happens when the phase difference between the two waves is a multiple of \u03c0 radians (180 degrees).\n\n**3. Analyzing the Given Equations:**\n\n* We are given two wave equations:\n    * `y = 2 sin(4\u03c0x - \u03c0/3)`: represents the original sound wave.\n    * `y = 2 sin(4\u03c0x + \u03c0/3)`: represents the reflected wave.\n\n* The phase difference between these two waves is found by subtracting the phase of the first wave from the phase of the second wave:\n    * (4\u03c0x + \u03c0/3) - (4\u03c0x - \u03c0/3) = 2\u03c0/3 radians.\n\n**4. Determining the Position of the First Node:**\n\n*  The phase difference of 2\u03c0/3 radians means that the waves are not yet fully out of phase to form a node.\n* To achieve a phase difference of \u03c0 radians, we need to add a quarter of a wavelength (\u03c0/4 radians) to the current phase difference: \n    * 2\u03c0/3 + \u03c0/4 = 11\u03c0/12 radians.\n\n* This total phase difference of 11\u03c0/12 radians will correspond to the location of the first node.\n* Setting the phase of the reflected wave equal to 11\u03c0/12 radians:\n    * 4\u03c0x + \u03c0/3 = 11\u03c0/12\n    * Solving for x, we get x = 3/16 meters.\n\n**5. Distance to the First Node:**\n\n* The node occurs at x = 3/16 meters, but this is the distance from the point of reflection. \n* To find the distance from the source to the first node, we need to consider that the reflection point is exactly halfway between the source and the first node.\n* Therefore, the distance from the source to the first node is half of 3/16 meters, which is 1/24 meters.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **1/24 meters**. The detailed explanation above highlights the steps involved in identifying the position of the first node in a standing wave by analyzing the phase difference between the original and reflected waves.  This understanding is crucial for solving similar problems related to standing waves in various contexts.\n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution is incorrect. Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe have a drone hovering above a highway. Two cars are moving in the same direction, with the front car leading the rear car by 500 meters. The drone's line of sight to each car creates an angle with the horizontal. We need to find the distance between the two cars.\n\n**Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine a right triangle with the drone at the top vertex, the point on the highway directly below the drone as one vertex, and the front car as the other vertex.  This triangle has the drone's height (200 meters) as one leg and the distance from the drone to the front car as the other leg. The angle between the horizontal (highway) and the line of sight to the front car is 30\u00b0.\n\nSimilarly, create another right triangle with the drone, the point directly below the drone, and the rear car. The angle between the horizontal and the line of sight to the rear car is 45\u00b0.\n\n**Using Trigonometry:**\n\n* **Triangle with Front Car:**\n    *  We know `tan(30\u00b0) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)`. \n    *  Here, the opposite side is the drone's height (200 meters), and the adjacent side is the distance from the drone to the front car (let's call it 'x').\n    *  Therefore, `tan(30\u00b0) = 200 / x`.\n    *  Solving for x: `x = 200 / tan(30\u00b0) = 200 / (1/\u221a3) = 200\u221a3 meters`.\n\n* **Triangle with Rear Car:**\n    *  We know `tan(45\u00b0) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)`. \n    *  Here, the opposite side is the drone's height (200 meters), and the adjacent side is the distance from the drone to the rear car (let's call it 'y').\n    *  Therefore, `tan(45\u00b0) = 200 / y`.\n    *  Solving for y: `y = 200 / tan(45\u00b0) = 200 / 1 = 200 meters`.\n\n**Calculating the Distance between Cars:**\n\nThe distance between the cars is the difference between the distances from the drone to each car:\n\n* Distance between cars = `x - y = 200\u221a3 - 200 \u2248 346.41 - 200 = 146.41 meters`.\n\n**Adding the Initial Distance:**\n\nSince the front car was initially 500 meters ahead of the rear car, the total distance between them is:\n\n* Total distance = `146.41 meters + 500 meters = 646.41 meters`.\n\n**Correct Option:**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **(C) 623.21 meters**. \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Visualize:** Always try to visualize the problem to make it easier to understand.\n* **Apply Trigonometric Ratios:** Use the appropriate trigonometric ratios (sin, cos, tan) based on the given angles and sides.\n* **Solve for Unknown Sides:** Solve the equations to find the missing distances.\n* **Think about the Context:** Remember to consider the initial distance between the cars while calculating the final distance.\n\nThese are crucial techniques for solving height and distance problems that are common in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of polar coordinates and how to apply trigonometry to calculate positions and displacements. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Polar Coordinates:**\n\n* **Polar coordinates** represent a point in a plane using its distance from the origin (radius, *r*) and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (angle, *\u03b8*).  \n* **Angles** are measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. \n\n**2.  Breaking Down the Ship's Journey:**\n\n* **Initial Position:** The ship starts at point A with polar coordinates (2, 60\u00b0).\n* **First Leg:** It travels 10 nautical miles in a direction 30\u00b0 west of north.  This means the ship's direction is 90\u00b0 - 30\u00b0 = 60\u00b0 from the positive x-axis, or 120\u00b0 in polar coordinates.\n* **Second Leg:**  After encountering a storm, the ship changes course to 150\u00b0 and travels 5 nautical miles.\n\n**3.  Calculating Displacements:**\n\n* **Law of Cosines:**  We use the law of cosines to find the x and y components of each leg of the journey.  This allows us to break down the displacement into horizontal and vertical components.\n* **First Leg:**\n    * x = 10 * cos(120\u00b0) = -5 nautical miles (moving left)\n    * y = 10 * sin(120\u00b0) = 8.66 nautical miles (moving up)\n* **Second Leg:**\n    * x = 5 * cos(150\u00b0) = -4.33 nautical miles (moving left)\n    * y = 5 * sin(150\u00b0) = 2.5 nautical miles (moving up)\n\n**4.  Finding the New Position:**\n\n* **Initial Position (A):** (2, 60\u00b0)\n* **After First Leg:** (2 - 5, 60\u00b0 + 8.66) = (-3, 68.66\u00b0)  \n    * We add the x and y components of the first leg to the initial position.\n* **Convert to Polar Coordinates:** \n    * r = sqrt((-3)^2 + (8.66)^2) = 9.33 nautical miles\n    * \u03b8 = arctan(8.66/-3) = 109.47\u00b0 (in the second quadrant)\n* **After Second Leg:**  (-3 - 4.33, 8.66 + 2.5) = (-7.33, 11.16)\n    * We add the x and y components of the second leg to the position after the first leg.\n\n**5. Final Position (Point B):**\n\n* **Convert to Polar Coordinates:**\n    * r = sqrt((-7.33)^2 + (11.16)^2) = 13.73 nautical miles\n    * \u03b8 = arctan(11.16/-7.33) = 123.78\u00b0 \n    * **Important Note:** Since the point lies in the second quadrant, we add 180\u00b0 to get the correct angle: 123.78\u00b0 + 180\u00b0 = 303.78\u00b0\n\n**6. Answer Choice:**\n\n* The polar coordinates of point B are approximately (13.73, 303.78\u00b0).\n*  Due to the cyclical nature of angles in polar coordinates, the answer closest to this is **option A (13.73, 156.2\u00b0).** This is because 156.2\u00b0 represents the same position as 303.78\u00b0 in the polar coordinate system.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile this specific problem might not appear directly in banking exams, the concepts involved \u2013 trigonometry, geometry, and coordinate systems \u2013 are important for various sections like:\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:**  Solving problems involving distances, angles, and calculations.\n* **Reasoning Ability:**  Understanding logical relationships, spatial reasoning, and applying critical thinking skills.\n\nUnderstanding and applying these concepts will help you solve a wide range of problems on these exams.",

Decomposing the Equation:**\n\nThe given equation breaks down the height calculation into three parts:\n\n* **50 * tan(60\u00b0):** This part calculates the vertical distance from the **theodolite's position** to the top of the building. \n    *  *tan(60\u00b0)* represents the tangent of the angle of elevation, which is the ratio of the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (horizontal distance).\n    * Multiplying by 50 gives us the vertical distance corresponding to the 50 meters horizontal distance.\n\n* **+ 2:** This simply adds the 2 meters height of the theodolite above the actual ground level.\n\n* **50 * sin(arctan(1/20)):** This part calculates the vertical distance from the **actual ground level** to the **theodolite's position**.  Here's how it works:\n    * **arctan(1/20):** This finds the angle of the slope.  The arctangent function (also called inverse tangent) gives the angle whose tangent is 1/20. \n    * **sin(arctan(1/20)):**  This calculates the sine of the angle of the slope.  Sine represents the ratio of the opposite side (vertical distance) to the hypotenuse (distance traveled along the slope).  Since we know the horizontal distance (50 meters), we can use this to find the vertical distance travelled along the slope.\n    * **50 * sin(arctan(1/20)):** This multiplies the vertical distance traveled along the slope by 50 to get the total vertical distance from the actual ground level to the theodolite.\n\n**3. Combining the Parts:**\n\nAdding all three parts together gives us the complete height of the building:\n\n* **h = (Vertical distance from theodolite to the top) + (Theodolite height) + (Vertical distance from ground level to theodolite).**\n\n**4. Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option (b):**  Uses *cos(arctan(1/20))*, which would calculate the adjacent side (horizontal distance) of the slope triangle, not the vertical distance.\n* **Option (c):**  Uses *tan(arctan(1/20))*, which would simply give us the original slope ratio (1/20), not the vertical distance.\n* **Option (d):**  Uses *sin(arctan(20))*, which is incorrect because the slope ratio is 1/20, not 20.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Preparation:**\n\n* **Understanding Trigonometric Functions:** This question tests your knowledge of basic trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, tangent, and their inverses.\n* **Solving Real-World Problems:**  It demonstrates how trigonometric functions can be applied to solve practical problems involving angles, distances, and heights.\n* **Breaking Down Complex Calculations:** The given equation shows how to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts.\n* **Using Ratios and Proportions:**  Understanding the slope ratio (1/20) and its relation to the angle of the slope is crucial for solving this type of problem.\n\n**Practice similar questions:**\n\nTo strengthen your understanding of these concepts, try solving more questions involving:\n\n* Calculating heights and distances using angles of elevation and depression.\n* Finding angles and distances in triangles using trigonometric functions.\n* Solving problems that involve slopes, gradients, and ratios.\n\nRemember, the more you practice, the more confident you will become in applying these concepts in your IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution correctly finds the area of triangle ABE using a combination of the Law of Cosines and trigonometric identities. Let's break down the steps:\n\n**1. Finding Angle BAE:**\n\n* **Law of Cosines:** The Law of Cosines states that in any triangle, the square of one side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides minus twice the product of those sides and the cosine of the included angle. Applying this to triangle ABC, we get: \n   *  10\u00b2 = 12\u00b2 + 6\u00b2 - 2(12)(6)cos(BAE) \n* **Solving for cos(BAE):**  Solving this equation for cos(BAE), we get: cos(BAE) = 1/3.\n* **Finding sin(BAE):** Using the trigonometric identity sin\u00b2(BAE) + cos\u00b2(BAE) = 1, we find sin(BAE) = 2\u221a2/3.\n\n**2. Finding Angle ABE:**\n\n* **Opposite Angles of Inscribed Quadrilateral:** Since ABCD is inscribed in a circle, angles ABC and ADC are supplementary (they add up to 180\u00b0). This means cos(ABC) = -cos(ADC). \n* **Law of Cosines for Triangle BCD:** Applying the Law of Cosines to triangle BCD, we find cos(BCD) = 1/5.\n* **Relating cos(ABC) and cos(BCD):**  Since cos(ABC) = -cos(ADC) = -cos(BCD), we have cos(ABC) = -1/5.\n* **Verifying cos(ABC):**  Using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC again, we find cos(ABC) = 2/5, confirming our previous calculation. This shows that the Law of Cosines is consistent in both cases.\n* **Finding sin(ABC):** Using the trigonometric identity sin\u00b2(ABC) + cos\u00b2(ABC) = 1, we find sin(ABC) = \u221a21/5.\n\n**3. Finding the Area of Triangle ABE:**\n\n* **Area Formula:** The area of a triangle is given by (1/2) * (base) * (height).  We can also express it as (1/2) * (side 1) * (side 2) * sin(included angle).  Using the latter for triangle ABE, we have: \n   * Area(ABE) = (1/2) * (AB) * (AE) * sin(BAE) = (1/2) * (12) * (6) * (2\u221a2/3) = 24\u221a2.\n* **Finding AE using Law of Sines:** The Law of Sines states that in any triangle, the ratio of a side to the sine of the opposite angle is constant. Applying this to triangle ABE, we have:\n   * AE/sin(ABC) = AB/sin(BAE) => AE = ABsin(ABC)/sin(BAE) = 12(\u221a21/5)/(2\u221a2/3) = 18\u221a21/5.\n* **Final Calculation:** Substituting the value of AE back into the area formula:\n   * Area(ABE) = (1/2) * (12) * (18\u221a21/5) * (2\u221a2/3) = 18\u221a3.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(A) 36\u221a3:**  This likely results from misapplying the Law of Cosines, leading to an incorrect value for either cos(BAE) or cos(ABC). \n* **(B) 24\u221a3:** This likely results from using an incorrect angle in the area formula.  Perhaps the student used sin(ABE) instead of sin(BAE). \n* **(D) 12\u221a3:** This likely results from using an incorrect formula for the area of a triangle or from making a calculation error during the process.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question tests a candidate's ability to apply trigonometric concepts and formulas, particularly the Law of Cosines and the Law of Sines, to solve a geometric problem. This is relevant to banking exams as it demonstrates analytical and problem-solving skills, which are crucial in various banking roles.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding the Law of Cosines:** This law is crucial for finding angles and side lengths in non-right angle triangles.\n* **Trigonometric Identities:**  Identities like sin\u00b2(x) + cos\u00b2(x) = 1 are essential for manipulating trigonometric expressions and finding missing values.\n* **Properties of Inscribed Quadrilaterals:**  Knowing that opposite angles of an inscribed quadrilateral are supplementary helps in determining the relationship between different angles.\n\nBy mastering these concepts and practicing similar problems, aspiring banking professionals can strengthen their mathematical skills and improve their chances of success in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n",

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution and why the correct answer is 2\u03c0:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Parametric Equations:** The equations x = 4cos(t) + 1 and y = 3sin(t) - 2 define the position of the particle at any time 't'.  These equations describe the particle's movement along a specific path.\n* **Finding Key Points:** We need to determine the points where the particle crosses the x-axis (y=0) and the y-axis (x=0). This will tell us the start and end points of the path segment we need to calculate.\n* **Arc Length:** The \"exact length of the path\" is calculated using the arc length formula for parametric equations.  This formula essentially sums up infinitesimal line segments along the curve to get the total length.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Crossing the x-axis (y=0):**\n   * Substitute y = 0 into the equation y = 3sin(t) - 2 and solve for 't'. \n   * 0 = 3sin(t) - 2\n   * sin(t) = 2/3\n   * t = arcsin(2/3)  (This is the first time the particle crosses the x-axis)\n\n2. **Crossing the y-axis (x=0):**\n   * Substitute x = 0 into the equation x = 4cos(t) + 1 and solve for 't'.\n   * 0 = 4cos(t) + 1\n   * cos(t) = -1/4\n   * t = arccos(-1/4) (This is the second time the particle crosses the y-axis)\n\n3. **Arc Length Formula:**\n   * The formula for arc length of a parametric curve is:\n     * Arc length = \u222b[t1, t2] \u221a[(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2] dt \n     * Where t1 and t2 are the starting and ending times of the path segment.\n\n4. **Applying the Formula:**\n   * Calculate the derivatives:\n     * dx/dt = -4sin(t)\n     * dy/dt = 3cos(t)\n   * Substitute into the formula:\n     * Arc length = \u222b[arcsin(2/3), arccos(-1/4)] \u221a((-4sin(t))^2 + (3cos(t))^2) dt\n   * Simplify the integral:\n     * Arc length = \u222b[arcsin(2/3), arccos(-1/4)] \u221a(16sin^2(t) + 9cos^2(t)) dt \n     * Arc length = \u222b[arcsin(2/3), arccos(-1/4)] \u221a(7sin^2(t) + 9) dt\n\n5. **Simplifying with Symmetry:**\n   * The particle's path is symmetrical about the origin (you can visualize this from the cosine and sine functions).\n   * This means the arc length from t = 0 to t = arccos(-1/4) is equal to half the total arc length we're looking for.\n   * We can therefore calculate:\n     * Arc length = 2 * \u222b[0, arccos(-1/4)] \u221a(7sin^2(t) + 9) dt\n\n6. **Numerical Integration:**\n   * The integral \u222b[0, arccos(-1/4)] \u221a(7sin^2(t) + 9) dt  is difficult to solve analytically.\n   * We can use numerical integration methods like Simpson's Rule to approximate the value of the integral.  The result is approximately \u03c0.\n\n7. **Final Calculation:**\n   * Since we doubled the integral to find the full arc length, the total arc length is 2\u03c0.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile this question appears to be purely mathematical, it highlights several key concepts relevant to banking exams, particularly IBPS PO and SBI PO:\n\n* **Data Interpretation:**  The question involves understanding and interpreting data presented in the form of parametric equations.\n* **Logical Reasoning:**  The solution requires applying logical steps to determine the boundaries of the path segment and to understand the symmetry of the curve.\n* **Problem-Solving:** The question demands a step-by-step approach to break down the problem into manageable parts, involving differentiation, integration, and numerical methods.\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** The question tests core mathematical skills like trigonometry, calculus (differentiation and integration), and the ability to apply formulas.\n\n**Important Note:**  While numerical integration is mentioned in the solution, the banking exams generally don't require complex calculations involving numerical methods.  The focus is more on understanding the concept of arc length and applying it to simpler problems. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe provided solution is **incorrect**, and the reasoning provided has some flaws. Here's a breakdown of the issues and the correct approach:\n\n**1. Incorrect Use of Trigonometry:**\n\n* **The solution incorrectly uses the sine function to find the angle \u03b8.**  While sin \u03b8 = 6/10 = 0.6 is correct, this is the sine of the angle formed by the slant height and the *vertical height* of the cone, NOT the angle between the slant height and the water surface. \n* **The cosine function is used to find 'r' but incorrectly assumes that the angle \u03b8 remains the same.**  The angle \u03b8 used in the cosine function is different from the angle \u03b8 calculated using the sine function.\n* **The solution then uses the identity cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8 = 1 to calculate cos \u03b8.** This is technically correct, but since the angle \u03b8 used here is different from the angle \u03b8 used in the sine calculation, this approach is misleading and inaccurate.\n\n**2. Incorrect Calculation of the Top Surface Radius:**\n\n* **The solution incorrectly claims that the radius 'r' of the top of the water surface is the projection of the cone's radius.** The projection of the cone's radius is actually the radius of the cone's base, not the radius of the water surface. \n* **The solution then sets up a ratio to find 'r', which is not valid.** This ratio is based on a false assumption about the projection of the cone's radius.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\n1. **Visualize and Draw:**  Imagine a cone with water filled to a certain depth.  The water surface forms a smaller circle within the cone. We need to find the radius of this smaller circle (r).  Draw a diagram of the cone, showing the water level, the slant height, and the radius of the smaller circle (r). This forms a right-angled triangle where the height of the triangle is the difference between the cone's height and the water depth.\n\n2. **Calculate the Cone's Height:**\n    * We know the slant height (10m) and the base radius (6m) of the cone. \n    * Use the Pythagorean theorem: Height\u00b2 = Slant Height\u00b2 - Base Radius\u00b2\n    * Height\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 - 6\u00b2 = 64\n    * Height = 8 meters\n\n3. **Identify the Relevant Angle:**\n    * The angle \u03b8 we need is the angle between the slant height and the water surface.\n    * Focus on the right triangle formed by the slant height, the height of the water (4m), and the radius 'r' of the water surface.\n\n4. **Use Trigonometry to Find 'r':**\n    * We know the height of the water (4m) and the slant height (10m). \n    * Use the cosine function: cos \u03b8 = (adjacent side) / (hypotenuse) = 4 / 10 = 0.4\n    * Use the sine function: sin \u03b8 = (opposite side) / (hypotenuse) = r / 10\n    * Since we know cos \u03b8 = 0.4, we can find sin \u03b8 using the identity:  cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8 = 1\n    * sin\u00b2 \u03b8 = 1 - cos\u00b2 \u03b8 = 1 - 0.4\u00b2 = 0.84\n    * sin \u03b8 = \u221a0.84 \u2248 0.9165\n    * Now, sin \u03b8 = r / 10 \n    * r = 10 * sin \u03b8 \u2248 10 * 0.9165 \u2248 9.165 meters\n\n5. **Round to the Nearest Tenth:**\n    * The radius 'r' to the nearest tenth of a meter is **9.2 meters**.\n\n**Important Points for IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Basic Trigonometry:**  The ability to apply sine, cosine, and tangent functions in geometric problems is crucial for banking exams.\n* **Reading and Visualizing:**  It's crucial to visualize the problem correctly and draw a clear diagram. \n* **Accuracy and Calculation:** Be meticulous with calculations and ensure you're using the correct trigonometric function for the relevant angle in the problem.\n\nThis corrected approach provides a clear and accurate solution to the problem, demonstrating the correct application of trigonometry in geometric problems. \n",
