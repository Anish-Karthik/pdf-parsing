Here's why:\n\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The fundamental rule in English grammar is that the verb in a sentence must agree with its subject in number.  This means that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb.\n* **Identifying the Subject:** In the sentence \"One of the apples _____ already eaten,\" the subject is \"one\". This is because the phrase \"of the apples\" acts as a modifier, describing the specific \"one\" apple being referred to.\n* **Singular Subject, Singular Verb:**  \"One\" is a singular noun. Therefore, the verb must also be singular.  The singular form of the verb \"to be\" in the present tense is \"is\". \n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    * **B) are:** This is the plural form of the verb \"to be,\" and it doesn't agree with the singular subject \"one.\"\n    * **C) has:** This is the singular form of the verb \"to have,\" which is not appropriate in this context because the sentence is describing a state of being, not possession.\n    * **D) have:** This is the plural form of the verb \"to have,\" and it doesn't agree with the singular subject \"one.\"\n\n**Key Takeaway:** When dealing with phrases like \"one of the...\" in subject-verb agreement questions, focus on identifying the actual subject, which is usually \"one,\" and use the singular form of the verb accordingly. \n",

This means if the subject is singular, the verb must be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural.\n2. **Identifying the Subject:**  The subject of the sentence is \"mice\", which is a plural noun.\n3. **Choosing the Correct Verb:** The verb in the sentence is \"run\" which has two forms: \"run\" (plural) and \"runs\" (singular). Since the subject \"mice\" is plural, the correct verb is \"run\".\n\n**Therefore, the correct sentence is \"The mice run across the kitchen floor.\"**\n\n**Why this is important for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Grammar is a crucial part of the English language section:**  These exams test your proficiency in English grammar, which includes subject-verb agreement.  \n* **Understanding Subject-Verb Agreement:**  This concept ensures your sentences are grammatically correct and easy to understand. \n* **Improving Your Language Skills:** A strong grasp of grammar helps you communicate effectively in written and spoken English, which is essential in various banking roles.\n\n**Here are some additional tips for remembering subject-verb agreement:**\n\n* **Identify the subject first:**  Always find the subject of the sentence before determining the correct verb.\n* **Be aware of tricky subjects:** Words like \"everyone\", \"someone\", and \"anyone\" are singular even though they sound plural.\n* **Watch out for collective nouns:** Nouns like \"team\", \"family\", and \"committee\" can be singular or plural depending on the context.\n\nBy understanding subject-verb agreement, you can confidently tackle grammar-related questions in your competitive exams and enhance your overall communication skills. \n",

It's like saying \"these cookies\" or \"these delicious treats.\" \n3. **Plural Verb \"are\":** Since the subject is plural, the verb must also be plural. The correct plural form of the verb \"to be\" in the present tense is \"are.\"  \n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **\"is\" and \"was\" are singular verbs.** They would be used if the subject was singular, like \"This cookie is baked fresh.\" \n* **\"were\" is the past tense of \"are\".**  The sentence refers to the present tense, not the past, so \"were\" is incorrect. \n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\nUnderstanding subject-verb agreement is crucial for accurate English writing and speaking. This concept is frequently tested in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. You can apply this knowledge to solve similar questions by:\n\n1. **Identifying the subject:** Find the noun or pronoun that performs the action.\n2. **Determining its number:** Is it singular (one) or plural (more than one)? \n3. **Choosing the correct verb form:** Make sure the verb agrees with the subject in number.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **\"Those\" works the same way as \"these\"**:  Both are plural pronouns and require a plural verb.

Think of it like this:  \"The Hobbit\" is the name of one specific book, not multiple books. \n* **Present Tense:** The sentence is in the present tense, indicating that the book remains a beloved children's fantasy novel even today.

This means if the subject is singular, the verb must be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural. \n\n**Analyzing the Sentence:**\n\n* **Subject:** The subject of the sentence is \"team\", which is a plural noun. \n* **Prepositional Phrase:** The phrase \"along with their coach\" is a prepositional phrase. It modifies the subject but doesn't change its plurality. Think of it as additional information about the team, not a separate subject.\n* **Verb:** The verb needs to agree with the subject \"team\". Since \"team\" is plural, the verb should also be plural.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **\"is\" (Option A):** \"Is\" is a singular verb and does not agree with the plural subject \"team\".\n* **\"are\" (Option B):** While \"are\" is plural, it's used for the present tense, not the past tense as implied in the sentence.\n* **\"was\" (Option C):** \"Was\" is a singular verb in the past tense, but it doesn't match the plural subject \"team\".\n\n**Applying This Knowledge to Other Sentences**\n\nThis concept applies to many other sentences where there might be phrases or clauses inserted between the subject and the verb. Here's a general rule of thumb:\n\n* **Focus on the Main Subject:** Identify the main subject of the sentence. Ignore any prepositional phrases or clauses that might come between the subject and verb.\n* **Check for Plurality:** Determine whether the subject is singular or plural.\n* **Match the Verb:** Choose the verb that agrees in number with the subject. \n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nSubject-verb agreement questions are common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. They test your understanding of fundamental English grammar, which is crucial for effective communication and understanding in any professional setting.

While \"have\" can be used with \"none,\" it implies possession, which isn't the focus of the sentence.\n\n**Key Takeaway for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nRemember that \"none\" can act as both a singular and plural pronoun depending on the context.

For example:\n\n* \"None of the students ______ finished their assignments.\"\n* \"None of the money ______ been recovered yet.\"\n\nRemember, practicing grammar exercises will help you identify and correctly use \"none\" in different contexts, boosting your performance in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

This means if the subject is singular, the verb must be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural.\n* **The Subject:**  In this sentence, the subject is \"few of the employees.\" While \"few\" might sound singular, it's actually a plural pronoun when it refers to a group of people.  This is because \"few\" implies more than one employee. \n* **The Verb:** Since the subject is plural, the verb needs to be plural as well. \"Were\" is the past tense plural form of the verb \"to be.\" \n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **\"A. is\" and \"C. was\"** are singular forms of the verb \"to be\" and do not agree with the plural subject.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **\"Many\" and \"Few\":** When used with countable nouns (like \"employees\"), \"many\" and \"few\" always take plural verbs. They are considered plural determiners.  \n* **Similar Questions:**  The IBPS PO and SBI PO exams often test subject-verb agreement with words like \"many,\" \"few,\" \"some,\" \"all,\" and \"most.\" Be prepared to identify the subject accurately and choose the correct verb form.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* \"Many of the **candidates** **were** nervous about the exam.\" (Candidates are plural, so 'were' is the correct verb)\n* \"Few of the **questions** **were** difficult.\" (Questions are plural, so 'were' is the correct verb)\n\n**Remember:**  Understanding subject-verb agreement is crucial for achieving accuracy in grammar and improving your overall written communication. \n",

Although \"series\" ends in \"-s\", it is a singular noun. Think of it as a collective noun, referring to a single unit of lectures.\n\n2. **Subject-Verb Agreement:**  The verb must agree with the subject in number. Since the subject \"series\" is singular, we need a singular verb.\n\n3. **Singular Verb Choice:**  The singular verb in the given options is \"has\".\n\n4. **Understanding the Phrase:** The phrase \"on ancient history\" acts as a modifier describing the \"series\". It doesn't change the fact that \"series\" is singular.\n\n**In summary:**  The sentence \"The series of lectures on ancient history **has** been a great success...\" is grammatically correct because the singular subject \"series\" agrees with the singular verb \"has\".\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding subject-verb agreement is crucial for these exams.  Many questions test your ability to identify the correct verb form based on the subject. Here are some key points to remember:\n\n* **Collective Nouns:** Words like \"team\", \"group\", \"series\", \"committee\", etc., often function as singular subjects, even though they represent multiple individuals.\n* **Words Ending in '-s' or '-es':**  Be cautious with nouns ending in '-s' or '-es'.  They can be singular or plural depending on their meaning.\n* **Singular vs. Plural Verb Forms:**  Know the difference between singular and plural verb forms (e.g., \"has\" vs. \"have\", \"is\" vs. \"are\", \"does\" vs. \"do\").\n\n**By mastering these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to tackle similar questions on subject-verb agreement in your banking exam preparation.** \n",

Examples include: *team, committee, family, majority, minority*. \n* The verb used with a collective noun depends on whether the noun is acting as a **singular unit** or as a **group of individuals**.\n\n**Analyzing the Sentence:**\n\n* In this sentence, \"majority\" refers to a **group of individual students**.  It's not acting as a singular unit but rather highlighting the individual actions of the students within the group.\n* **When a collective noun refers to individual members of a group, it takes a plural verb.**\n* Therefore, the correct verb to use is \"have\" (plural), which agrees with the plural subject \"students\".\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n\n* A common mistake is using a singular verb (\"has\") with a collective noun that refers to individuals. This happens when people mistakenly think of the collective noun as a singular entity.\n\n**Key takeaway:** When encountering a collective noun, always analyze whether it represents a single unit or a group of individuals to determine the correct verb agreement. \n",

This means singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs.\n* **The Word 'None':** The word \"none\" is a bit tricky. It can be singular or plural depending on the context. In this case, \"none\" refers to the plural noun \"witnesses\". \n* **Contextual Clue:** The phrase \"None of the witnesses\" clearly indicates that we are talking about multiple witnesses. Since we have a plural subject (\"witnesses\"), we need a plural verb. \n* **Correct Verb:** The plural verb \"were\" correctly agrees with the plural subject \"witnesses.\" \n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A) was:** This is the singular form of the verb 'to be', and it does not agree with the plural subject \"witnesses\".\n* **C) is:** Similar to 'was', 'is' is also a singular verb and does not agree with the plural subject. \n* **D) are:** While 'are' is plural, it doesn't fit the context of the sentence.

The phrase \"one of the proposals\" refers to a single proposal. \n* **\"Team\" is part of a prepositional phrase** (\"by the team\") modifying the noun \"proposals\".

Therefore, the correct verb is the singular \"is\". The phrase \"who submitted incomplete applications\" is a relative clause describing the applicants, not the number itself.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* **Correct:** The number of students **is** impressive this year.\n* **Incorrect:** The number of students **are** impressive this year.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(b) are:** Incorrect because \"are\" is a plural verb, and the subject is singular.\n* **(c) has:** Incorrect because \"has\" is the third person singular present tense, but the subject is \"The number of\" (which is third person singular but not a singular noun). \n* **(d) have:** Incorrect because \"have\" is the third person plural present tense, and the subject is singular.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nSubject-verb agreement is a crucial concept tested in the English Language section of these exams.

It's important to understand how these pronouns function grammatically and how they relate to their antecedents. \n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Mastering relative pronoun usage:**  Know when to use \"who,\" \"which,\" \"that,\" and \"whose\" correctly.\n* **Understanding subject-verb agreement:** Ensure the verb agrees with the subject in number and tense, even within relative clauses.\n* **Identifying grammatical errors:** Be able to spot incorrect pronoun usage or subject-verb agreement errors in sentences. \n\nBy focusing on these areas, you'll improve your performance in English language sections of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **(a) meets**. Here's why:\n\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The fundamental rule is that the verb must agree in number with its subject. In this sentence, the subject is \"neither,\" which is a singular indefinite pronoun.  \n* **Singular Indefinite Pronouns:** Indefinite pronouns like *neither*, *either*, *each*, *every*, *anyone*, *everyone*, *no one*, and *someone* are always singular. They refer to a single entity, even if they seem to refer to a group.\n* **Correct Verb Form:** Since \"neither\" is singular, the verb needs to be singular as well. The correct singular form of the verb \"to meet\" in the present tense is \"meets.\" \n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(b) meet:** This is a plural form of the verb, which does not agree with the singular subject \"neither.\"\n* **(c) has met:** This uses the past perfect tense, which isn't appropriate in the context of the sentence. \n* **(d) have met:**  This is again a plural verb, not matching the singular subject \"neither.\"\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  \n\nFor exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, mastering subject-verb agreement is crucial. Pay close attention to indefinite pronouns. Remember that they are always singular, even if they seem to represent multiple things.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **More Examples:**\n    * Neither **of the applicants** **is** qualified for the job. \n    * Each **of the candidates** **has** submitted their application.\n* **Common Mistakes:**  A common mistake is to assume that because \"neither\" refers to \"two proposals,\" it should take a plural verb. However, \"neither\" itself acts as a single unit, and therefore the verb must agree with it. \n* **Practice:** To strengthen your understanding, practice identifying singular and plural indefinite pronouns and then choose the correct verb form to match. You can find plenty of practice questions in textbooks and online resources. \n",

This means if the subject is singular, the verb must be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural.\n* **\"A plethora of\" as a Singular Unit:** In the sentence, the subject is \"a plethora of opportunities.\"  While \"opportunities\" itself is plural, the phrase \"a plethora of\" acts as a collective noun, signifying a large quantity of something. This entire phrase is considered singular, hence requiring a singular verb. \n* **\"Is\" as the Correct Verb:** Since the subject (\"a plethora of opportunities\") is singular, the verb must also be singular.  \"Is\" is the correct singular present tense verb.\n\n**Here are some additional points to remember:**\n\n* **\"There\" and \"Here\" as Introductory Words:**  In sentences starting with \"there\" or \"here,\" the true subject usually follows the verb. For example, \"There are many opportunities\" (subject: opportunities).\n* **Collective Nouns:** These nouns represent a group of individuals or things (e.g., team, family, flock). They can be singular or plural depending on the context. If the noun is acting as a single unit, it takes a singular verb.  If it refers to individual members, it takes a plural verb.\n\n**Example:** \n* \"The team is playing well.\" (The team is acting as a single unit.)\n* \"The team members are having lunch.\" (The focus is on individual members.)\n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\nFor IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, understanding Subject-Verb Agreement is crucial.

Understanding how \"more than one\" functions as a singular subject is crucial for these exams.  Here are some additional points to remember:\n\n* **\"More than one\" vs. \"More than one...\" + plural noun:** While \"more than one\" is singular, if it's followed by a plural noun, the verb will agree with the plural noun.

Here's why:\n\n* **Understanding the Sentence Structure:** The sentence contains a relative clause, which is a clause that modifies a noun. In this case, the relative clause is \"____ were planning a surprise party for their teacher.\" This clause describes the group of students.\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:**  The key to choosing the right pronoun lies in understanding subject-verb agreement. The relative pronoun must agree with the noun it refers to in terms of number (singular or plural). \n* **'Which' vs. 'Who'**:  \n    * 'Which' is used to refer to things or groups of people. \n    * 'Who' is used to refer to people.\n* **The Sentence Analysis:**\n    * The noun \"group\" is plural.\n    * The verb \"were planning\" is also plural, indicating that the subject of the relative clause is plural.\n    * Therefore, the correct relative pronoun is \"which,\" which agrees with the plural subject \"group.\"\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    * **(b) who:** 'Who' is used for people, not groups of people.\n    * **(c) that:** While 'that' can be used for both people and things, it's generally considered more formal. 'Which' is more appropriate in this context. \n    * **(d) whom:**  'Whom' is the objective case of 'who' and is used when the pronoun is the object of a verb or preposition. In this sentence, the pronoun is the subject of the verb 'were planning.'\n\n**In Summary:**  The correct answer is \"which\" because it agrees in number with the plural noun \"group\" and correctly acts as the subject of the relative clause. \n\n**For IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding subject-verb agreement with relative pronouns is crucial for these exams. Practice similar questions focusing on the distinction between \"which\" and \"who\" and their usage in different sentence structures. \n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Identify the Noun:**  Always determine the noun the relative clause modifies.\n* **Check the Verb:** Ensure the verb in the relative clause agrees in number with the noun.\n* **Choose the Correct Pronoun:** Select the appropriate relative pronoun based on the noun's nature and the context. \n",

This means that if the subject is singular, the verb must also be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural.\n* **Identifying the Subject:**  The subject of the sentence is \"challenges\".  The word \"what\" acts as a pronoun in this case, standing in for the actual subject, which is \"challenges\". \n* **Plural Subject, Plural Verb:** Since \"challenges\" is a plural noun, the verb needs to be plural as well.  The plural form of the verb \"to be\" in the present tense is \"are.\"\n* **Incorrect Options:**\n    * **(a) is:** This is the singular form of the verb \"to be\" and does not agree with the plural subject \"challenges\".\n    * **(c) was:** This is the past tense form of the verb \"to be\" and is not appropriate in the present tense context of the question.\n    * **(d) have:** This is an auxiliary verb and is not the main verb in the sentence.

It is often included in the English Language section and is an easy way to score marks if you understand the rules.  \n\n**Practice Tip:**  To improve your subject-verb agreement skills, practice identifying the subject and verb in various sentences.

Therefore, the subject is plural.\n* **Plural Verb:** To match the plural subject, we need a plural verb. The correct verb is \"are\", which agrees with the plural subject \"symphony of whispers\" and \"chorus of rustling leaves\".\n\n**Therefore, the complete sentence reads:** \"The symphony of whispers, a chorus of rustling leaves, all **are** a mesmerizing melody that enveloped the ancient forest.\"\n\n**Additional Context and Tips for IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\n* **Practice with Different Collective Nouns:** Familiarize yourself with how different collective nouns function in sentences.  Examples include: \n    * **Group:** The group **is** preparing for the exam.\n    * **Team:** The team **is** practicing hard.\n    * **Crowd:** The crowd **is** cheering loudly.\n* **Pay Attention to Context:**  Context is crucial in determining if a collective noun is singular or plural. For example, \"The team **is** united in their purpose\" uses a singular verb because the focus is on the team as a single entity. However, \"The team **are** arguing over their strategies\" uses a plural verb because the focus is on the individual members of the team.\n* **Common Subject-Verb Agreement Errors:**  Be careful of common errors like: \n    * **Mismatched Verb Forms:**  Using singular verbs with plural subjects or vice versa.\n    * **Intervening Phrases:**  Don't let phrases between the subject and verb distract you from their agreement.\n* **Practice, Practice, Practice:** Consistent practice with subject-verb agreement questions will build your confidence and help you master this important grammar concept for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's why:\n\n1. **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The fundamental rule of grammar is that the verb in a sentence must agree with its subject in number. This means if the subject is singular, the verb must also be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural. \n\n2. **The Subject:** In this sentence, the subject is \"changes.\" The word \"changes\" is plural because it refers to multiple changes occurring in the banking industry.\n\n3. **The Verb:**  The verb in the sentence is \"caused.\"  We need to choose the correct form of the verb \"to be\" to complete the sentence.  \"Are\" is the plural form of the verb \"to be\" in the present tense, which correctly agrees with the plural subject \"changes.\" \n\n4. **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    * **(A) has:**  \"Has\" is the singular third-person present tense form of \"have.\" It does not agree with the plural subject \"changes.\"\n    * **(B) have:** While \"have\" is the plural form of \"has,\" it is in the present perfect tense, which is not appropriate in this context.  The sentence is describing a present situation, not a completed action.\n    * **(C) is:** \"Is\" is the singular third-person present tense form of \"be.\" It does not agree with the plural subject \"changes.\"\n\n**In a nutshell:** The sentence \"A lot of the recent changes in the banking industry **are** caused by technological advancements\" is grammatically correct because the verb \"are\" is in the plural form and agrees with the plural subject \"changes.\" \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **\"A lot of\" and \"Lots of\":** These phrases are often used to indicate a large quantity or number. When they are followed by a plural noun (like \"changes\"), the verb should also be in the plural form. \n* **Subject-Verb Agreement with Collective Nouns:** Sometimes, collective nouns (words that refer to a group of people or things) can be tricky.  For example, \"team\" is a collective noun.  If the team is acting as a single unit, the verb will be singular. However, if the members of the team are acting individually, the verb will be plural.\n\n**Applying this knowledge to other questions:**\n\nYou can use the same logic for similar questions involving subject-verb agreement with \"a lot of\" and \"lots of.\" Just remember to identify the subject of the sentence and ensure the verb agrees with it in number.\n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Subject-Verb Agreement:**\n\nSubject-verb agreement is a fundamental grammatical rule that dictates the verb in a sentence must match the subject in number (singular or plural). This means if the subject is singular, the verb must be singular as well.  Similarly, if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural.\n\n**The Subject:**\n\nIn this sentence, the subject is **\"no one\"**.  This is a singular indefinite pronoun. Indefinite pronouns refer to unspecified people or things.  \n\n**The Trick:**\n\nThe phrase \"not even the most experienced detectives\" can be misleading. It seems to suggest a group of detectives, making us think the verb should be plural. However, this phrase is a prepositional phrase modifying the subject \"no one,\" not a separate subject.\n\n**The Verb:**\n\nThe verb in the sentence is **\"able\"**. To make it agree with the singular subject \"no one,\" we need the singular past tense form of the verb \"to be,\" which is **\"was\"**.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **\"were\":** This is the plural past tense form of \"to be,\" which doesn't agree with the singular subject \"no one.\"\n* **\"have\":** This is the present tense form of the verb \"to have,\" and the sentence requires the past tense.\n* **\"has\":** This is the singular present tense form of the verb \"to have,\" and it doesn't fit the tense and number requirements of the sentence.\n\n**Key takeaway for Subject-Verb Agreement with Indefinite Pronouns:**\n\n* **Singular Indefinite Pronouns:**  Words like \"no one,\" \"nobody,\" \"nothing,\" \"everyone,\" \"everybody,\" \"everything,\" \"someone,\" \"somebody,\" \"something,\" \"anyone,\" \"anybody,\" \"anything,\" \"each,\" and \"either\" are singular. They require a singular verb.\n* **Focus on the Subject:** Always identify the subject of the sentence before choosing the correct verb form. Don't be misled by prepositional phrases or other modifiers that may seem to suggest a plural subject.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO & SBI PO:**\n\nSubject-verb agreement is a crucial concept tested in grammar sections of various banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams assess a candidate's understanding of fundamental grammar rules, including subject-verb agreement, to ensure clear and accurate communication skills. Mastering this concept will significantly improve your score in the English Language section. \n",

This means singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs.\n\n2. **Identifying the Subject:** In this sentence, the subject is \"team of engineers\". Even though the phrase includes the word \"team\", which is singular, the actual subject is \"engineers,\" which is a plural noun.  This is because \"team\" is a collective noun, referring to a group of individuals.\n\n3. **Choosing the Correct Verb:**  Since the subject is plural (\"engineers\"), we need a plural verb. Of the options provided:\n    * \"is\" and \"has\" are singular verbs.\n    * \"are\" and \"have\" are plural verbs.\n\n4. **Tense Consideration:** The sentence is in the present continuous tense, which uses the present participle of the verb (working) along with the auxiliary verb \"be\" or \"have\". Since the subject is plural, the correct auxiliary verb is \"are\" (plural form of \"to be\").\n\n**In summary:** The sentence requires a plural verb to agree with the plural subject \"engineers,\" and the present continuous tense necessitates the use of \"are\" as the auxiliary verb. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Collective Nouns:**  Collective nouns can be tricky as they refer to groups but are often treated as singular.  However, when the collective noun is emphasizing the individual members of the group, it takes a plural verb.  In this case, the focus is on the \"engineers\" working together, hence the plural verb.\n* **IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**  These exams test your understanding of basic grammar concepts like subject-verb agreement, verb tenses, and parts of speech. This type of question is designed to assess your ability to identify the correct grammatical structure within a sentence. \n\n**Applying the Knowledge:**\n\nTo answer similar questions correctly:\n\n1. **Identify the subject:** Determine the noun or pronoun that is performing the action of the verb.\n2. **Check its number:**  Is the subject singular or plural?\n3. **Choose the correct verb:**  Select the verb form that matches the number of the subject.\n4. **Consider the tense:** Ensure the verb is in the correct tense based on the context of the sentence.\n\nBy following these steps, you can improve your accuracy and confidence in answering grammar-based questions in competitive exams. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Subject-Verb Agreement**\n\nSubject-verb agreement is a fundamental grammar rule that dictates that the verb in a sentence must match the subject in number (singular or plural). This rule applies even when using relative pronouns like 'who' and 'whoever'.\n\n**Analyzing the Sentence**\n\nThe sentence is: \"The candidate ____ chosen for the interview was the most qualified applicant.\"\n\n* **Subject:** The subject of the sentence is \"candidate\", which is singular. \n* **Relative Clause:**  The phrase \"____ chosen for the interview\" is a relative clause that modifies the noun \"candidate\". \n* **Relative Pronoun:**  The relative pronoun 'who' acts as the subject of the relative clause. Since 'who' refers back to \"candidate\" (a singular noun), the verb in the relative clause must also be singular.\n\n**Why \"who was\" is Correct**\n\n* **\"who was\"** correctly uses the singular verb \"was\" to agree with the singular subject \"who\" (referring to the singular \"candidate\").\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **\"who were\"** uses the plural verb \"were\" incorrectly. It doesn't agree with the singular subject \"who\".\n* **\"whom was\"** uses the incorrect pronoun \"whom\". \"Whom\" is the objective case pronoun and should be used as the object of a verb or preposition. Here, \"who\" is the subject of the relative clause and thus should be used in the nominative case.\n* **\"whom were\"** is incorrect for both reasons mentioned above - it uses the wrong pronoun and the wrong verb form.\n\n**Key Takeaway**\n\nWhen using 'who' or 'whoever' in a relative clause, the verb must agree with the antecedent of the pronoun (the noun it refers to). If the antecedent is singular, use a singular verb. If the antecedent is plural, use a plural verb.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* **Singular:** The student **who was** chosen for the scholarship is from Delhi. (The antecedent of 'who' is 'student', which is singular.)\n* **Plural:** The students **who were** chosen for the scholarship are from different states. (The antecedent of 'who' is 'students', which is plural.)\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams**\n\nThese exams often test grammar and vocabulary, including subject-verb agreement. Understanding this concept is crucial for answering questions accurately and efficiently. Practice using this rule in various sentence structures to master it for exam success. \n",

Conversely, if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural.\n\n**Analyzing the Sentence:**\n\n* **Subject:** The subject of the sentence is \"research,\" which is a singular noun.\n* **Verb:**  We need to choose the correct verb to match the singular subject \"research\".\n* **Intervening Phrase:** The phrase \"which has been widely publicized\" is a relative clause modifying the subject \"research\". This phrase does not affect the grammatical number of the subject. \n\n**Why the Correct Answer is \"Indicates\":**\n\nThe verb \"indicates\" is the singular present tense form of the verb \"indicate.\" This form correctly agrees with the singular subject \"research.\"\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A) indicate:** This is the plural form of the verb, making it incorrect with a singular subject.\n* **C) are indicating:** This is the present continuous tense, implying an action ongoing at the moment. The sentence implies a general statement about research findings, not a continuous action.\n* **D) have indicated:**  This is the present perfect tense, implying an action completed in the past with a result in the present.

This implies that **not a single** solution was feasible, which is why \"nothing\" is the correct choice.\n\n**Subject-Verb Agreement with \"Something, Anything, Everything\":**\n\nThe principle behind this question lies in understanding subject-verb agreement with words like \"something\", \"anything\", \"everything\", and in this case, \"nothing\".

It wouldn't make sense in this context because the sentence is about a lack of feasible solutions in general, not specifically two solutions.\n* **\"Every\"** implies that all solutions were feasible, contradicting the sentence's meaning that none of the solutions were feasible.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n\"Nothing\" is the correct choice because it accurately reflects the sentence's meaning:  none of the proposed solutions were feasible in the current financial climate.

In this case, the subjects are \"meticulous planning\" and \"tireless efforts.\" Since \"tireless efforts\" is closer to the verb, the verb should agree with it.\n\n**Singular Subject, Singular Verb**\n\n\"Tireless efforts\" is a singular noun phrase.  It refers to a collective group of efforts, even though it might seem plural.  Therefore, the verb must also be singular.

The phrase \"nestled amongst the vibrant blooms\" describes the location of the orchid, not the subject itself. \n* **Singular Verb:**  Since the subject is singular, the correct verb form is \"is\".  The other options (\"are\", \"was\", and \"were\") are all plural forms and do not agree with the singular subject.\n\n**Key Takeaway for IBPS PO & SBI PO:**\n\nSubject-verb agreement questions are common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  These questions often use tricky sentence structures, making it important to identify the true subject accurately. In this case, identifying the subject as \"a rare species of orchid\" is crucial for choosing the correct verb form.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThe question focuses on a common error in subject-verb agreement involving the words \"here\" and \"there\".  While \"here\" and \"there\" may appear to be the subject, they are actually introductory words that do not take a verb. The true subject comes after these introductory words.\n\n**Example:** \n\n* **Incorrect:** There is many students in the class.\n* **Correct:** There are many students in the class. \n\n**Practice Tip:**\n\n* **Isolate the Subject:**  When encountering a sentence with \"here\" or \"there\", always look for the true subject that comes after these words.\n* **Pay Attention to Number:**  Make sure the verb agrees in number with the subject (singular or plural).\n\nBy understanding subject-verb agreement principles and identifying the true subject, you can confidently tackle similar questions in your banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **(A) 'did'**. Here's why:\n\n**1. Inverted Sentence Structure:**\n\nThe sentence is in an inverted structure, meaning the usual subject-verb order is reversed.  Instead of \"The explorers finally reached...\", we have \"Only after... did the explorers finally reach...\". This inversion is often used for emphasis or stylistic reasons.\n\n**2. Subject-Verb Agreement:**\n\n* **Subject:** The subject of the sentence is \"explorers\", which is a plural noun. \n* **Verb:** The verb must agree with the subject in number and tense.  \n* **Past Tense:**  The sentence describes a completed action in the past (the explorers reached the civilization). This means we need a past tense verb.\n\n**3. 'Did' as the Correct Verb:**\n\n* **'Did' is the past tense of the auxiliary verb 'do'.**  It is used to form questions and negatives in simple past tense. \n* **In this case, 'did' acts as a helping verb.** It helps to create the inverted sentence structure and emphasizes the past tense.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **'Do' is the present tense of the auxiliary verb 'do'.** It doesn't fit the past tense context of the sentence.\n* **'Has' and 'have' are present perfect tense verbs.** They imply an action that began in the past and continues to the present. The sentence indicates a completed action in the past.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nWhen dealing with inverted sentence structures, always focus on identifying the subject and the verb. The verb must agree with the subject in number and tense, even when the sentence order is reversed.\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Subject-verb agreement is a fundamental grammar concept frequently tested in these exams.**  \n* **Questions may involve various sentence structures, including inverted sentences.**\n* **Candidates must be comfortable identifying the subject and verb, even when they appear in unusual positions.** \n* **Understanding the different tenses and their correct usage is crucial.**\n\n**By mastering subject-verb agreement and recognizing inverted structures, candidates can confidently tackle grammar questions in the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams.** \n",

While \"none\" can sometimes be singular, it is **plural in this case** because it refers to the plural noun \"designs\".  Think of it this way:  \"None of the designs\" means \"not one of the designs,\" implying multiple designs. \n\n3. **The Verb: 'Were'**  Since the subject \"none\" is plural, the verb needs to be plural as well.  The correct plural form of the verb \"to be\" in this context is \"were\". \n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(a) was:**  This is a singular verb form and doesn't agree with the plural subject \"none\".\n* **(c) has been:**  This is a singular verb form in the present perfect tense, but the sentence requires the past tense.\n* **(d) have been:**  While this is the correct plural form of the present perfect tense, the sentence is in the simple past tense, so this option is incorrect.\n\n**In summary:**  The sentence requires a plural verb to agree with the plural subject \"none\". The past tense verb \"were\" is the only option that correctly aligns with both the subject and the tense of the sentence.\n\n**Key takeaway:**  When \"none\" refers to a plural noun, it acts as a plural subject, requiring a plural verb. \n\n**Additional Context:**  This question tests your understanding of subject-verb agreement, a crucial concept in English grammar. It's frequently tested in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, which assess your proficiency in English language and reasoning skills. \n",

Therefore, the verb needs to be plural as well. So, \"are\" is the correct choice.\n\n* **\"...but also the unwavering commitment of the stakeholders, who _[blank]_ consistently provided their support...\"** The subject here is \"commitment\" which is singular.

The verb needs to be singular, hence \"is\" is the correct choice.\n\n**2. Parallel Structure:**\n\nThe sentence uses the \"not only... but also\" construction, which emphasizes parallelism. This means that the grammatical structure following both \"not only\" and \"but also\" should be similar. \n\n* The first part uses \"efforts are crucial...\"\n* The second part uses \"commitment has... support is...\"\n\nThis structure maintains parallelism, creating a grammatically sound and balanced sentence.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is option B because it correctly aligns the verbs with their corresponding subjects and maintains the parallel structure of the sentence.

Here's why:\n\n1. **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The fundamental principle in English grammar is that the verb in a sentence must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural). This means if the subject is singular, the verb should also be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb should be plural.\n\n2. **Identifying the Subject:**  In this sentence, the subjects are \"research\" and \"analysis\".  We need to focus on the core subjects, not the additional clauses.\n\n3. **'Neither...nor' Structure:** When using the conjunction \"neither...nor\", the verb agrees with the subject that is closer to it.  In this case, the subject closer to the verb is \"analysis\", which is singular. \n\n4. **Singular Verb:** Since the subject closer to the verb is singular (\"analysis\"), the verb must also be singular. Therefore, \"was\" is the correct choice as it is the singular past tense form of the verb \"to be\".\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement with 'Both...and' and 'Neither...nor':**\n    * **Both...and**: When using \"both...and\", the verb is always plural, as it refers to two or more things.\n    * **Neither...nor**: The verb agrees with the subject closest to it, which can be singular or plural depending on the context.\n\n* **Important Note:**  Pay close attention to the core subjects in complex sentences. Ignore any modifying clauses or phrases that might distract you from the true subject-verb agreement.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* **Incorrect:** Neither the research nor the analysis *were* able to provide a solution. (The verb \"were\" is plural, but the subjects are singular.)\n* **Correct:** Neither the research nor the analysis *was* able to provide a solution. (The verb \"was\" is singular, agreeing with the singular subject \"analysis\".)\n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\n* By understanding subject-verb agreement rules, especially with structures like \"neither...nor\", you can confidently tackle similar questions in your IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n* Practice identifying the subjects and the verbs in different sentence structures to solidify your grasp on this concept. \n",

The intervening phrase doesn't change the fact that the subject is singular, so the verb must be singular too.**\n\n**Key Takeaway for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement is crucial:**  Be extra careful with sentences containing phrases and clauses between the subject and verb. The subject remains the subject, even with these additions.\n* **Focus on the Core Subject:** Identify the subject and its number (singular or plural) to determine the correct verb form.\n* **Don't be distracted by intervening phrases:**  Non-restrictive clauses provide extra information but don't affect the subject-verb agreement.\n\n**Example:**\n\nThe *mountain*, which *stands tall and proud*, *is* a popular hiking spot.\n\n* **Subject:** Mountain (singular)\n* **Intervening Phrase:** which stands tall and proud\n* **Verb:** is (singular)\n\n**Practice Tip:**  While preparing for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, focus on identifying subjects and verbs quickly and accurately. Practice with diverse sentence structures to build a strong grasp of subject-verb agreement. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **\"has\"**. Here's why:\n\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The fundamental rule of subject-verb agreement is that the verb must agree in number (singular or plural) with its subject.  In this sentence, the subject is \"**fact**\". \n* **Identifying the Subject:** The phrase \"with its focus on long-term growth and minimal risk\" modifies \"investment strategy\" and is not the subject of the sentence.  It's a descriptive phrase that adds information about the strategy, but doesn't change the subject.\n* **Singular Subject, Singular Verb:** Since \"fact\" is a singular noun, the verb must also be singular. \"Has\" is the singular form of the verb \"to have,\" making it the correct choice.\n\n**In simpler terms:**\n\nImagine the sentence without the extra details: \"The fact... has consistently outperformed the market.\"  The focus is clearly on the \"fact\", and not the investment strategy.\n\n**Additional Context and Learning Points:**\n\n* **\"This\" and \"That\" as Subjects:**  The words \"this\" and \"that\" are often used as subjects, and it's important to understand how they work. They act as pronouns, replacing a noun or noun phrase, and their number (singular or plural) depends on the noun they are referring to. For example: \n    * \"This investment strategy has... \" (singular)\n    * \"These investment strategies have... \" (plural)\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement in Complex Sentences:** Be cautious with complex sentences with multiple clauses or phrases.  Always identify the main subject of the sentence to ensure the verb agrees with it.\n* **Common Errors in Subject-Verb Agreement:** Pay attention to:\n    * **Collective nouns:**  Words like \"team,\" \"family,\" or \"committee\" can be singular or plural depending on the context.\n    * **Words ending in \"-s\":** Some words ending in \"-s\" (like \"news\") are singular.\n    * **Intervening phrases:** Don't be fooled by phrases that come between the subject and verb, as these don't affect the verb's number.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nSubject-Verb agreement is a crucial grammar concept frequently tested in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

This choice demonstrates the crucial principle of subject-verb agreement, a fundamental concept tested in various competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Subject:**\n\nThe subject of the sentence is \"**analysis**\".  While \"data\" might seem like the subject due to its prominent position, it's actually the object of the preposition \"of\".  The sentence focuses on the action of the analysis itself, not the data being analyzed.\n\n**Nouns Ending in '-ics':**\n\nWords ending in '-ics', like \"analysis,\" \"physics,\" \"politics,\" etc., often cause confusion in subject-verb agreement. Although these words sound plural, they are generally considered singular nouns. This is because they represent a single, unified concept or field of study.\n\n**Verb Agreement:**\n\nSince the subject \"analysis\" is singular, the verb must also be singular. This eliminates options \"a) reveal\" and \"d) revealed\", which are plural and past tense forms, respectively. Option \"c) revealing\" is a present participle, acting as an adjective modifying \"analysis,\" and not a verb in the present tense. \n\n**Why \"b) reveals\" is correct:**\n\nThe singular present tense verb \"reveals\" accurately reflects the singular subject \"analysis\". The sentence describes the ongoing action of the analysis revealing a startling revelation.\n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO & SBI PO:**\n\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:**  Always ensure the verb agrees with the subject in number (singular or plural).\n* **Nouns Ending in '-ics':** These words are usually singular, even though they sound plural.\n* **Identifying the Subject:** Carefully analyze the sentence structure to identify the true subject, paying attention to prepositions and phrases. \n* **Context is Key:** Understanding the context of the sentence is crucial for choosing the correct verb tense and form.\n\nBy mastering these concepts and practicing with similar questions, aspiring candidates can improve their performance in the verbal ability section of these competitive exams. \n",

This means if the subject is singular, the verb should be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb should be plural.\n\n2. **Identifying the Subject:** In this sentence, the main subject is \"some of the proposals.\"  While the phrases \"various departments\" and \"committee\" are also plural, they are acting as modifiers, providing additional information about the proposals. The core of the sentence revolves around the proposals.\n\n3. **Plural Subject:**  The phrase \"some of the proposals\" is plural. The word \"some\" often takes the number of the noun it modifies. Since \"proposals\" is plural, \"some\" is also considered plural.\n\n4. **Correct Verb:**  The verb \"have\" is the plural form of the verb \"to have.\" It correctly agrees with the plural subject \"proposals.\"\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **\"has\"** is the singular form of the verb \"to have\" and does not agree with the plural subject \"proposals.\"\n* **\"are\"** and **\"is\"** are forms of the verb \"to be\" and do not fit the context of the sentence.  They are not appropriate to describe the action of being \"deemed suitable.\" \n\n**Additional Context for the IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\n* **Subject-verb agreement** is a crucial topic for these banking exams. It often appears in grammar-based sections testing sentence correction and error spotting.\n* **Tricky Subjects:** Watch out for sentences with phrases like \"some of,\" \"many of,\" \"most of,\" etc. These phrases can be confusing because the noun that comes after \"of\" may not be the actual subject. Always focus on the noun that the phrase modifies.\n* **Practice:**  Mastering subject-verb agreement requires practice. Work through various exercises and examples to identify the subject accurately and select the correct verb form.\n\nRemember, understanding the subject-verb agreement rule and its nuances can help you confidently tackle such questions in your banking exams. \n",

Here's why:\n\n1. **Relative Pronoun Function:**  The blank requires a relative pronoun to connect the main clause (\"The esteemed group of financial analysts...presented their findings...\") with a relative clause (\"many of [blank] have earned prestigious awards...\").  Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses and act as the subject or object within that clause.\n\n2. **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The relative clause is \"many of [blank] have earned prestigious awards...\".

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided question focuses on **subject-verb agreement**, a crucial concept for grammar and particularly important for exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  While the question doesn't explicitly involve \"or\" or \"nor\", it highlights the importance of identifying the **true subject** of the sentence, even when multiple nouns are present. Let's break down why the correct answer is **(a) was**:\n\n1. **Identifying the Subject:** The sentence's main subject is \"**committee**\".  Although the phrase \"comprised of both senior executives and a group of highly specialized consultants\" describes the committee, it doesn't change the subject's singular form. \n2. **Collective Nouns:**  \"Committee\" is a **collective noun**, representing a group of individuals. When a collective noun acts as a single unit, it takes a **singular verb**. This is the case here, as the committee is acting as a cohesive entity in its decision-making process.\n3. **Verb Agreement:** Since the subject \"committee\" is singular, the verb must also be singular.  Therefore, the correct verb is \"**was**,\" making option (a) the right choice.\n4. **Eliminating Other Options:**\n    * **(b) were:** This is incorrect because it uses the plural form of the verb, which doesn't agree with the singular subject \"committee.\"\n    * **(c) has been:** While this option uses the correct tense (past perfect), it doesn't agree with the singular subject \"committee.\" \n    * **(d) have been:** This option is incorrect for the same reason as (b) and (c). It uses the plural form of the verb and the wrong tense.\n\n**In essence, the key to this question is recognizing the subject \"committee\" as a singular collective noun and ensuring the verb agrees with it in number.** \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThe question highlights the importance of recognizing collective nouns. While collective nouns can sometimes take a plural verb (e.g., \"The committee were divided on the issue\"), this usually occurs when emphasizing the individual members of the group. In this case, the sentence emphasizes the committee's singular action of failing to reach a unanimous decision.\n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\nThis question demonstrates a common concept tested in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. By mastering subject-verb agreement rules, you can confidently tackle similar questions. Here's a tip:  Always identify the true subject of the sentence, even if other nouns are present. Pay close attention to collective nouns and their usage. \n",

Understanding the Sentence Structure:**\n\nThe sentence consists of two independent clauses:\n\n* **Clause 1:** \"A significant number of the investors, many of whom have been closely following the company's progress, **____** eager to see the latest financial report...\"\n* **Clause 2:** \"...even though a few **____** still hesitant to commit further capital due to recent market fluctuations.\"\n\n**2. Identifying the Subjects:**\n\n* **Clause 1:** The subject is \"many of whom.\" Although the sentence starts with \"A significant number of the investors,\" the phrase \"many of whom\" functions as the subject of this clause. It refers to a plural group of investors within the larger group.\n* **Clause 2:** The subject is \"a few.\"  This refers to a smaller, specific group within the investors. \n\n**3. Applying Subject-Verb Agreement:**\n\n* **Clause 1:**  Since the subject \"many of whom\" is plural, the verb needs to be plural as well. Therefore, \"are\" is the correct choice.\n* **Clause 2:** The subject \"a few\" is also plural, but the context suggests we're talking about a small, specific group.  This is treated as singular in this context. Hence, \"is\" is the correct verb form.\n\n**4. Combining the Clauses:**\n\nThe correct answer is **(c) are / is** because it correctly applies the subject-verb agreement rules to both clauses.\n\n**Key Points for Subject-Verb Agreement with 'Many' and 'Few':**\n\n* **\"Many\" and \"Few\" are usually plural:**  When used as subjects, they generally require a plural verb. \n* **Context is important:**  Sometimes, \"a few\" can be treated as singular if it refers to a small, specific group. This is often the case when referring to individuals or items as a unit. \n\n**Additional Tips for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Practice Regularly:**  Subject-verb agreement questions are common in banking exams.  Practice with various sentence structures and different forms of \"many\" and \"few.\"\n* **Understand Pronoun Agreement:**  Pay attention to pronouns that relate to the subject.  Make sure they agree in number and person.\n* **Identify the True Subject:** Sometimes, the subject is hidden within a long phrase or clause.  Carefully identify the true subject before choosing the verb.\n\nBy mastering these concepts and practicing regularly, you can confidently answer subject-verb agreement questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Let's break down why:\n\n**Understanding Subject-Verb Agreement with 'All'**\n\nThe key to this question lies in understanding how \"all\" functions when it modifies a noun. \"All\" can act as a quantifier, indicating the entirety of a group. However, it doesn't always make the noun it modifies plural.\n\n**Here's how it works in this sentence:**\n\n* **\"The organizing committee... decided...\"**  - The subject is \"committee,\" a collective noun. Collective nouns are treated as singular when they act as a single unit, but they can also be plural if the focus is on the individual members. In this case, the focus is on the committee acting as a single unit, so we use the singular verb **\"has\"**.\n* **\"...all of the proposals submitted... none of them truly captured...\"** - \"All of the proposals\" modifies the committee, showing that they have considered every single proposal. This implies that the committee is acting as a group, so the verb becomes plural **\"have\"**.\n* **\"...none of them truly captured...\"**  -  \"None\" is a singular pronoun, but it refers to the plural noun \"proposals.\" This means the verb should be plural, **\"have\"**.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\n* The first verb is **\"have\"** because \"all of the proposals\" modifies the committee, indicating a collective action. \n* The second verb is **\"have\"** because \"none\" refers to the plural \"proposals\" even though it is a singular pronoun.\n\n**Important Note for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nSubject-verb agreement is a crucial topic for banking exams. These exams often feature questions that test your understanding of how singular and plural subjects and verbs work together. By practicing questions like this and understanding the nuances of \"all\" and other quantifiers, you can confidently tackle these grammar questions and achieve a higher score. \n",
