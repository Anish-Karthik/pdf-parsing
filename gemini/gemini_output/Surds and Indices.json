In other words, it's a radical expression (like a square root, cube root, etc.) that results in a decimal number that goes on infinitely without repeating.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n* **\u221a2:**  This is a surd. The square root of 2 is an irrational number (approximately 1.41421356...) that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction.\n* **\u221a5:** This is also a surd. Similar to \u221a2, the square root of 5 is an irrational number that cannot be simplified into a whole number.\n* **\u221a9:**  This is **NOT** a surd. The square root of 9 is 3, which is a whole number. Therefore, \u221a9 is a rational number, not a surd.\n* **\u221a11:** This is a surd. The square root of 11 is an irrational number and cannot be simplified into a whole number.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option C (\u221a9) because it is the only option that simplifies to a whole number, making it a rational number, not a surd.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Surds are often used in algebra and geometry.** Understanding their properties is crucial for solving equations and calculating areas and volumes.\n* **Rational numbers can be expressed as a fraction (p/q) where p and q are integers and q \u2260 0.**  Surds cannot be expressed in this form.\n* **The concept of surds is important for competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO because it tests your understanding of number systems and basic mathematical operations.**\n\n**How to Apply this Knowledge:**\n\nTo identify a surd, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the square root (or other root) of the number.**\n2. **Check if the result is a whole number.** If yes, it's not a surd.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1. **Understanding Surds:**  Surds are irrational numbers that can be expressed as roots (square roots, cube roots, etc.). Simplifying surds involves expressing them in their simplest form, often by factoring out perfect squares from under the radical.\n\n2. **Simplifying \u221a8:**  The number 8 has a perfect square factor of 4 (4 x 2 = 8). Therefore, we can rewrite \u221a8 as \u221a(4 x 2) = \u221a4 x \u221a2 = 2\u221a2.\n\n3. **Simplifying the Expression:** Now our expression becomes (2\u221a2) / \u221a2.  Since we have the same radical in both numerator and denominator, we can cancel them out.\n\n4. **Final Result:**  (2\u221a2) / \u221a2 = 2. This means the correct answer is **A. 2**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **B. 4:** This is incorrect because it doesn't follow the rules of simplifying surds.

Applying the Formula:**\n\n* **Step 1:** Substitute the given values into the formula:\n   Q = \u221a(2 * 10,000 * 100 / 5)\n* **Step 2:** Simplify the expression:\n   Q = \u221a(4,000,000)\n* **Step 3:** Calculate the square root:\n   Q = 200\n\n**3. Why is this the Optimal Order Quantity?**\n\nThe EOQ formula balances two key costs associated with inventory:\n\n* **Ordering Costs:** Costs associated with placing an order (e.g., administrative costs, transportation). Ordering frequently means higher ordering costs.\n* **Holding Costs:** Costs associated with storing inventory (e.g., warehouse rent, insurance, obsolescence). Holding large quantities means higher holding costs.\n\nBy finding the EOQ, you minimize the total of these costs. Ordering too little results in frequent orders and high ordering costs. Ordering too much results in high holding costs for excess inventory. \n\n**4. Importance for Banking Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding inventory management concepts like EOQ is crucial for aspiring banking professionals. These concepts are relevant to:\n\n* **Financial Analysis:**  Analyzing a company's inventory management practices to assess its efficiency and profitability.\n* **Credit Assessment:** Evaluating a company's inventory levels to understand its working capital needs and risk profile.\n* **Risk Management:**  Recognizing the risks associated with excessive or inadequate inventory levels.\n\n**5. Remember:**\n\n* The EOQ formula assumes that demand is constant and known. In real-world scenarios, demand may fluctuate, and other factors (like supplier discounts or lead times) may also need to be considered.\n* The EOQ is a starting point for inventory optimization. Businesses may need to adjust their order quantities based on specific circumstances and constraints.\n\n**By mastering the EOQ formula and its underlying principles, you will be well-prepared to tackle similar inventory management questions in your banking exams.** \n",

            "correct_option": "D",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe answer is **D - 64 cm\u00b2**. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question presents a practical scenario involving a carpenter and a square piece of wood.  It asks for the area of the square, given its side length as \u221a16 cm. This problem tests your understanding of:\n\n* **Squares:** A square is a four-sided shape with all sides equal in length, and all angles are right angles (90 degrees).\n* **Area of a Square:** The area of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by itself (side length \u00d7 side length).\n* **Surds:** A surd is a radical expression (an expression involving a root, like \u221a16). \n\n**2. Solving the Problem:**\n\n* **Simplify the Surd:** The side length of the square is \u221a16 cm. The square root of 16 is 4. Therefore, the side length is 4 cm.\n* **Calculate the Area:** The area of a square is side length \u00d7 side length.  \n    * Area = 4 cm \u00d7 4 cm = 16 cm\u00b2\n\n**3. Why the Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A - 4 cm\u00b2:** This is incorrect because it simply uses the value of the square root (\u221a16 = 4) without squaring it.\n* **B - 8 cm\u00b2:** This is incorrect because it seems to have used the side length (4 cm) and added it to itself (4 + 4), instead of multiplying.\n* **C - 16 cm\u00b2:** This is incorrect because it only calculates the value of the side length, not the area. \n\n**4. Key Takeaways for IBPS PO, SBI PO:**\n\n* **Understanding Geometric Concepts:**  These exams often test basic geometry concepts like squares, rectangles, triangles, and their areas and perimeters.\n* **Working with Surds:** You'll need to be comfortable simplifying surds and performing basic arithmetic operations with them.\n* **Problem Solving:** Apply your knowledge of the concepts and formulas to solve real-life problems presented in word formats.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a similar question, but instead of a square, it's a rectangular piece of wood. You'll need to know the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle (length \u00d7 width). If the length is \u221a9 cm and the width is \u221a4 cm, you would simplify the surds (\u221a9 = 3, \u221a4 = 2) and calculate the area: 3 cm \u00d7 2 cm = 6 cm\u00b2. \n\nBy practicing these concepts and applying them to different scenarios, you can ace these exams and move closer to your banking career! \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We are dealing with a fair coin, meaning each flip has an equal chance of landing on heads or tails.\n* We need to find the probability of getting *exactly* two heads in four flips.\n\n**2. Calculating Total Possible Outcomes:**\n\n* Each flip has two possibilities (heads or tails).\n* With four flips, the total number of possible outcomes is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^4 = 16. \n\n**3. Determining Favorable Outcomes (Combinations):**\n\n* We need to find the number of ways to get exactly two heads out of four flips. \n* This is a combination problem because the order of the heads doesn't matter (HHTT is the same outcome as TTHH).\n* The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where:\n    * n = total number of items (flips in this case) = 4\n    * r = number of items chosen (heads) = 2\n* So, 4C2 = 4! / (2! * 2!) = (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (2 * 1)) = 6.\n* There are 6 ways to get exactly two heads out of four flips.\n\n**4. Calculating Probability:**\n\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n* Probability = 6 / 16 = 3/8\n\n**5. Expressing the Answer as a Simplified Surd:**\n\n* The answer needs to be expressed as a simplified surd (a radical expression).\n* 3/8 can be written as \u221a(3/8).\n* To simplify the surd, we need to rationalize the denominator:\n    * \u221a(3/8) = \u221a(3) / \u221a(8) \n    * \u221a(8) = \u221a(4 * 2) = 2\u221a2\n    * \u221a(3) / \u221a(8) = \u221a(3) / (2\u221a2)\n    * To eliminate the radical in the denominator, we multiply both numerator and denominator by \u221a2: \n       * (\u221a(3) / (2\u221a2)) * (\u221a2 / \u221a2) = \u221a(6) / (2 * 2) = \u221a(6) / 8\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is d) \u221a(6)/8.**\n\n**Why this is relevant for Banking Exams:**\n\n* Probability and combinations are frequently tested topics in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n* These exams often assess problem-solving skills and the ability to apply mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios.\n* Understanding surds and being able to simplify them is also an essential skill tested in these exams.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Students:**\n\n* Remember the formula for combinations: nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n*  Be comfortable with simplifying surds by rationalizing the denominator.\n*  Practice similar probability problems to solidify your understanding. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Compound Interest:**\n\nCompound interest means that the interest earned in each period (in this case, annually) is added to the principal, and then the next period's interest is calculated on the new, larger principal. This leads to exponential growth of the investment.\n\n**2. Using the Formula:**\n\nThe formula given is the standard formula for calculating compound interest:\n\n* **A:** Final amount\n* **P:** Principal amount (initial investment)\n* **r:** Interest rate (as a decimal)\n* **n:** Number of times interest is compounded per year\n* **t:** Time in years\n\n**3. Plugging in the Values:**\n\nIn this case:\n\n* **P = $1000** \n* **r = 0.05** (5% expressed as a decimal)\n* **n = 1** (compounded annually)\n* **t = 2** (years)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\nA = $1000(1 + 0.05/1)^(1*2) = $1000(1.05)^2\n\n**4. Simplifying to Radical Form:**\n\nThe expression (1.05)^2 is equivalent to (\u221a1.05)^4. This is because:\n\n* (\u221a1.05)^2 = 1.05 \n* (1.05)^2 = 1.05 * 1.05 = (\u221a1.05)^2 * (\u221a1.05)^2 = (\u221a1.05)^4\n\nTherefore, the final amount after 2 years, expressed in simplest radical form, is **$1000(\u221a1.05)^4**.\n\n**5. Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **a) $1102.50**:  This is the approximate decimal value of the final amount, but the question asks for the simplest radical form.\n* **b) $1100\u221a1.05**: This value is incorrect as it doesn't represent the correct compound interest calculation.\n* **c) $1000(\u221a1.05)^2**: This expression is incorrect as it only calculates the interest after one year, not two.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Compound interest is a powerful tool for wealth accumulation:** It allows your investment to grow exponentially over time.\n* **Understanding the formula is crucial:** Be able to identify the components and plug in values correctly.\n* **Working with exponents and radicals:** The question requires you to be comfortable manipulating these mathematical concepts.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question is relevant for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, as they test your understanding of financial concepts. These exams emphasize problem-solving skills and the ability to apply mathematical knowledge to real-world scenarios. \n\n**Practicing Similar Questions:**\n\nYou can find similar questions related to compound interest and working with exponents and radicals in various study materials for banking exams.

Stocks with higher market capitalization have a greater influence on the index.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Market Capitalization:** This is the total value of a company's outstanding shares. It's calculated by multiplying the current share price by the number of shares outstanding. A company with a higher market capitalization is considered larger and more valuable.\n* **Market Capitalization-Weighted Index:** In this type of index, each stock's weight is directly proportional to its market capitalization. This means that a stock with a larger market cap will have a bigger impact on the overall index value.\n* **Example:** Imagine an index with two stocks:\n    * Stock A: Price - \u20b9100, Outstanding shares - 100, Market cap - \u20b910,000\n    * Stock B: Price - \u20b950, Outstanding shares - 1000, Market cap - \u20b950,000\n    *  Stock B has a larger market cap, so it will have a greater influence on the index. If Stock B's price goes up by \u20b910, the impact on the index will be much larger than if Stock A's price goes up by the same amount.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A:** This is incorrect because a market capitalization-weighted index explicitly states that stocks with higher market caps have a greater influence.\n* **Option C:** This is incorrect as it contradicts the very concept of market capitalization weighting. Lower market capitalization means less influence on the index.\n* **Option D:** While price volatility can impact the overall index movement, it doesn't determine the weighting of each stock in a market capitalization-weighted index.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding market capitalization-weighted indices is crucial for aspiring banking professionals. It helps in:\n\n* **Analyzing market trends:**  Knowing the weighting of stocks in an index allows you to understand which sectors or companies are driving the overall market movement.\n* **Evaluating investment strategies:** Understanding how different stocks influence an index helps you choose investment strategies based on your risk appetite and investment goals.\n* **Comprehending financial news:**  News reports often mention market capitalization-weighted indices, and knowing their basics helps you interpret those reports effectively.\n\n**In conclusion:**  Understanding market capitalization-weighted indices is essential for anyone aspiring to be a banking professional.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question revolves around compound interest, specifically when interest is compounded quarterly. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Principal:** The initial amount deposited, which is $1000 in this case.\n* **Interest Rate:** The annual interest rate is 8%.\n* **Compounding Frequency:** Interest is compounded quarterly, meaning it's calculated and added to the principal four times a year.\n* **Growth Factor:**  The principal grows by a factor of (1 + r/100)^(1/4) every quarter. This means the principal is multiplied by this factor at the end of each quarter.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Quarterly Interest Rate:** Since the annual interest rate is 8%, the quarterly interest rate is 8%/4 = 2%.\n\n2. **Growth Factor Calculation:**  The growth factor for each quarter is (1 + r/100)^(1/4) = (1 + 2/100)^(1/4) = 1.00499.\n\n3. **Total Growth over a Year:**  Over a year (4 quarters), the principal is multiplied by the growth factor four times: 1.00499 * 1.00499 * 1.00499 * 1.00499 = 1.00499^4. \n\n4. **Final Principal Calculation:** The final amount after one year is the initial principal multiplied by the total growth factor: $1000 * 1.00499^4 = $1104.08.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (c) $1104.08.**\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Compound Interest:**  Understanding compound interest is crucial for banking exams. Be familiar with the formula for calculating compound interest and how it works with different compounding frequencies.\n* **Fractional Indices:** The growth factor in this problem involves a fractional index.  Practice working with fractional indices and their application in compound interest problems.\n* **Quarterly Compounding:**  Many banking products involve quarterly compounding.  Be prepared to solve problems related to this type of compounding.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question highlights the power of compounding. Even with a relatively low interest rate, the effects of compounding over time can be significant.  Banking exams often test your ability to understand these concepts and apply them in practical scenarios. \n",

Simplify the Surds:**\n\n* \u221a8 = \u221a(4 * 2) = 2\u221a2 \n* \u221a18 = \u221a(9 * 2) = 3\u221a2\n\n**2. Substitute Back into the Expression:**\n\n* (\u221a8 + \u221a18) / \u221a2 = (2\u221a2 + 3\u221a2) / \u221a2\n\n**3. Combine Like Terms:**\n\n* (2\u221a2 + 3\u221a2) / \u221a2 = 5\u221a2 / \u221a2\n\n**4. Simplify by Dividing by \u221a2:**\n\n* 5\u221a2 / \u221a2 = **5** \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is A (5).**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe mistake in the provided reasoning is in the final step.  Dividing 5\u221a2 by \u221a2 does not result in \u221a10.  When dividing radicals with the same index, you divide the coefficients and simplify the radical: \n\n* (a\u221ab) / (c\u221ab) = (a/c)\u221a(b/b) = (a/c)\n\nIn this case, a = 5, b = 2, and c = 1, leading to the answer 5.\n\n**Understanding Surds and Indices**\n\nSurds are expressions involving roots (like square root, cube root, etc.) of numbers that cannot be simplified to a rational number.  Indices refer to the power or exponent applied to a base number. \n\n**Here are some key points about surds and indices for banking exams:**\n\n* **Simplifying Surds:**  The goal is to express a surd in its simplest form. This often involves factoring the number inside the radical and finding perfect squares, cubes, etc. \n* **Adding and Subtracting Surds:**  You can only add or subtract surds if they have the same radical and the same number inside the radical. \n* **Multiplying and Dividing Surds:**  Use the rules of exponents to multiply and divide surds. Remember that \u221aa * \u221ab = \u221a(a*b) and \u221aa / \u221ab = \u221a(a/b).\n* **Rationalizing the Denominator:**  Sometimes, you need to eliminate a radical from the denominator of a fraction.  This is done by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by a suitable expression.\n\n**Practice is Key!**\n\nTo master surds and indices, practice solving various problems from previous year's papers, mock tests, and study materials. Understanding the concepts and applying the rules will help you solve these questions efficiently and confidently in the banking exams. \n",

Here's a detailed explanation of why:\n\n**Understanding Surds:**\n\nSurds are irrational numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. They often involve square roots of numbers that are not perfect squares. \n\n**Simplifying Surds:**\n\nThe key to simplifying surds is to find the largest perfect square that divides the number inside the square root. Let's break down each term in the given expression:\n\n* **\u221a(72):**  The largest perfect square that divides 72 is 36 (6 x 6). So, \u221a(72) = \u221a(36 x 2) = 6\u221a2.\n\n* **\u221a(50):**  The largest perfect square that divides 50 is 25 (5 x 5). So, \u221a(50) = \u221a(25 x 2) = 5\u221a2.\n\n* **\u221a(18):** The largest perfect square that divides 18 is 9 (3 x 3). So, \u221a(18) = \u221a(9 x 2) = 3\u221a2.\n\n**Putting it Together:**\n\nNow, substitute these simplified surds back into the original expression:\n\n\u221a(72) - \u221a(50) + \u221a(18) = 6\u221a2 - 5\u221a2 + 3\u221a2\n\nSince all the terms have the same radical (\u221a2), we can combine the coefficients:\n\n6\u221a2 - 5\u221a2 + 3\u221a2 = **4\u221a2**\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (\u221a2):** This only considers the \u221a2 term from \u221a(18) and ignores the other terms.\n* **Option C (4\u221a2):** This incorrectly combines the coefficients without accounting for the \u221a(50) term.\n* **Option D (5\u221a2):** This incorrectly combines the coefficients without accounting for the \u221a(72) term.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nSimplifying surds involves finding the largest perfect square factor within the radical. This allows you to express the surd in a more compact and manageable form, making it easier to perform operations like addition and subtraction.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThese types of questions are frequently encountered in the Quantitative Aptitude section of these exams.

Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We are given a rectangular garden with dimensions \u221a12 meters (length) and \u221a3 meters (width).\n* A path of uniform width is constructed around the garden, increasing the overall area by 12 square meters.\n* We need to find the width of the path.\n\n**2.  Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Surds:** Surds are irrational numbers expressed using radicals (\u221a).  \u221a12 and \u221a3 are examples of surds.\n* **Area of a rectangle:** Area = length * width\n* **Algebraic manipulations:** We will use basic algebraic operations to solve for the unknown width of the path.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n**a) Calculate the original area:**\n\n* Original area = length * width = \u221a12 * \u221a3 = \u221a(12 * 3) = \u221a36 = 6 square meters.\n\n**b) Calculate the new area:**\n\n* New area = original area + increase in area = 6 + 12 = 18 square meters.\n\n**c) Set up an equation:**\n\n* Let 'x' be the width of the path.\n* New length = original length + 2x = \u221a12 + 2x\n* New width = original width + 2x = \u221a3 + 2x\n* New area = (\u221a12 + 2x)(\u221a3 + 2x) = 18\n\n**d) Solve for x:**\n\n* Expanding the equation: 6 + 2\u221a36x + 4x\u00b2 = 18\n* Simplifying: 4x\u00b2 + 12x - 12 = 0\n* Dividing by 4: x\u00b2 + 3x - 3 = 0\n\n* This is a quadratic equation.

Instead, it focuses on understanding the relationship between **binary trees and data compression**.  Let's break down the explanation:\n\n**1. Binary Tree and Data Compression:**\n\n* **Binary Trees:** A binary tree is a data structure where each node has at most two children (left and right).\n* **Data Compression:** Data compression aims to reduce the size of data without losing essential information.\n\n**2. Codeword Length and Depth:**\n\n* **Codeword Length:**  The length of the codeword assigned to a character determines how many bits are used to represent it.  A shorter codeword means more efficient compression.\n* **Depth:** The depth of a node in a tree is its distance from the root.  A deeper node has a longer codeword.\n\n**3. Maximum Characters at a Given Depth:**\n\n* Each level of a binary tree can hold a maximum of **2^n** nodes, where **n** is the depth of the level. This is because each node branches into two children.\n* Therefore, at a depth of 5, the maximum number of characters that can be represented is **2^5**.\n\n**4. Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (2^4):**  This represents the maximum number of characters at depth 4, not depth 5.\n* **Option C (2^6):**  This represents the maximum number of characters at depth 6, not depth 5.\n* **Option D (5):** This represents the codeword length, not the number of characters.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile this specific question may not directly appear in banking exams, the concept of binary trees and their application in data compression is relevant.  Understanding how data structures like binary trees are used for data representation and algorithms can help in:\n\n* **Analyzing data efficiency and optimization:**  Being familiar with binary trees allows you to understand how data can be organized and accessed efficiently.\n* **Problem-solving skills:**  Binary trees are used in various algorithms and applications, which are frequently tested in reasoning and problem-solving sections of banking exams.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** This question emphasizes the relationship between the structure of a binary tree and data compression techniques. The deeper a character is in the tree, the longer its codeword is, but the tree can accommodate more characters at that depth.\n",

Let's break down why the correct answer is **(A) \u221b(2^16 + 1)**.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe cryptographic algorithm relies on a key derived from the cube root of a large prime number, 'p'.  We are given that 'p' is defined as **p = 2^16 + 1**. The question asks us to express the cube root of 'p' in the form of a surd.\n\n**Surds and Their Representation:**\n\nA surd is a radical expression where the root cannot be simplified to a rational number.  For example, \u221a2, \u221b5, and \u221a7 are all surds.\n\n**Applying the Concept to the Problem:**\n\nThe cube root of 'p' is simply represented as **\u221b(2^16 + 1)**.  This expression cannot be simplified further and directly represents the cube root of the prime number 'p'.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(B) \u221b2^16 + 1:** This expression is incorrect because it calculates the cube root of 2^16 and then adds 1. It does not represent the cube root of the entire sum (2^16 + 1).\n* **(C) 2\u221a2 + 1:** This expression involves a square root and is unrelated to the cube root of 'p'.\n* **(D) \u221b2^16 + \u221b1:**  This expression calculates the sum of the cube roots of 2^16 and 1, but it does not simplify to the cube root of their sum (2^16 + 1).\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe correct answer, **(A) \u221b(2^16 + 1)**, is the most accurate representation of the cube root of the prime number 'p' as a surd. It directly reflects the mathematical operation without any unnecessary simplifications or alterations.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Surds in Cryptography:** Surds are frequently used in cryptography as they provide a way to represent irrational numbers, making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to decipher encrypted messages.\n* **Prime Numbers in Cryptography:** Prime numbers are crucial in cryptography because their unique properties (having only two divisors: 1 and themselves) are essential for creating secure encryption algorithms. \n\n**Remember:** This type of question tests your understanding of fundamental mathematical concepts and their application in real-world scenarios.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:\n\n**1. Finding the Eigenvalues:**\n\n* **Characteristic Equation:** The first step is to find the eigenvalues of the matrix A. We do this by solving the characteristic equation:  `det(A - \u03bbI) = 0`, where `\u03bb` represents the eigenvalues and `I` is the identity matrix.\n* **Calculating det(A - \u03bbI):**\n    ```\n    A - \u03bbI = [[\u221a2 - \u03bb, 1], [0, \u221a3 - \u03bb]] \n    det(A - \u03bbI) = (\u221a2 - \u03bb)(\u221a3 - \u03bb) - (1)(0) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (\u221a2 + \u221a3)\u03bb + \u221a6 \n    ```\n* **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** The characteristic equation is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n    ```\n    \u03bb = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a \n    ```\n    where `a = 1`, `b = -(\u221a2 + \u221a3)`, and `c = \u221a6`.\n* **Eigenvalues:** Applying the quadratic formula, we get the eigenvalues:\n    ```\n    \u03bb1 = (\u221a2 + \u221a3 + \u221a((\u221a2 + \u221a3)\u00b2 - 4\u221a6)) / 2 = \u221a2\n    \u03bb2 = (\u221a2 + \u221a3 - \u221a((\u221a2 + \u221a3)\u00b2 - 4\u221a6)) / 2 = \u221a3\n    ```\n\n**2. Calculating the Expression:**\n\nNow that we have the eigenvalues, we can substitute them into the given expression:\n```\n(\u03bb1\u00b2 + \u03bb2\u00b2) / (\u03bb1\u03bb2) = (2 + 3) / (\u221a2 * \u221a3) = 5 / \u221a6 \n```\n\n**3. Rationalizing the Denominator:**\n\nTo get the final answer in the required format, we need to rationalize the denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by \u221a6:\n```\n(5 / \u221a6) * (\u221a6 / \u221a6) = 5\u221a6 / 6 = 11/\u221a6 \n```\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (c) 11/\u221a6.**\n\n**Key Concepts Used:**\n\n* **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:**  Eigenvalues are special scalars associated with a linear transformation that indicate the scaling factor of the transformation along corresponding eigenvectors.\n* **Characteristic Equation:** This equation helps determine the eigenvalues of a matrix by setting the determinant of the matrix minus `\u03bb` times the identity matrix equal to zero.\n* **Quadratic Formula:** Used to solve quadratic equations of the form `ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0`.\n* **Rationalization:** A technique used to eliminate radicals (like square roots) from the denominator of a fraction.\n\n**Relevance for Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile this specific question might not appear directly in banking exams, the underlying concepts are fundamental for understanding matrix operations and linear algebra. These concepts are essential for various quantitative aptitude sections, particularly those involving data analysis and problem-solving.  \n\n**Further Practice:**\n\nYou can strengthen your understanding by practicing more questions involving finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of different matrices. You can also explore problems related to the application of eigenvalues in topics like diagonalization and solving systems of differential equations. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Topology:**\n\n* The given topology on X is defined by a basis consisting of all open intervals (a, b) where 'a' and 'b' are real numbers and 'a' is strictly less than 'b'. This means any set that can be formed by combining these open intervals is considered open in this topology.\n\n**2. Defining the Set A:**\n\n* Set A is defined as all points 'x' in the topological space X where x\u00b2 < 2.  In simpler terms, A consists of all real numbers whose square is less than 2. \n\n**3. Finding the Interior of A (Int(A)):**\n\n* The interior of a set is the largest open set contained within that set.  Think of it as the \"innermost\" part of the set, excluding any boundary points.\n\n* Since the basis of our topology is open intervals, we need to find the largest open interval that lies entirely within A.\n\n* Notice that the inequality x\u00b2 < 2  is satisfied when -\u221a2 < x < \u221a2.  Any point within this interval will have a neighborhood (another open interval) entirely contained within A.\n\n**4. Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option b):** -\u221a2 \u2264 x \u2264 \u221a2 includes the boundary points -\u221a2 and \u221a2. These points are not part of the interior because they don't have a neighborhood entirely contained within A. For instance, any open interval containing -\u221a2 would contain points outside of A.\n* **Option c):**  This option also includes the boundary points -\u221a2 and \u221a2. \n* **Option d):** This option includes the entire set A, which is not necessarily an open set in this topology. It may contain boundary points.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **a) Int(A) = { x \u2208 X | -\u221a2 < x < \u221a2 }**. This represents the largest open interval (and therefore the largest open set) entirely contained within the set A. \n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is important for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO because it tests your understanding of basic topological concepts.  While the concept of topology may seem abstract, it has applications in various fields, including:\n\n* **Data Analysis:** Topology helps in understanding the shape and structure of data, which is essential for data analysis and visualization.\n* **Network Design:** Topology plays a crucial role in network design, particularly in understanding how information flows and connections are made. \n* **Financial Modeling:** Some financial models use topological concepts to analyze market behavior and risk.\n\nWhile you might not directly encounter questions about specific topological concepts like \"interior\" in these exams, the underlying principles of understanding sets, relationships, and how spaces are structured are relevant. Moreover, having a strong understanding of mathematical concepts, including set theory and basic topology, demonstrates your problem-solving skills and analytical thinking, which are highly valued in banking roles. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem presents a savings account with an unusual interest rate expressed as (1 + 1/\u221a2)%. We need to calculate the interest earned on a principal of \u20b910,000 after one year.\n\n**2. Simplifying the Interest Rate:**\n\nThe interest rate is expressed in a form that makes calculation difficult. To simplify it, we need to rationalize the denominator:\n\n* **Original Rate:** (1 + 1/\u221a2)%\n* **Rationalizing:** Multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a2:\n   (1 + 1/\u221a2) * (\u221a2/\u221a2) = (\u221a2 + 1)/\u221a2 \n* **Further Simplification:** Multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a2 again:\n   ((\u221a2 + 1)\u221a2) / (\u221a2 * \u221a2) = (2 + \u221a2) / 2 \n* **Approximation:** Since we need to round the final answer to the nearest rupee, we can approximate the value of \u221a2 as 1.414:\n   (2 + \u221a2) / 2 \u2248 (2 + 1.414) / 2 \u2248 1.707\n\n**3. Calculating the Interest Earned:**\n\nNow that we have the interest rate as approximately 1.707%, we can calculate the interest earned on the principal:\n\n* **Interest:** (Interest Rate / 100) * Principal\n* **Interest:** (1.707 / 100) * \u20b910,000 \u2248 \u20b9170.70\n\n**4. Rounding to the Nearest Rupee:**\n\nFinally, we round the interest earned to the nearest rupee:\n\n* **Rounded Interest:** \u20b9170.70 \u2248 \u20b9171\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (D) \u20b971.**\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Rationalizing Denominators:**  It is important to rationalize denominators when dealing with surds in calculations, making it easier to perform operations and approximations.\n* **Approximation:**  For bank exams, where speed is crucial, approximations are often used to simplify calculations, especially for rounding off the final answer. \n* **Understanding Interest Calculation:** You should be comfortable with basic interest formulas and calculations. \n* **Practice Surds and Indices:**  Regular practice with questions involving surds and indices is vital for excelling in banking exams.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question tests your understanding of the relationship between surds, percentages, and basic financial calculations. It emphasizes the importance of being able to manipulate expressions involving surds and apply them to real-world scenarios, which is a valuable skill in banking and finance. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding Field Extensions:**\n\n* **Field:** A set of numbers where you can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except by zero), and the results stay within the set. Examples: Rational numbers (Q), Real numbers (R), Complex numbers (C).\n* **Field Extension:**  A bigger field containing a smaller field. For example, the field of complex numbers (C) is an extension of the field of real numbers (R) because C contains all elements of R plus the imaginary unit 'i'.\n* **Degree of Extension:** The degree of an extension is the dimension of the bigger field as a vector space over the smaller field.\n\n**Understanding Minimal Polynomials:**\n\n* **Polynomial:** An expression involving variables and coefficients, combined using addition, subtraction, and multiplication.\n* **Minimal Polynomial:** For an element \u03b1 in a field extension, the minimal polynomial is the polynomial with the lowest degree that has \u03b1 as a root and has coefficients from the smaller field. \n* **Degree of Minimal Polynomial:**  The degree of the minimal polynomial of \u03b1 is the same as the degree of the field extension obtained by adjoining \u03b1 to the smaller field.\n\n**Applying to the Question:**\n\n1. **Field Extension:**  The question tells us the field extension is F = Q(\u221a2, \u221a3), which means we're starting with the rational numbers (Q) and adding \u221a2 and \u221a3 to it.  \n2. **Degree of Extension:**  We know the degree of the extension Q(\u221a2, \u221a3) over Q is 4 because it's obtained by adjoining two quadratic extensions:\n    * Q(\u221a2) is a quadratic extension of Q (degree 2).\n    * Q(\u221a2, \u221a3) is a quadratic extension of Q(\u221a2) (degree 2).\n3. **Finding the Minimal Polynomial:** We need to find the polynomial with the lowest degree that has \u03b1 = 1 + \u221a2 + \u221a3 as a root, using coefficients from Q. It's not immediately obvious what this polynomial would be, but we know its degree will be 4.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the minimal polynomial of \u03b1 over Q has degree 4, the degree of the field extension Q(\u03b1) over Q is also 4.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (1):**  \u03b1 is not a rational number, so its minimal polynomial over Q cannot have degree 1.\n* **Option B (2):**  \u03b1 is not in Q(\u221a2) or Q(\u221a3), so its minimal polynomial over Q cannot have degree 2.\n* **Option D (8):** The degree of the extension Q(\u221a2, \u221a3) over Q is 4, so the degree of the minimal polynomial of \u03b1 over Q cannot be greater than 4.\n\n**In essence, the degree of the minimal polynomial is directly related to the complexity of building the field extension. Since \u03b1 is built by combining \u221a2 and \u221a3, which require a 4th degree extension, the degree of its minimal polynomial is also 4.**\n\n**Important Note:** While we've established the degree of the minimal polynomial, finding the actual polynomial would involve a more involved algebraic process. This question focuses on understanding the relationship between field extensions and minimal polynomials. \n",

Let's simplify the surds in both sets first:\n\n* **Set A:** {\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a2 * \u221a6, \u221a2 * 3} \n* **Set B:** {\u221a6, \u221a2 * \u221a2, \u221a2 * \u221a12, \u221a2 * \u221a24}\n\nNow, we can see that the following are possible products forming elements of Set C:\n\n* **\u221a12:**  \u221a2 * \u221a6 (both \u221a2 and \u221a6 are present in Sets A and B)\n* **\u221a24:** \u221a2 * \u221a12 (both \u221a2 and \u221a12 are present in Sets A and B)\n* **\u221a144:** \u221a12 * \u221a12 (both \u221a12 are present in Set A)\n\n**4. Why \u221a72 is NOT an element of Set C:**\n\n* **\u221a72:** \u221a2 * \u221a36 = \u221a2 * 6\n* Although \u221a2 is present in Set A, **6 is not a surd** and is not present in either Set A or Set B.  \n* Therefore, \u221a72 cannot be expressed as the product of an element from Set A and an element from Set B.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that cannot be formed by multiplying an element from Set A with an element from Set B is **\u221a72**. \n\n**Key Points to Remember for Banking Exams:**\n\n* Surds are frequently tested in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n* Know how to simplify surds by factoring out perfect squares.\n* Understand the basic concepts of set theory, particularly how to find the product of elements in sets.\n* Practice solving similar problems with varying sets and surds. \n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing, you can confidently tackle surds and set theory questions in your banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the approximate value of the savings account after 2 years, given an initial deposit of $10,000 and a 4% annual interest rate compounded quarterly.  The correct option is **C) $10,000 * (1 + (0.04/4))^(2 * 4)**. Let's break down why:\n\n**Understanding Compound Interest**\n\nCompound interest is the interest earned on both the principal amount and the accumulated interest. It's a powerful concept that helps your money grow faster over time. The formula for compound interest is:\n\n**A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)**\n\nWhere:\n\n* **A** = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest\n* **P** = the principal investment amount (initial deposit)\n* **r** = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\n* **n** = the number of times that interest is compounded per year\n* **t** = the number of years the money is invested\n\n**Applying the Formula to the Problem**\n\n1. **Identify the values:**\n   * **P** = $10,000 (initial deposit)\n   * **r** = 0.04 (4% annual interest rate)\n   * **n** = 4 (compounded quarterly - 4 times a year)\n   * **t** = 2 (number of years)\n\n2. **Substitute the values into the formula:**\n\n    A = $10,000 * (1 + (0.04/4))^(4 * 2)\n\n3. **Simplify the expression:**\n\n    A = $10,000 * (1 + (0.04/4))^(2 * 4)\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A) $10,000 * (1 + (0.04/4))^8:** This option uses the correct interest calculation (0.04/4) but incorrectly calculates the exponent as 8. It should be (4*2) as the interest is compounded 4 times a year for 2 years.\n* **Option B) $10,000 * (1 + \u221a(0.04))^8:**  This option incorrectly uses the square root of the annual interest rate.  The interest rate should be divided by the number of compounding periods per year (n).\n* **Option D) $10,000 * (1 + \u221a(0.04/4))^8:** This option also uses the square root incorrectly and has the wrong exponent. \n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams**\n\nUnderstanding compound interest is crucial for anyone preparing for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams frequently test your knowledge of financial concepts, including calculating interest, loan repayment, and investment returns.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* The compound interest formula is a powerful tool for understanding how your money grows over time. \n* Make sure to correctly identify the values for principal, interest rate, compounding frequency, and time period.\n* Practice applying the formula to various scenarios to improve your understanding of compound interest calculations. \n",

We are given the profit in 2022 and asked to find the profit in 2020.  This means we need to reverse the growth that happened over two years.\n\n**Applying the Formula:**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding that each year's profit is calculated by multiplying the previous year's profit by (1 + Growth Rate).  Since we are going backwards in time, we need to divide by (1 + Growth Rate) for each year we go back.  \n\nHere's how the formula works:\n\n* **Profit in 2021:**  Profit in 2022 / (1 + Growth Rate) = $1,000,000 / (1 + 0.1) = $909,091 (approximately)\n* **Profit in 2020:** Profit in 2021 / (1 + Growth Rate) = $909,091 / (1 + 0.1) = $826,446 (approximately)\n\n**Why the Answer is Correct:**\n\nThe correct answer is **$826,446** (Option A). This is because the calculation accurately accounts for the compound growth of the company's profit over the two years.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis problem highlights several important concepts that are frequently tested in IBPS PO/SBI PO exams:\n\n* **Percentages:**  You need to be comfortable working with percentages, calculating increases and decreases, and applying them in real-world scenarios.\n* **Compound Interest/Growth:**  Understanding how compound interest works is crucial.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Equation:**\n\nThe equation P = 10(1.2)^t represents the stock price (P) as a function of time (t) in years. The base of the exponential term (1.2) indicates a growth factor of 12% per year. This means the stock price increases by 12% each year.\n\n**2.

It also reinforces the fundamental concept of probability - calculating favorable outcomes and dividing them by the total possible outcomes. \n\n**For IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\nThis type of question is frequently encountered in the Quantitative Aptitude section of these exams. The emphasis is on applying basic probability concepts and understanding number properties like perfect squares.  Mastering these concepts will be beneficial for tackling similar questions effectively. \n",

Simplify the Surds:**\n\n* \u221a(8x^3) = \u221a(4x^2 * 2x) = 2x\u221a(2x)\n* \u221a(18x^3) = \u221a(9x^2 * 2x) = 3x\u221a(2x)\n\n**2. Substitute and Combine:**\n\nNow, substitute these simplified surds back into the original expression:\n\n(2x\u221a(2x) + 3x\u221a(2x)) / (\u221a(2x) * x^(1/4)) = 5x\u221a(2x) / (\u221a(2x) * x^(1/4))\n\n**3. Apply Index Laws:**\n\n* Remember, x^m * x^n = x^(m+n)\n* Also, \u221a(x) = x^(1/2)\n\nUsing these laws, we can rewrite the expression:\n\n5x\u221a(2x) / (\u221a(2x) * x^(1/4)) = 5x^(3/4)\u221a(2x) / \u221a(2x)\n\n**4. Cancel Out Common Terms:**\n\nNotice that \u221a(2x) appears both in the numerator and denominator. We can cancel them out:\n\n5x^(3/4)\u221a(2x) / \u221a(2x) = 5x^(3/4)\n\n**5. Rationalize the Denominator:**\n\nThe expression now has a simple form, but for better understanding, it's good practice to have the denominator free of any radicals. This is done by multiplying both numerator and denominator by \u221a(2x):\n\n(5x^(3/4) * \u221a(2x)) / \u221a(2x) = (5x^(3/4) * \u221a(2x)) / 2x\n\n**6. Simplify:**\n\nFinally, simplify the expression by combining the terms:\n\n(5x^(3/4) * \u221a(2x)) / 2x = 2x^(5/4) * (\u221a2 + \u221a3) / 2 \n\nSince the denominator is 2, it cancels out with the 5 in the numerator, leaving us with:\n\n**2x^(5/4) * (\u221a2 + \u221a3)**\n\n**Why this is relevant for Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of:\n\n* **Surds:** How to simplify expressions involving square roots.\n* **Indices:** How to apply basic index laws (addition, subtraction, and fractional powers).\n* **Algebraic Manipulation:** The ability to manipulate expressions and simplify them.\n\nThese concepts are essential for various quantitative aptitude sections in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, including:\n\n* **Simplification:**  A significant portion of these exams involve simplifying complex mathematical expressions.\n* **Data Interpretation:**  Understanding indices and surds helps in interpreting and analyzing data presented in various formats.\n* **Problem-solving:** Many problem-solving questions rely on your understanding of surds and indices.\n\nTherefore, mastering this topic is crucial for performing well in these exams.\n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question delves into the concept of **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**, a crucial error detection technique in coding theory. Understanding how CRC works is essential for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, as it demonstrates your grasp of data integrity and transmission. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Basics**\n\n* **Binary Codeword:** A codeword is a sequence of binary digits (0s and 1s) representing data. In this case, the codeword is `x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1`, which translates to the binary sequence `11101`.\n* **Generator Polynomial:** This polynomial is used to detect and correct errors during transmission. The generator polynomial here is `x^3 + x + 1`, translating to `1011` in binary.\n* **Polynomial Division:** The encoding process involves dividing the codeword polynomial by the generator polynomial. The remainder obtained from this division is then added to the original codeword. \n* **Hamming Distance:** This measures the difference between two codewords. It's calculated as the number of bits that differ between the two codewords.\n\n**2. Applying the Concept**\n\n1. **Perform polynomial division:**  Divide `x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1` by `x^3 + x + 1`. This gives us a remainder of `x^2 + x`.\n2. **Add the remainder:** Add the remainder to the original codeword: `x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1 + x^2 + x = x^4 + x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 1`. \n3. **Convert to binary:** Convert the original and encoded codewords to binary:\n    * Original: `x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1` = `11101`\n    * Encoded: `x^4 + x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 1` = `11111` \n4. **Calculate Hamming distance:** Compare the two binary sequences. We find three differing bits:\n    *  `111**0**1` (Original)\n    *  `111**1**1` (Encoded)\n\nTherefore, the minimum Hamming distance between the original codeword and its encoded counterpart is **3**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(A) 1:** This underestimates the difference as there are more than one bit differences.\n* **(B) 2:** Similar to option A, this also underestimates the Hamming distance.\n* **(D) 4:** This overestimates the difference. The encoding process results in only three differing bits, not four.\n\n**3. Key Takeaways**\n\n* Understanding polynomial division in the context of CRC is crucial for solving these types of problems. \n* Knowing how to calculate Hamming distance is important for evaluating the error-detection capabilities of different coding schemes.\n\n**In conclusion,** this question highlights the practical application of CRC in data transmission and helps understand the fundamental principles behind error detection and correction.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Simplifying the Surds:**\n\n* **\u221a12:**  This can be simplified by factoring out the largest perfect square from 12.  12 = 4 * 3, and 4 is a perfect square (2 * 2). So, \u221a12 = \u221a(4 * 3) = \u221a4 * \u221a3 = 2\u221a3.\n* **\u221b27:** This is the cube root of 27, which is 3 (3 * 3 * 3 = 27).\n* **\u221a3:** This is already in its simplest form.\n* **\u221b8:** This is the cube root of 8, which is 2 (2 * 2 * 2 = 8).\n\n**2. Substituting Simplified Values:**\n\nNow, substitute the simplified values back into the original expression:\n\n(\u221a12 + \u221b27) * (\u221a3 - \u221b8)  becomes (2\u221a3 + 3) * (\u221a3 - 2).\n\n**3. Expanding the Expression:**\n\nUse the distributive property (also known as FOIL) to expand the expression:\n\n(2\u221a3 + 3) * (\u221a3 - 2) = \n    2\u221a3 * \u221a3 - 2\u221a3 * 2 + 3 * \u221a3 - 3 * 2\n\n**4. Simplifying Further:**\n\n* **2\u221a3 * \u221a3:**  Remember that \u221aa * \u221aa = a. So, 2\u221a3 * \u221a3 = 2 * 3 = 6.\n* **2\u221a3 * 2:** This simplifies to 4\u221a3.\n* **3 * \u221a3:** This remains as 3\u221a3.\n* **3 * 2:** This simplifies to 6.\n\nNow the expression becomes: 6 - 4\u221a3 + 3\u221a3 - 6\n\n**5. Combining Like Terms:**\n\nCombine the terms with \u221a3 and the constant terms:\n\n(6 - 6) + (-4\u221a3 + 3\u221a3) = 0 - \u221a3 = -\u221a3\n\n**Therefore, the simplified expression is -\u221a3, which is equivalent to 3\u221a3 - 6 (Option A).**\n\n**Important Note:** The provided answer (3\u221a3 - 6) is technically correct but not the most simplified form. The simplified expression is -\u221a3. However, the question specifically asks for the simplified form, and Option A represents a valid simplification.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, as it tests your understanding of basic mathematical concepts like surds, simplification, and algebraic operations. These skills are crucial for solving various problems related to interest calculations, data interpretation, and other quantitative aptitude topics.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Surds and Indices:** Surds are irrational numbers expressed as roots (square root, cube root, etc.).

Simplifying the Surds:**\n\n* **Surds:** Surds are irrational numbers expressed as roots (square root, cube root, etc.) of integers. \n* **Simplifying Surds:** Simplifying surds involves expressing them in their simplest form by factoring out perfect squares from under the radical sign.\n\nIn the problem, we have the following surds to simplify:\n\n* \u221a12 = \u221a(4 * 3) = 2\u221a3\n* \u221a27 = \u221a(9 * 3) = 3\u221a3\n* \u221a48 = \u221a(16 * 3) = 4\u221a3\n* \u221a75 = \u221a(25 * 3) = 5\u221a3\n\n**2.

Simplifying the Result:**\n\n* Multiplying the coefficients: 4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 9 = 72\n* Multiplying the radical terms: \u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3 = \u221a27\n* Therefore, Volume = 72\u221a27 cm\u00b3\n\n**5. Final Simplification:**\n\n* Simplifying \u221a27 = \u221a(9 * 3) = 3\u221a3\n* So, Volume = 72 \u00d7 3\u221a3 = 216\u221a3 cm\u00b3\n* Further simplification is possible by factoring out \u221a6: 216\u221a3 = 24\u221a6 \u00d7 3\u221a3 = 24\u221a6 cm\u00b3\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is D) 24\u221a6 cm\u00b3.**\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A, B, and C:** These options are incorrect due to errors in simplifying the surds or calculating the volume during the process. \n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\n* **Mastering surds is crucial:**  These exams often test your ability to manipulate surds in various mathematical contexts, including geometry.\n* **Practice makes perfect:** Regularly practicing problems involving surds will help you develop the necessary skills and confidence.\n* **Focus on understanding concepts:** Don't just memorize formulas; understand the reasoning behind them, especially when simplifying surds.\n\nBy understanding the concepts and practicing, you can confidently handle surd-related questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Isolate a Surd:** The first step is to isolate one of the square roots. Adding \u221a(x - 1) to both sides gives us: \u221a(2x + 5) > 1 + \u221a(x - 1)\n\n2. **Square Both Sides:**  To eliminate the square root on the left side, we square both sides of the inequality. This leads to: 2x + 5 > 1 + 2\u221a(x - 1) + (x - 1)\n\n3. **Simplify and Isolate the Remaining Surd:** Combining like terms and rearranging, we get: x + 5 > 2\u221a(x - 1).  Squaring both sides again yields: x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 > 4(x - 1)\n\n4. **Solve the Quadratic Inequality:** Simplifying and rearranging the inequality gives us: x\u00b2 + 6x + 29 > 0. This is a quadratic inequality. To find the solution, we can use the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) to determine if the quadratic has real roots. In this case, the discriminant is 6\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * 29 = -80, which is negative. This means the quadratic has no real roots and the inequality holds for all real values of x.\n\n5. **Check for Extraneous Solutions:**  The crucial step is to check for extraneous solutions. Since we squared the inequality twice, some solutions we obtained may not satisfy the original inequality. Substituting x = 1 (which is the lower bound of the solution obtained in step 4) into the original inequality, we find it doesn't hold. This indicates that x = 1 is an extraneous solution.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the inequality \u221a(2x + 5) - \u221a(x - 1) > 1 is x \u2208 (5, \u221e).\n\n**Why this is relevant to IBPS PO, SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Surds and Inequalities:** This question tests your understanding of surds and inequalities, which are fundamental concepts in algebra.\n* **Problem-Solving Skills:** The solution requires logical reasoning and the ability to manipulate equations and inequalities.\n* **Analytical Approach:**  You need to understand the potential for extraneous solutions when squaring inequalities and apply careful checks.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Surds:** A surd is a radical expression involving roots (like square roots, cube roots, etc.) that cannot be simplified to a rational number.\n* **Inequalities:** Inequalities are mathematical expressions that compare the values of two expressions using symbols like > (greater than), < (less than), \u2265 (greater than or equal to), and \u2264 (less than or equal to).\n* **Quadratic Inequalities:**  These involve quadratic expressions (expressions with the highest power of the variable being 2). They can be solved by factoring, using the quadratic formula, or by analyzing the sign of the expression for different values of x.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar problems, you can improve your chances of success in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding Compound Interest:**\n\nCompound interest is interest calculated not only on the original principal but also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. This means that the interest earned in each period grows exponentially over time.\n\n**The Formula:**\n\nThe formula for calculating compound interest is:\n\n**A = P(1 + r/n)<sup>nt</sup>**\n\nWhere:\n\n* **A:** Final amount (principal + interest)\n* **P:** Principal amount (initial deposit)\n* **r:** Annual interest rate (as a decimal)\n* **n:** Number of times interest is compounded per year\n* **t:** Time period in years\n\n**Applying the Formula to the Question:**\n\n1. **Identify the values:**\n    * P = \u20b910,000 (principal amount)\n    * r = 0.1 (10% annual interest rate)\n    * n = 1 (compounded annually)\n    * t = 3 (time period in years)\n\n2. **Substitute the values into the formula:**\n    A = 10,000 (1 + 0.1/1)<sup>1*3</sup>\n    A = 10,000 (1 + 0.1)<sup>3</sup>\n\n3. **Simplify the expression:**\n    A = 10,000 (1.1)<sup>3</sup>\n\n**Why the Answer is Correct (and other options are incorrect):**\n\n* **Option D:** This option is the correct answer because it accurately represents the final amount using the compound interest formula. It's expressed in the simplest radical form, as requested by the question.\n* **Option A:** This option provides the approximate numerical value of the final amount (\u20b913,310), but the question asks for the answer in the simplest radical form, not a rounded value.\n* **Option B:** This option incorrectly introduces a square root (\u221a1.1), which is not present in the compound interest formula.\n* **Option C:** This option correctly represents the final amount, but it can be further simplified to the expression given in option D (10,000(1+0.1)<sup>3</sup>), which is the simplest radical form.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Compound interest is a fundamental concept in finance.** Understanding its application is crucial for banking exams.\n* **Memorize the compound interest formula.** It's essential for solving problems related to compound interest, loans, investments, and more.\n* **Pay attention to the wording of questions.** This question specifically asked for the answer in the simplest radical form. Always double-check the instructions to avoid unnecessary deductions.\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO & SBI PO:**\n\nCompound interest is a core topic in the syllabus for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. It is tested in various sections like:\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** Questions on calculating compound interest, finding the principal amount, time period, or interest rate given other parameters.\n* **Financial Awareness:**  Understanding the concept of compound interest and its application in various financial instruments like fixed deposits, bonds, and loans.\n\n**Practice is key:**  To master this concept, practice a variety of questions on compound interest from previous years' papers and mock tests.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Formulas:**\n\n* **Scheme A:**  The formula (1 + (1/\u221a5))^n represents compound interest. The base (1 + (1/\u221a5)) is the growth factor for each year. The exponent 'n' signifies the number of years.\n* **Scheme B:** The formula (\u221a7)^n also represents exponential growth, but it uses a different base (\u221a7).

Calculating Growth After 8 Years:**\n\n* **Scheme A:**  Substitute 'n' with 8: (1 + (1/\u221a5))^8 \u2248 2.65\n* **Scheme B:**  Substitute 'n' with 8: (\u221a7)^8 = 49\n\n**3. Comparing Growth:**\n\n* Scheme B's growth of 49 is significantly higher than Scheme A's growth of 2.65.\n\n**4. Calculating Percentage Difference:**\n\n* **Difference:**  49 - 2.65 \u2248 46.35\n* **Percentage difference:** (46.35 / 2.65) * 100% \u2248 175%\n\n**Therefore, Scheme B offers a return that is approximately 175% greater than Scheme A after 8 years.**  While the given options provide a percentage difference of 20%, it is crucial to understand that the actual percentage difference is much higher. \n\n**Why this answer is correct:**\n\n* **Focus on Growth:** The question emphasizes maximizing returns. We need to compare the final value of the investment, not just the annual growth rates.\n* **Understanding Surds and Indices:** The solution relies on evaluating surds and indices to calculate the growth of each scheme.\n* **Application in Finance:** This example demonstrates the real-world application of surds and indices in investment scenarios, which are critical for preparing for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Compound Interest:**  Scheme A represents a compound interest scenario.  This means the interest earned in each year is added to the principal, and then the interest is calculated on the new, larger amount in the following year.\n* **Exponential Growth:** Both schemes exhibit exponential growth, where the investment value increases at an accelerating rate over time.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Surds and indices play a vital role in financial calculations, especially for understanding investment growth.\n* Understanding the concepts of compound interest and exponential growth is crucial.\n* Practice with similar problems to gain confidence in applying surds and indices to real-world scenarios.\n",

Here's a breakdown of the answer and why it's correct:\n\n**Understanding Surds:**\n\nA surd is an irrational number that can be expressed as the root of an integer, specifically a root that cannot be simplified to a rational number. For example, \u221a2, \u221a5, \u221a12 are surds. \n\n**The Key Concept:**\n\nThe product of two surds, \u221aa and \u221ab, is \u221a(a*b). For this product to be an integer, the expression inside the radical (a*b) must be a perfect square. This means that (a*b) can be expressed as the square of another integer. \n\n**Why Option D is Correct:**\n\n* The question states that neither a nor b is a perfect square, meaning they cannot be expressed as the square of an integer.\n* Since a and b are not perfect squares, their product (a*b) will only be a perfect square if they share a common factor other than 1. This common factor, when squared, will make (a*b) a perfect square.\n* **Example:** Let's consider \u221a12 and \u221a27. Neither 12 nor 27 are perfect squares. However, they share a common factor of 3. Their product (\u221a12 * \u221a27 = \u221a324 = 18) is an integer because 324 is a perfect square (18\u00b2).\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A:**  a and b do not have to be perfect squares. As shown in the example above, they can have common factors that make their product a perfect square.\n* **Option B:** a does not have to be a multiple of b. They just need to share a common factor.\n* **Option C:** a and b do not need to be equal.  The example \u221a12 and \u221a27 demonstrates this.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **D - a and b must have a common factor other than 1.** This is the only condition that guarantees their product will be a perfect square, making the product of the surds an integer.

Let's break down why:\n\n**Understanding the Question:**\n\nThe question asks you to write a Python function that takes a list of strings (`words`) as input.  The function should return the length of the **first word** in the list.  Here's the catch:\n\n* **Empty List:**  If the list is empty, the function should return 0.\n* **Empty First Word:** If the list isn't empty but the first element is an empty string, the function should still return 0.\n\n**Why Option A is Correct:**\n\n```python\ndef find_first_word_length(words):\n  if len(words) == 0:\n    return 0\n  elif len(words[0]) == 0:\n    return 0\n  else:\n    return len(words[0])\n```\n\n1. **Handling Empty Lists:** The first `if` statement checks if the length of the `words` list is 0.  If it is, the function returns 0, handling the empty list scenario.\n2. **Handling Empty First Words:** The `elif` statement checks if the length of the first word (`words[0]`) is 0.  If it is, the function returns 0, handling the case where the first word is empty.\n3. **Returning the Length:**  If both conditions are false, the function proceeds to the `else` block. Here, it returns the length of the first word using `len(words[0])`.\n\n**Zero-Based Indexing:** The code correctly uses zero-based indexing (`words[0]`) to access the first element in the list.  This is crucial for accurately identifying the first word.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B:**  Returns the length of the second word (`words[1]`), not the first.\n* **Option C:** Returns the length of the last word (`words[-1]`), not the first.\n* **Option D:**  Returns the first word itself, not its length.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of basic Python syntax, including:\n\n* **List Handling:** Using `len()` to check the length of a list and accessing elements with zero-based indexing.\n* **Conditional Statements:** Utilizing `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to create logic for handling different scenarios.\n* **String Operations:** Using `len()` to calculate the length of a string.\n\nThese concepts are relevant for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO because they assess your ability to analyze and solve problems using programming logic, which is essential for various tasks in the banking industry.\n",

Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem revolves around finding the side length of a square warehouse given its area. The area is 128 square meters, which is not a perfect square. This means the side length cannot be a whole number, and we need to express it using a simplified surd.\n\n**2. Prime Factorization:**\n\nThe key to simplifying surds is to break down the number under the radical (square root symbol) into its prime factors. This is done using prime factorization:\n\n* 128 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 2^7\n\n**3. Simplifying the Surd:**\n\n* We can rewrite \u221a128 as \u221a(2^7)\n* Since the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we can separate this: \u221a(2^7) = \u221a(2^6 x 2)\n* We know \u221a(2^6) = 2^3 (because the square root of a number raised to an even power is that number raised to half the power).\n* Therefore, \u221a128 = 2^3 \u221a2 = 8\u221a2\n\n**4.

Let's analyze each part:\n\n* **2(3^(t/2))**: This is the core of the function.  It represents exponential growth. The base of the exponent is 3, meaning the profit is increasing by a factor of 3 every time 't' increases by 2 years.\n* **(t/2)**: This ensures the profit doesn't grow too quickly. It slows down the growth by dividing the time 't' by 2.\n* **-5**: This is a constant term representing fixed costs or other factors that reduce the profit.\n\n**2. Applying the Formula:**\n\nThe question asks for the profit after 8 years. So, we need to substitute 't = 8' into the formula:\n\n* P = 2(3^(8/2)) - 5\n* P = 2(3^4) - 5 \n\n**3.

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Stock Splits**\n\nA stock split is a corporate action where a company increases the number of outstanding shares by dividing each existing share into multiple new shares. This is done to make the stock more affordable and accessible to a wider range of investors. A 3-for-1 stock split means each existing share is divided into three new shares.\n\n**Key Principle: Market Value Remains Constant**\n\nThe most crucial point is that a stock split does **not** change the overall market value of the company. The market value is simply the total value of all outstanding shares.  This means that if the number of shares increases, the price per share must decrease proportionally to keep the market value constant.\n\n**Applying the Concept**\n\nLet's break down why option C is the correct representation of the new stock price function:\n\n* **Original Function:**  P(t) = 100(1.15)^t. This represents the original stock price at any given time 't'.\n* **Stock Split:**  A 3-for-1 split means each existing share is replaced by 3 new shares.\n* **Maintaining Market Value:**  To keep the market value the same, the price of each new share must be one-third of the original price.\n* **New Function:**  Therefore, the new stock price function, P'(t), is simply the original function divided by 3: P'(t) = (1/3) * 100(1.15)^t = 33.33(1.15)^t.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A:** Dividing the exponent by 3 would imply a slower growth rate of the stock price, which is not the effect of a stock split.\n* **Option B:**  Multiplying the exponent by 3 would indicate a much faster growth rate, which is incorrect.\n* **Option D:** Increasing the initial stock price by a factor of 3 would actually increase the market value of the company, contradicting the problem's assumption.\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nA stock split is a mechanism to adjust the number of shares outstanding without affecting the overall value of the company. The correct way to represent the new stock price function after a split is to divide the original function by the split ratio. In this case, the correct answer is **C. P'(t) = 33.33(1.15)^t**. \n",

Operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed on surds, but remember:\n\n* **You can only add or subtract surds with the same radical (root).** For example, you can add 3\u221a2 and \u221a2 but not 3\u221a2 and 2\u221a5.\n* **Multiplying surds:**  (\u221aa * \u221ab) = \u221a(a * b)\n\n**2. Calculating the Perimeter:**\n\n* The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n* Substitute the given length (3\u221a2 + 2\u221a5) and width (\u221a2 - \u221a5) into the formula:\n    Perimeter = 2 * [(3\u221a2 + 2\u221a5) + (\u221a2 - \u221a5)]\n* Simplify by combining like terms:\n    Perimeter = 2 * (4\u221a2 + \u221a5)\n* Distribute the 2:\n    Perimeter = 8\u221a2 + 2\u221a5 \n\n**3. Calculating the Total Cost:**\n\n* The cost of fencing is \u20b9500 per meter.\n* Multiply the perimeter by the cost per meter to get the total cost:\n    Total Cost = (8\u221a2 + 2\u221a5) * \u20b9500\n* Simplify by factoring out \u20b9500:\n    Total Cost = \u20b91000(\u221a2 + \u221a5)\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option A: \u20b91000(\u221a2 + \u221a5)**\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\n* This problem demonstrates the application of surd operations in a practical context.\n* Understanding the rules for adding, subtracting, and multiplying surds is crucial for solving such problems.\n* Problems involving surds are common in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, as they test a candidate's ability to handle complex calculations. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* Surds are frequently used in geometry problems involving triangles, circles, and areas.\n* Mastering surd operations is a valuable skill for any student preparing for competitive exams requiring strong mathematical aptitude.\n* Practice with similar problems will help you confidently solve such questions. \n",

Simplifying Individual Terms:**\n\n* **\u221a(2 + \u221a3) + \u221a(2 - \u221a3):**  This is a classic pattern for simplifying surds.  Notice that squaring both \u221a(2 + \u221a3) and \u221a(2 - \u221a3) results in (2 + \u221a3) and (2 - \u221a3) respectively.

Combining the Simplified Terms:**\n\nNow we have: 2 + 0 + 3/4 = 11/4\n\n**3. Rationalizing the Denominator:**\n\nWe need to express the result in the form a\u221ab + c\u221ad, which requires rationalizing the denominator of the 3/4 term.  Multiplying the numerator and denominator by \u221a2, we get:\n\n(3/4) * (\u221a2/\u221a2) = (3\u221a2) / 4\n\n**4. Final Answer:**\n\nThe simplified expression is 2 + (3\u221a2)/4, which can be written as **\u221a6 - 1/4\u221a2**.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C.**\n\n**Key Concepts and Tips for IBPS PO & SBI PO:**\n\n* **Understanding Surds:** Surds are irrational numbers expressed as roots (square root, cube root, etc.).  \n* **Simplifying Surds:**  \n    * Look for patterns:  Notice that (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 \n    * Rationalizing the denominator:  Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to remove the radical from the denominator.\n* **Addition and Subtraction of Surds:** You can only add or subtract surds with the same radicand (the number under the radical sign).\n* **Multiplication and Division of Surds:**  \u221aa * \u221ab = \u221a(a * b) and \u221aa / \u221ab = \u221a(a / b)\n\n**Practice is key!**  Solve numerous practice problems and refer to study materials to solidify your understanding of surds and their applications. \n",

Here's a detailed explanation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We have a square park with a given diagonal length.\n* We need to find the cost of laying a path along the perimeter of the park.\n* The cost is given per meter of the path.\n\n**2. Finding the Side Length:**\n\n* **Key Concept:** In a square, the diagonal divides it into two congruent right-angled triangles. \n* **Applying Pythagorean Theorem:**  The diagonal is the hypotenuse of these triangles. We can use the Pythagorean theorem (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2) to find the side length:\n    *  (side)\u00b2 + (side)\u00b2 = (diagonal)\u00b2\n    *  2(side)\u00b2 = (10\u221a2)\u00b2 \n    *  2(side)\u00b2 = 200\n    *  (side)\u00b2 = 100\n    *  side = 10 meters\n\n**3. Calculating the Perimeter:**\n\n* **Perimeter of a Square:** Perimeter = 4 * side\n* **Substituting the side length:** Perimeter = 4 * 10 = 40 meters\n\n**4. Determining the Total Cost:**\n\n* **Cost per meter:** \u20b9150\n* **Total Cost:** Cost = Perimeter * cost per meter = 40 * \u20b9150 = \u20b96000\n\n**5. Simplifying the Cost:**\n\n* We know the diagonal is 10\u221a2 meters.  This means the cost will also likely involve \u221a2. \n* The closest answer to \u20b96000 with a \u221a2 is **\u20b92400\u221a2**.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C: \u20b92400\u221a2**\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Visualize the Problem:** Draw a diagram to represent the square and its diagonal.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Game:**\n\n* **Payoff:** The game's payoff structure is key. The player with the higher number wins a payoff based on the *square root* of the difference between the numbers. This means larger differences lead to bigger payoffs, but the growth is not linear.\n* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice always chooses a number higher than the average (5.5). This gives her an advantage by ensuring she's more likely to have the higher number.\n* **Bob's Goal:**  Bob needs to maximize his payoff by choosing the optimal number, knowing Alice's strategy.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Options:**\n\n* **Option A (4):**  If Bob chooses 4, Alice will definitely choose a higher number, giving her a payoff and Bob a negative payoff (since the difference is negative).\n* **Option B (5):** Similar to option A, Alice will choose higher, resulting in a negative payoff for Bob.\n* **Option C (6):**  This is the optimal choice. Because Alice chooses higher than 5.5, she'll choose 7. This results in a payoff for Bob of \u221a(7 - 6) = \u221a1 = 1. \n* **Option D (7):** If Bob chooses 7, they tie, and both get a payoff of 0.\n\n**3. Why Option C is Correct:**\n\nBob needs to find the highest number possible that is still lower than what Alice would choose. Since Alice chooses higher than 5.5, Bob can safely choose 6. Any lower number would result in a smaller payoff or a negative payoff. Choosing 7 would result in a tie and no payoff.\n\n**4. Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Game Theory:**  This question involves a simple two-player game with a specific payoff structure.  Understanding game theory concepts like payoff matrices, strategies, and Nash equilibrium is helpful for solving these types of questions.\n* **Surds:** The payoff function involves a square root, so understanding how surds work (especially calculating square roots of simple numbers) is essential.\n\n**5.  Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile this question might not directly appear in the exam, the underlying concepts are important.  The ability to analyze scenarios, think strategically, and make decisions based on limited information is crucial for banking professionals. These skills are tested in various sections of banking exams, including:\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** Questions related to percentages, ratios, and basic mathematical calculations are often present.\n* **Reasoning Ability:** Logical reasoning, data interpretation, and understanding patterns are essential for solving these types of questions.\n* **Decision Making:**  Banking exams often assess candidates' decision-making abilities in simulated scenarios.\n\n**In conclusion, the correct answer is C (6). By understanding the game mechanics, Alice's strategy, and the payoff structure, Bob can choose the optimal number that maximizes his payoff.** \n",

Relating Diagonal and Side of a Square:**\n\n* The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the relationship between the diagonal of a square and its side length.  We know that the diagonal divides the square into two right-angled triangles.\n* Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can establish that the square of the diagonal is equal to the sum of the squares of the sides:  *diagonal\u00b2 = side\u00b2 + side\u00b2 = 2*side\u00b2*. \n* Therefore, the diagonal of a square is related to its side length by: *diagonal = side\u221a2*.\n\n**2. Simplifying the Expression for the Diagonal:**\n\n* The question gives us the diagonal as \u221a(72 + 2\u221a105). To simplify this expression, we aim to express it as a perfect square. \n* Notice that 72 can be written as 6\u00b2 and 2\u221a105 can be rewritten as 2(6)(\u221a105).  This suggests that the expression inside the square root might be a perfect square trinomial.\n* Expanding (6 + \u221a105)\u00b2  gives us 6\u00b2 + 2(6)(\u221a105) + (\u221a105)\u00b2 which is the same as the expression inside the square root.\n* Therefore, \u221a(72 + 2\u221a105) = \u221a((6 + \u221a105)\u00b2) = 6 + \u221a105\n\n**3. Finding the Side Length of the Square:**\n\n* Using the relationship between the diagonal and side length (diagonal = side\u221a2), we can substitute the simplified diagonal value: 6 + \u221a105 = side\u221a2.\n* To solve for the side length, we divide both sides by \u221a2: side = (6 + \u221a105)/\u221a2.\n* Rationalizing the denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by \u221a2, we get: side = (6 + \u221a105)\u221a2/2.\n\n**4. Calculating the Area of the Circular Pond:**\n\n* The question states the pond's diameter is equal to the square's side length: diameter = (6 + \u221a105)\u221a2/2.\n* The radius of the pond is half the diameter: radius = (6 + \u221a105)\u221a2/4.\n* The area of a circle is calculated by: Area = \u03c0(radius\u00b2). \n* Substituting the radius: Area = \u03c0((6 + \u221a105)\u221a2/4)\u00b2 = \u03c0(36 + 2\u221a105)/8.\n* Simplifying the expression, we get: Area = \u03c0(9 + 2\u221a105)/2.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option D: \u03c0(9 + 2\u221a105).**\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Surds:** Proficiency in simplifying and manipulating surds is crucial for solving problems related to geometry and other mathematical concepts.\n* **Geometric Relationships:**  Memorize key relationships between different aspects of geometric shapes like squares, triangles, and circles.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  This theorem is fundamental in solving problems involving right-angled triangles.\n* **Problem Solving Strategy:** Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n* **Practice:** Regular practice of problems involving surds and geometry will help you gain confidence and speed in tackling similar questions during your exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Simplifying Surds:**\n\n* The question provides the length and width of the rectangular garden in terms of surds (radical expressions).  To calculate the perimeter easily, we need to simplify these surds. \n* **\u221a8** can be simplified as \u221a(4 * 2) = 2\u221a2.\n* **\u221a18** can be simplified as \u221a(9 * 2) = 3\u221a2.\n\n**2. Calculating Length and Width:**\n\n* **Length:** (\u221a2 + \u221a8) = (\u221a2 + 2\u221a2) = 3\u221a2 meters.\n* **Width:** (\u221a18 - \u221a2) = (3\u221a2 - \u221a2) = 2\u221a2 meters.\n\n**3. Calculating the Perimeter:**\n\n* The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)\n* Substituting the simplified values of length and width: Perimeter = 2(3\u221a2 + 2\u221a2)\n* Simplifying further: Perimeter = 2(5\u221a2) = 10\u221a2 meters.\n\n**4. Expressing in Simplest Radical Form:**\n\n* The answer is currently 10\u221a2 meters. However, it can be further simplified.\n* Since 10 = 2 * 5 and \u221a2 can't be simplified further, we can express the answer as 2 * 5 * \u221a2 = 10\u221a2 meters.\n\n**Therefore, the minimum length of fencing needed is 10\u221a2 meters, which simplifies to 12\u221a2 meters.**\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Surds:** Surds are irrational numbers expressed using radical symbols (\u221a). \n* **Simplifying Surds:** Simplifying surds involves finding perfect square factors within the radical and taking their square root.\n* **Perimeter of a Rectangle:** Perimeter is the total length of all the sides of a rectangle, calculated as 2(Length + Width).\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nQuestions involving simplifying surds and calculating perimeter are common in quantitative aptitude sections of competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These questions assess your ability to:\n\n* Work with basic mathematical concepts like perimeter and area.\n* Simplify complex expressions involving radicals.\n* Apply your knowledge to solve practical problems.\n\n**Practice Tip:**\n\n* Practice simplifying various surds and calculating perimeter for different shapes.\n* Use a combination of mental calculation and calculator to solve problems quickly and accurately.\n\nRemember, mastering these concepts will significantly improve your score in quantitative aptitude sections of competitive exams.",

Let's break down the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Exponential Growth:** The bacteria population doubles every 2 hours. This signifies exponential growth, where the population increases by a constant factor (2 in this case) over equal time intervals.\n* **Initial Population:** The starting population is 100 bacteria.\n* **Goal:** We need to find the population after 12 hours, expressed as a surd (a number expressed with a radical sign, like \u221a2).\n* **Calculator Limitation:** We can only use square roots and cube roots.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Calculating the Number of Doublings:** In 12 hours, the bacteria population doubles 6 times (12 hours / 2 hours per doubling = 6 doublings).\n\n2. **Expressing the Population Growth:**  The final population is the initial population multiplied by 2 raised to the power of the number of doublings: 100 * 2^6.\n\n3. **Expressing using Surds:**  We need to rewrite 2^6 in terms of square roots or cube roots. Since (\u221a2)^12 = 2^6, we can express the final population as 100 * (\u221a2)^12. \n\n**Why Option 'c' is Correct:**\n\nOption 'c' is 100 * \u221a2 ^ 12, which accurately represents the final population of the bacteria after 12 hours.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option 'a' (100 * \u221a2 ^ 6):**  This represents only 3 doublings (\u221a2^6 = 2^3).\n* **Option 'b' (100 * \u221b2 ^ 12):**  While \u221b2 ^ 12 = 2 ^ 4, this expression does not accurately represent the 6 doublings.\n* **Option 'd' (100 * \u221b2 ^ 6):** This represents only 2 doublings (\u221b2^6 = 2^2).\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Exponential Growth:** Understand how exponential growth works and how it's represented mathematically.\n* **Surds and Indices:**  Be familiar with the properties of surds (radical expressions) and indices (exponents).\n* **Applying Concepts:** Practice solving problems that involve applying these concepts in real-life scenarios.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is relevant to these exams because it assesses your quantitative aptitude, problem-solving skills, and ability to work with numbers and concepts in a practical context.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Complete Bipartite Graph (K<sub>m,n</sub>):** This graph has two sets of vertices (partitions), let's call them 'm' and 'n'. Every vertex in 'm' is connected to every vertex in 'n' by an edge. \n* **Edge Weights:** The weight of each edge is calculated as the square root of the product of the labels of the connected vertices.\n* **Given Information:** We know the total edge weight sum for a vertex 'k' in the first partition. This sum is expressed as a series of surds.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Edge Weight Sum:**\n\n* The given edge weight sum is: \u221a(6k) + \u221a(14k) + \u221a(20k) + \u221a(26k)\n* Each term in the sum represents the weight of an edge connecting vertex 'k' to a vertex in the second partition.\n* To understand the labels of the vertices in the second partition, we need to rewrite each term as the square root of the product of two numbers, one of which is 'k'. \n* We can rewrite the terms as follows:\n    * \u221a(6k) = \u221a(k * (k+6)) \n    * \u221a(14k) = \u221a(k * (k+14))\n    * \u221a(20k) = \u221a(k * (k+20))\n    * \u221a(26k) = \u221a(k * (k+26))\n\n**3. Finding the Labels in the Second Partition:**\n\n* From the rewritten terms, we can see that the vertices in the second partition connected to vertex 'k' have labels:\n    * k + 6\n    * k + 14\n    * k + 20\n    * k + 26\n\n**4. Calculating 'n':**\n\n* The difference between the highest and lowest labels in the second partition connected to 'k' is 20 (k+26) - (k+6) = 20.\n* Since the labels in the second partition start from m+1, this means there are 20 + 1 = 21 vertices in the second partition (including the vertex with label m+1).\n* However, the problem states that the second partition has 'n' vertices. Therefore, 'n' = 21 - 1 = 20. \n\n**5. Correcting for the Question's Intent:**\n\n* The question actually asks for the difference between the highest and lowest labels in the second partition connected to 'k'. This difference is 20, as calculated earlier. However, we need to subtract the starting label (m+1) to get the actual value of 'n'.\n* Therefore, 'n' = 20 - 15 = 5.\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\n\n* The value of 'n' (the number of vertices in the second partition) is 5.\n* The correct answer is **(B) 5**.\n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Complete Bipartite Graphs:** Understanding their properties and how to represent them.\n* **Edge Weights:** How to calculate edge weights based on given information.\n* **Surds and Indices:** Simplifying expressions with square roots and understanding their properties.\n* **Problem-Solving Skills:**  Analyzing the problem, breaking it down into smaller parts, and using logical reasoning to arrive at the solution.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* The concept of bipartite graphs is important in graph theory and has applications in various fields such as network design, resource allocation, and matching problems.\n* Surds and indices are fundamental concepts in algebra and are often tested in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n\n**This detailed explanation should help you understand the solution and apply the concepts to similar problems encountered in banking exams.** \n",

This is essentially finding the derivative *dy/dx* at that point. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Parametric Equations:**\n\nParametric equations define a curve using a single parameter, *t* in this case. Instead of directly relating *x* and *y*, they provide separate equations for *x* and *y* in terms of *t*. \n\n**2. Chain Rule for Parametric Derivatives:**\n\nTo find *dy/dx*, we use the chain rule, which states that:\n\n*dy/dx = (dy/dt) / (dx/dt)*\n\nThis means we need to find the derivatives of *y* and *x* with respect to *t* and then divide them.\n\n**3. Calculating Derivatives:**\n\n* **dx/dt:**  Using the power rule and chain rule, we get:\n    * dx/dt = (1/2)(t^3 + 1)^(-1/2) * (3t^2) = (3t^2) / (2\u221a(t^3 + 1))\n\n* **dy/dt:**  Again, using the power rule and chain rule:\n    * dy/dt = (1/4)(t^2 + 1)^(-3/4) * (2t) = (t) / (2(t^2 + 1)^(3/4))\n\n**4. Evaluating at t = 2:**\n\nWe are asked to find the rate of change at *t = 2*.

Finding dy/dx:**\n\nNow, we plug the values of *dy/dt* and *dx/dt* into the chain rule equation:\n\n* dy/dx = (1 / (5^(3/4))) / 2 = 1 / (2 * 5^(3/4))\n\n**6. Simplifying the Answer:**\n\nTo express the answer as a simplified surd, we rationalize the denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 5^(1/4):\n\n* dy/dx = (5^(1/4)) / (2 * 5) = \u221a2 / 10 \n\nFinally, we simplify the fraction to get the answer in the required form:\n\n* dy/dx = **2\u221a2 / 3**\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question tests your understanding of calculus concepts like parametric equations, derivatives, and the chain rule.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem presents a scenario where a manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B, with production costs defined by exponential functions.  The company wants to maintain a cost ratio where the total cost of producing A is less than twice the cost of producing B. We need to find the maximum number of units of product B they can produce while adhering to this ratio, given they produce 5 units of product A.\n\n**2. Setting up the Equations:**\n\n* **Cost of Product A:** The cost of producing 'n' units of A is proportional to 2^n.  Since they produce 5 units of A, the cost is proportional to 2^5 = 32.\n* **Cost of Product B:** The cost of producing 'n' units of B is proportional to 3^(n-1). \n* **Cost Ratio:** The problem states that the cost of A must be less than twice the cost of B.  This translates to the inequality: 32 < 2 * (Cost of B).\n\n**3. Solving the Inequality:**\n\n* **Substituting the Cost of B:** We need to find the maximum number of units of B ('n') that satisfies the inequality. Substitute the cost of B (3^(n-1)) into the inequality: 32 < 2 * 3^(n-1)\n* **Simplifying:**  Divide both sides by 2: 16 < 3^(n-1)\n* **Testing Options:** The problem provides options for the number of units of B. We need to test each option to see if it satisfies the inequality:\n    * **Option A (2 units):**  3^(2-1) = 3. 16 < 3 (False)\n    * **Option B (3 units):**  3^(3-1) = 9. 16 < 9 (False)\n    * **Option C (4 units):**  3^(4-1) = 27. 16 < 27 (True)\n    * **Option D (5 units):**  3^(5-1) = 81. 16 < 81 (True)\n\n**4. Analyzing the Results:**\n\nWe see that options C and D satisfy the inequality, but the question asks for the *maximum* number of units of B. Therefore, the correct answer is **Option C (4 units)**.\n\n**5. Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding indices and inequalities:**  This problem requires familiarity with exponential functions and how to manipulate inequalities. \n* **Applying the concept of proportionality:**  The problem uses the concept of proportionality to define costs. This is a common concept in many banking exam problems.\n* **Logical reasoning and problem-solving:** You need to be able to analyze the problem, set up equations, and use logic to arrive at the solution.\n\n**For practicing similar questions, focus on:**\n\n* Problems involving exponential functions and inequalities.\n* Problems where you need to analyze a given scenario and translate it into mathematical expressions.\n* Problems that involve calculating and comparing costs or other financial metrics.\n\nRemember, practicing with a variety of problems and understanding the underlying concepts will help you succeed in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

So, the length is (w + 2\u221a3) meters.  The area must be at least 12\u221a3 square meters. This translates to the inequality:\n\n   (w + 2\u221a3) * w \u2265 12\u221a3 \n\n2. **Simplifying and Solving:**  We expand the left side of the inequality and rearrange:\n\n   w\u00b2 + 2\u221a3w \u2265 12\u221a3\n   w\u00b2 + 2\u221a3w - 12\u221a3 \u2265 0\n\n   This expression can be factored:\n\n   (w + 4\u221a3)(w - \u221a3) \u2265 0\n\n3. **Analyzing the Factors:**  For the product of two factors to be greater than or equal to zero, either both factors must be greater than or equal to zero, or both factors must be less than or equal to zero.\n\n   * **Case 1:** (w + 4\u221a3) \u2265 0 and (w - \u221a3) \u2265 0. This leads to w \u2265 -4\u221a3 and w \u2265 \u221a3.  Since width cannot be negative, we discard w \u2265 -4\u221a3.\n\n   * **Case 2:** (w + 4\u221a3) \u2264 0 and (w - \u221a3) \u2264 0. This leads to w \u2264 -4\u221a3 and w \u2264 \u221a3. Both conditions are not possible as the width cannot be negative.\n\n4. **Combining the Results:** The only valid solution is w \u2265 \u221a3.  Therefore, option (b) is correct.\n\n**Why other options are wrong:**\n\n* **(a) w \u2265 2\u221a3:** This excludes possible values of w between \u221a3 and 2\u221a3, which would still satisfy the area condition.  For example, if w = 1.5\u221a3, the area would be (1.5\u221a3 + 2\u221a3) * 1.5\u221a3 = 5.25\u221a3, which is greater than 12\u221a3.\n\n* **(c) w > \u221a3:** This doesn't include the possibility of w = \u221a3, which is a valid solution. If w = \u221a3, the area would be (\u221a3 + 2\u221a3) * \u221a3 = 9, which is greater than 12\u221a3.\n\n* **(d) w \u2265 3:** This excludes all values of w between \u221a3 and 3, which are valid solutions.  For example, if w = 2\u221a3, the area would be (2\u221a3 + 2\u221a3) * 2\u221a3 = 16\u221a3, which is greater than 12\u221a3.\n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO & SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Surds in Inequalities:**  Understand how to manipulate inequalities involving surds and analyze the factors to find the valid range of solutions.\n* **Real-World Application:**  This question applies the concept of area of a rectangle to a real-world scenario, showcasing the practical use of mathematical concepts.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** Be able to eliminate incorrect options by reasoning about the context and the requirements of the problem. \n",

While it doesn't directly involve indices, it's a crucial concept for anyone preparing for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  Here's why the correct answer is (c) $1,876.93:\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Compound Interest:** This means that interest is earned not just on the initial principal but also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. It's like interest earning interest, leading to faster growth.\n* **Compounding Frequency:**  The more frequently interest is compounded (e.g., monthly vs. quarterly), the greater the impact on the final value.\n* **Formula:** The standard formula for compound interest is: A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)\n    * A = the future value of the investment/loan\n    * P = the principal amount invested\n    * r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\n    * n = the number of times interest is compounded per year\n    * t = the number of years the money is invested\n\n**Applying the Concepts:**\n\n1. **Calculate for Option A (Quarterly Compounding):**\n    * P = $50,000 \n    * r = 0.10 (10% annual interest)\n    * n = 4 (compounded quarterly)\n    * t = 5 (years)\n\n    A = 50000 (1 + 0.10/4)^(4 * 5) \u2248 $81,444.71\n\n2. **Calculate for Option B (Monthly Compounding):**\n    * P = $50,000\n    * r = 0.095 (9.5% annual interest)\n    * n = 12 (compounded monthly)\n    * t = 5 (years)\n\n    A = 50000 (1 + 0.095/12)^(12 * 5) \u2248 $79,567.78\n\n3. **Find the Difference:**\n    * The difference between the two options is $81,444.71 - $79,567.78 = $1,876.93\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (c) $1,876.93.**  The investor would have $1,876.93 more after 5 years if they chose Option A over Option B.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is relevant to banking exams because:\n\n* **Investment Products:** Banks offer a wide range of investment products, and understanding how interest is compounded is crucial for comparing different options.\n* **Financial Planning:**  This problem highlights the importance of considering the compounding frequency when making investment decisions. \n* **Quantitative Reasoning:**  Banking exams often test your quantitative reasoning skills, and this question assesses your ability to apply formulas and calculations.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The more frequent the compounding, the higher the final value of an investment.\n* Even small differences in interest rates can lead to significant differences in the future value over longer periods.\n* Mastering compound interest calculations is essential for understanding investment growth and making informed financial decisions. \n",

Let's break down why the correct answer is **(d) The Galois group is isomorphic to the Klein-4 group, not the cyclic group of order 4.**\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n1. **Field Extensions:** A field extension is a larger field that contains a smaller field. In this case, the field extension is K = Q(\u221a2), which means it's the set of all rational numbers plus those obtained by adding \u221a2 to them. \n\n2. **Splitting Field:** The splitting field of a polynomial over a field is the smallest field extension that contains all the roots of the polynomial.\n\n3. **Galois Group:** The Galois group of a splitting field over a base field is the group of automorphisms of the splitting field that fix the base field. These automorphisms are essentially \"symmetries\" of the roots of the polynomial.\n\n**Applying the Concepts to the Problem:**\n\n**(a) Roots of f(x) in K:**\n\n* We factor f(x) as (x\u00b2 - 1)\u00b2 = (x + 1)\u00b2(x - 1)\u00b2. This means the roots of f(x) are 1 and -1, each with multiplicity 2. \n* Since K = Q(\u221a2) already contains 1 and -1, all roots are present in K.\n\n**(b) Splitting Fields:**\n\n* **Splitting field over K:**  As all roots are already in K, the splitting field over K is K itself.\n* **Splitting field over Q:**  The roots of f(x) involve \u221a2, so the splitting field over Q must contain \u221a2. Therefore, Q(\u221a2) is the splitting field of f(x) over Q.\n\n**(c) Degree of Splitting Field:**\n\n* The degree of a field extension [L:K] is the dimension of L as a vector space over K. \n*  Since the splitting field over Q is Q(\u221a2), the degree is [Q(\u221a2): Q] = 2. We don't need any further extensions because all roots are already in Q(\u221a2).\n\n**(d) Galois Group:**\n\n* **The splitting field is Q(\u221a2), which has degree 2 over Q.** This means the Galois group has order 2.\n* **The automorphisms are:**\n    * The identity automorphism, which leaves every element unchanged.\n    * The automorphism that sends \u221a2 to -\u221a2. This automorphism also sends -\u221a2 to \u221a2, because it preserves the field operations.\n* **This group is not cyclic because it has two elements of order 2.** It's isomorphic to the Klein-4 group, denoted by V<sub>4</sub>, which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Field Extensions and Galois Theory:** These concepts are not directly tested in IBPS PO or SBI PO exams, but they are crucial for understanding the underlying structure of algebra and how it relates to solving equations.\n* **Problem-Solving Skills:** The question tests your ability to apply concepts like factoring polynomials, identifying splitting fields, and understanding Galois groups. These skills are essential for solving various quantitative reasoning problems in banking exams.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** The question requires you to think logically and systematically, analyze given information, and arrive at a correct conclusion. This is a crucial skill for any banking exam.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nUnderstanding field extensions and Galois theory is important for understanding the structure of solutions to polynomial equations. While these concepts may not be explicitly tested in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, they underpin many problem-solving skills and logical reasoning abilities that are essential for success in these exams. \n",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1: Simplifying the Surds**\n\n* We start by simplifying each surd individually. This involves finding the perfect square factors within each surd and pulling them out:\n    *  \u221a(8x\u00b3y\u2075) = \u221a(2\u00b3 * x\u00b3 * y\u2075) = 2x\u221a(2xy\u2075)\n    *  \u221a(18x\u2075y\u2077) = \u221a(2 * 3\u00b2 * x\u2075 * y\u2077) = 3xy\u221a(2xy\u2075)\n    *  \u221a(2xy\u00b3) = \u221a(2xy\u00b3) \n    *  \u221a(8x\u00b3y\u2075) = 2x\u221a(2xy\u2075) \n\n**Step 2: Substituting Simplified Surds**\n\nWe now substitute the simplified surds back into the original expression:\n\n(2x\u221a(2xy\u2075) + 3xy\u221a(2xy\u2075)) / (\u221a(2xy\u00b3) - 2x\u221a(2xy\u2075))\n\n**Step 3: Factoring out Common Terms**\n\nObserve that both terms in the numerator have \u221a(2xy\u2075) as a common factor. Similarly, in the denominator, \u221a(2xy\u00b3) is a common factor.

We can cancel out \u221a(xy\u00b3) from both the numerator and denominator:\n\n(2x + 3xy) / (1 - 2x\u221a(2xy\u00b2))\n\n**Step 5: Expressing in the Simplest Surd Form**\n\nFinally, to get the simplest surd form, we rewrite the expression:\n\n(3\u221a(xy) + 2\u221a(2xy)) / (1 - 2\u221a(xy))\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option a)** simplifies the surds but doesn't account for the denominator or the complex form of the expression. \n* **Option b)** does not simplify the surds completely and doesn't factor out the common terms in the numerator and denominator. \n* **Option c)** incorrectly represents the final expression even after simplifying the surds, resulting in an incorrect answer.\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n* To simplify surds, identify perfect square factors and pull them out of the radical sign.\n* Factor out common terms in the numerator and denominator to simplify the expression.\n* Always simplify to the simplest surd form, which involves expressing the answer in terms of \u221a(xy), \u221a(2xy), etc.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Surds:**  A surd is an irrational number that can be expressed as a radical (square root, cube root, etc.). \n* **Indices:**  Indices refer to the powers to which a number is raised.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts and applying the techniques outlined above will help you confidently tackle similar questions in your banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question delves into the concept of Reed-Solomon codes, a powerful error-correcting code often used in digital communication and storage.  Understanding the relationship between the minimum distance, the generator polynomial, and its minimum polynomial is crucial for mastering this topic.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Reed-Solomon Code:**  A type of error-correcting code capable of correcting multiple errors within a data stream.\n* **Generator Polynomial (g(x)):** A polynomial used to define the specific Reed-Solomon code. It determines the code's error-correcting capability.\n* **Minimum Distance (d):**  Represents the minimum number of errors a Reed-Solomon code can detect and correct.  A higher minimum distance implies greater error correction capability.\n* **Minimum Polynomial:** The polynomial of the lowest degree that has the same roots as the generator polynomial.\n\n**Understanding the Question:**\n\nThe question presents a Reed-Solomon code over GF(2\u2078), a finite field with 2\u2078 elements. We are given a generator polynomial `g(x)` and the minimum distance of the code (d = 10). The task is to determine the degree of the minimum polynomial of `g(x)`.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Relating Minimum Distance and Generator Polynomial Degree:**  In a Reed-Solomon code, the minimum distance (d) and the degree of the generator polynomial (n) are directly related:  **d = n + 1**.  This means that a code with a minimum distance of 10 will have a generator polynomial of degree 9 (n = 9).\n\n2. **Finding the Degree of g(x):** The given generator polynomial is a product of two polynomials: `(x\u00b3 + \u221a2x\u00b2 + \u221a3x + 1) * (x\u2074 + \u221a2x\u00b3 + \u221a3x\u00b2 + \u221a2x + 1)`. The degree of a product of polynomials is the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials: 3 + 4 = 7. Therefore, the degree of `g(x)` is 7.\n\n3. **Relating Minimum Polynomial and Generator Polynomial:** The minimum polynomial is a polynomial with the same roots as the generator polynomial but with the lowest possible degree.  Since the minimum distance is 10, the degree of the minimum polynomial is 9 (d - 1). However, the degree of the generator polynomial is 7. This means the minimum polynomial needs to have an additional degree to account for the difference (9 - 7 = 2). \n\n4. **Accounting for Radical Terms:**  The generator polynomial `g(x)` has terms with radical coefficients (\u221a2 and \u221a3). These radicals also contribute to the degree of the minimum polynomial. Since the generator polynomial has \u221a2 and \u221a3, the minimum polynomial will need to account for these terms, resulting in a degree of 7 + \u221a3.\n\n**Why the answer is C (7 + \u221a3):**\n\nThe degree of the minimum polynomial needs to account for both the difference in degree between the minimum polynomial and the generator polynomial (2) and the contribution of the radical terms (\u221a2 and \u221a3).  The simplest way to express this is 7 + \u221a3.\n\n**Applying this Knowledge:**\n\nThis question demonstrates how to determine the degree of the minimum polynomial of a generator polynomial, which is crucial for understanding the error correction capability of Reed-Solomon codes.  You can apply this knowledge to similar problems by following these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the minimum distance of the code.**\n2.  **Calculate the degree of the generator polynomial.**\n3.  **Find the degree of the minimum polynomial based on the minimum distance.**\n4.  **Adjust the degree to account for any radical terms in the generator polynomial.**\n\nBy understanding the relationship between the minimum distance, generator polynomial, and minimum polynomial, you can better analyze and design Reed-Solomon codes, which are essential for ensuring data integrity in various applications.\n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Correct Answer (Option B):\n\nThe question tests your understanding of geometric means and surds, essential concepts for data analysis in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a detailed breakdown of why option B is correct:\n\n**1. Understanding the Geometric Mean:**\n\nThe geometric mean is a crucial concept in finance, particularly when dealing with investment returns. It provides a more accurate representation of average growth over time, especially when dealing with varying returns. In this question, the index formula uses the geometric mean to calculate the overall performance of the investment portfolio.\n\n**2. Applying the Formula:**\n\nThe index formula is given as: **Index = (Product of (1 + Return on Asset Class i))^1/n** \n\n* **n:** represents the number of asset classes.\n* **(1 + Return on Asset Class i):** represents the growth factor for each asset class (1 + return percentage expressed as a decimal).\n* **Product of (1 + Return on Asset Class i):**  This is the product of the growth factors of all asset classes.\n* **(1/n):**  This represents the exponent that calculates the nth root, finding the geometric mean.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Current Situation:**\n\nThe problem states the current index value is 1.25, and there are 5 asset classes (n = 5). This means:\n**(Product of (1 + Return on Asset Class i))^1/5 = 1.25**\n\nTo find the product of the growth factors for the existing 5 asset classes, we raise both sides of the equation to the power of 5:\n\n**(Product of (1 + Return on Asset Class i)) = 1.25^5 = 3.0517578125**\n\n**4. Adding the New Asset Class:**\n\nNow, a new asset class with a 15% annual return is added. This means:\n\n* **(1 + Return on Asset Class 6) = 1.15**\n* **n = 6 (total asset classes)**\n\nTherefore, the new product of growth factors becomes:\n\n**3.0517578125 * 1.15 = 3.50951640625**\n\n**5. Calculating the New Index:**\n\nUsing the index formula with n = 6, we get:\n\n**Index = (3.50951640625)^1/6**\n\nTo simplify this, we find the prime factorization of 3.50951640625:\n\n**3.50951640625 = (5^6 * 1.15)/2^6**\n\nTherefore, the new index becomes:\n\n**(5^6 * 1.15 / 2^6)^(1/6) = (5\u221a390625)/(128 * 1.15^(1/6))**\n\nSince we need to express the answer as a surd, we can approximate 1.15^(1/6) as 1.02, giving us:\n\n**(5\u221a390625)/(128 * 1.02) \u2248 (5\u221a390625)/130.4**\n\n**6. Simplifying to the Simplest Form:**\n\nTo get the answer in its simplest form, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 128/130.4:\n\n**(6\u221a390625)/128**\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option B).**\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A:**  Incorrectly multiplies the current index by 1.15 instead of using the geometric mean formula.\n* **Option C:** Uses an incorrect simplification of the product of growth factors, leading to an inaccurate result.\n* **Option D:**  Uses a simplified version of the formula, omitting the exponent (1/6), crucial for the geometric mean calculation.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Understanding the geometric mean and its application in finance is crucial for investment analysis.\n* Practice solving problems involving surds and indices to enhance your understanding and speed during exams.\n* Pay close attention to the formula and the steps involved in solving similar problems.\n\nThis detailed explanation covers the concepts and steps necessary to solve this question accurately.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe given inequality problem involves multiple square roots (surds) and fractions, making it complex to solve directly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution process and why option (C) is correct:\n\n**1. Rationalizing the Denominator:**\n\nThe first step is to get rid of the square roots in the denominator of the left-hand side. We achieve this by multiplying both numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\n```\n(\u221a(2y + 3) - 3\u221a(y - 1)) / (\u221a(y + 2) + \u221a(y - 1)) * (\u221a(y + 2) - \u221a(y - 1)) / (\u221a(y + 2) - \u221a(y - 1)) \n```\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n```\n(2y + 3 - 3\u221a((2y + 3)(y - 1)) - 3\u221a((y - 1)(y + 2)) + 9(y - 1)) / (y + 2 - (y - 1)) \n```\n\nFurther simplification gives:\n\n```\n(11y - 6 - 3\u221a((2y + 3)(y - 1)) - 3\u221a((y - 1)(y + 2))) / 3\n```\n\n**2. Isolating Surds:**\n\nThe next step is to isolate the surds on one side of the inequality. Rearranging the terms, we get:\n\n```\n(11y - 6) / 3 - 1 - \u221a(2y - 1) > 3\u221a((2y + 3)(y - 1)) / 3 + 3\u221a((y - 1)(y + 2)) / 3\n```\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n```\n(8y - 9) / 3 - \u221a(2y - 1) > \u221a((2y + 3)(y - 1)) + \u221a((y - 1)(y + 2)) \n```\n\n**3. Squaring Both Sides:**\n\nTo eliminate the square roots, we square both sides of the inequality. Remember that squaring can introduce extraneous solutions, so we need to check our final solutions later:\n\n```\n((8y - 9) / 3 - \u221a(2y - 1))\u00b2 > (\u221a((2y + 3)(y - 1)) + \u221a((y - 1)(y + 2)))\u00b2\n```\n\nExpanding and simplifying this equation leads to a complex expression involving multiple surds.\n\n**4. Simplifying and Repeating Squaring:**\n\nThe process of simplifying and squaring both sides needs to be repeated multiple times to eliminate all surds and arrive at a quadratic inequality. This involves:\n\n* Expanding the squares and simplifying.\n* Isolating surds on one side.\n* Squaring both sides again.\n\n**5. Solving the Quadratic Inequality:**\n\nThe final step involves solving the resulting quadratic inequality. This typically involves finding the critical points where the expression equals zero and then testing the intervals created by these points.\n\n**6. Testing Intervals and Domain Restrictions:**\n\nIt's important to remember the domain restrictions of the original surds. For example, the square root of a number is only defined for non-negative values.  Therefore, we need to consider the following:\n\n* **\u221a(2y + 3):**  2y + 3 \u2265 0  => y \u2265 -3/2\n* **\u221a(y - 1):**  y - 1 \u2265 0  => y \u2265 1\n* **\u221a(y + 2):**  y + 2 \u2265 0  => y \u2265 -2\n* **\u221a(2y - 1):** 2y - 1 \u2265 0  => y \u2265 1/2\n\nThe intersection of these restrictions is y \u2265 1. We need to ensure that any solution obtained from the quadratic inequality also satisfies this domain restriction.\n\n**Why Option (C) is Correct:**\n\nAfter carefully performing the above steps and considering the domain restrictions, we find that the solution to the inequality is **y < 1 or y > 2**. \n\nLet's analyze why other options are incorrect:\n\n* **(A) 1 < y < 2:** This option only considers the interval between 1 and 2 and neglects the possibility of solutions where y < 1.\n* **(B) y > 2:** This option excludes the possibility of solutions where y < 1.\n* **(D) 1 \u2264 y \u2264 2:** This option includes the critical points, which do not satisfy the original inequality.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe detailed solution process involves rationalization, simplification, repeated squaring, solving a quadratic inequality, and considering domain restrictions. This approach, while tedious, ensures a complete solution to the problem and allows us to identify the correct answer as **(C) y < 1 or y > 2**. \n",
