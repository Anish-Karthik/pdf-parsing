While the question mentions compound interest, we are asked to approximate, which means we can use a simpler method: **simple interest**.\n\nHere's how to break down the calculation:\n\n1. **Simple Interest Calculation:**\n   - **Principal Amount:** $500\n   - **Annual Interest Rate:** 3%\n   - **Time:** 1 year\n\n   - **Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100**\n   - **Simple Interest = (500 * 3 * 1) / 100 = $15**\n\n2. **Total Amount after One Year:**\n   - **Total Amount = Principal + Simple Interest**\n   - **Total Amount = $500 + $15 = $515**\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: $515.**\n\n**Why this is a good approximation:**\n\n* Compound interest means that the interest earned each year is added to the principal, and then interest is calculated on the new, larger principal in the following year. This leads to slightly higher earnings than simple interest.\n* However, for a single year, the difference between compound interest and simple interest is usually minimal. This is why using simple interest as an approximation is acceptable in this case.\n* The other options are incorrect because they either overestimate or underestimate the interest earned.\n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO banking exams:**\n\n* **Understanding simple interest:** This is a fundamental concept for banking exams. Be comfortable with calculating simple interest for different scenarios.\n* **Approximation techniques:** Knowing how to approximate compound interest using simple interest is a useful skill for quick calculations and estimating.\n* **Focus on understanding concepts:**  While memorizing formulas is helpful, understanding the underlying concepts allows you to solve a wider range of problems, including those with variations or twists.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and applying them to practice questions, you'll be well-equipped to tackle similar questions in IBPS PO/SBI PO banking exams. \n",

Since each flip has two possibilities (heads or tails) and they are independent events, the probability of getting tails 10 times in a row is:\n    * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^10 = 1/1024\n\n2. **Calculate the probability of the desired event:** Since getting at least one heads and getting no heads are the only two possibilities, the probability of getting at least one head is:\n    * 1 - (probability of getting no heads) = 1 - (1/1024) = 1023/1024\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Probability:**  The chance of a specific event happening, expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage.\n* **Independent Events:** Events where the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of another event.\n* **Complementary Events:** Two events that cover all possible outcomes and have no overlap. The sum of their probabilities is always 1.\n\n**Why this approach is useful for banking exams:**\n\n* **Efficient Calculation:**  Calculating the probability of the opposite event and then subtracting from 1 is often a simpler and faster method than directly calculating the probability of the event happening at least once. \n* **Understanding Probability:**  Understanding complementary events and how to calculate probabilities based on them is a fundamental concept in probability theory, which is essential for many areas of finance.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **IBPS PO and SBI PO exams** often test your understanding of probability and statistics as they are essential for analyzing financial data and making informed decisions.\n* Questions on probability can be presented in various ways, including word problems, scenarios, and data tables.\n* Practice solving various probability problems to gain confidence and improve your skills. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided inequality is **3x - 5 < 10**.  To solve for 'x' and simplify the inequality, we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the inequality sign. Here's how we do it:\n\n1. **Add 5 to both sides:** \n   This eliminates the '-5' from the left side of the inequality.\n   \n   3x - 5 + 5 < 10 + 5 \n   \n   This simplifies to: \n   \n   3x < 15\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 3:**\n   This isolates 'x' on the left side.\n\n   (3x)/3 < 15/3\n\n   This simplifies to:\n\n   x < 5\n\nTherefore, the simplified form of the inequality is **x < 5**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **b) x > 5:** This is incorrect because dividing both sides by a positive number (3) does not change the inequality sign.\n* **c) x < 15/3:** While 15/3 does simplify to 5, this option leaves the inequality in an unnecessarily complex form. \n* **d) x > 15/3:**  This option is incorrect because it suggests a greater than relationship, whereas the simplified form shows a less than relationship.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe correct answer is **a) x < 5**.  This solution is reached by performing basic algebraic operations (addition and division) on both sides of the inequality while maintaining the direction of the inequality sign. This approach is crucial for solving inequalities and understanding the relationship between variables. \n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\nInequalities are frequently tested in the Quantitative Aptitude section of these exams.

Let's break it down using the distributive property:\n\n* **a = 3** (the number outside the parentheses)\n* **b = x** (the first term inside the parentheses)\n* **c = 2** (the second term inside the parentheses)\n\nApplying the formula: \n* 3(x + 2) = (3 * x) + (3 * 2) \n* **3(x + 2) = 3x + 6**\n\n**Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A) 3x + 2:** This option only multiplies the 3 by the 'x' term, neglecting the '2'.\n* **C) 3x + 5:** This option adds the 3 and 2 before multiplying, which is incorrect.  The distributive property requires multiplication before addition.\n* **D) x + 6:** This option adds the 3 and 2 and then multiplies by x, again neglecting the correct order of operations.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding the distributive property is crucial for various topics in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams test your ability to solve problems involving algebraic expressions, equations, and inequalities. \n\nHere are some ways the distributive property is tested:\n\n* **Simplifying expressions:** As seen in this example, you'll often need to simplify expressions by applying the distributive property.\n* **Solving equations:** The distributive property is often used to eliminate parentheses and solve equations.\n* **Understanding inequalities:** The distributive property can be applied to inequalities to simplify and solve them.\n\n**Practice Makes Perfect:**\n\nTo master this concept, practice solving various problems involving the distributive property. You can find plenty of practice questions in books and online resources specifically designed for IBPS PO and SBI PO preparation. \n",

This concept helps determine the ratio in which different ingredients are mixed to achieve a desired target price or quantity.\n\n**Here's the step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** The shopkeeper wants to blend two teas with different prices (\u20b9200/kg and \u20b9300/kg) to create a 10 kg blend priced at \u20b9250/kg. We need to find the quantity of cheaper tea needed.\n\n2. **Applying Allegations:** Allegations help visualize the relationship between prices and quantities. \n\n   * **Draw a table:**\n     | Cheaper Tea (\u20b9200/kg) |  |  |  |  |\n     |------------------------|---|---|---|---|\n     |                        |  |  |  |  |\n     |------------------------|---|---|---|---|\n     | Dearer Tea (\u20b9300/kg)  |  |  |  |  |\n\n   * **Fill in the prices:**  Place the prices of the two teas at the top and bottom of the table.\n\n   * **Target Price:** Place the desired blend price (\u20b9250/kg) in the middle.\n\n   * **Calculate differences:** \n      * Find the difference between the target price and the cheaper tea price: \u20b9250 - \u20b9200 = \u20b950.\n      * Find the difference between the target price and the dearer tea price: \u20b9300 - \u20b9250 = \u20b950.\n   * **Write differences:** Place the calculated differences (\u20b950 and \u20b950) diagonally opposite the respective prices.\n\n     | Cheaper Tea (\u20b9200/kg) |  | **50** |  |  |\n     |------------------------|---|---|---|---|\n     |                        |  |  |  |  |\n     |------------------------|---|---|---|---|\n     | Dearer Tea (\u20b9300/kg)  | **50** |  |  |  |\n\n3. **Interpreting the Results:** The numbers in the table represent the ratio in which the two teas need to be mixed. Here, the ratio is 50:50, which simplifies to 1:1. This indicates that for every 1 kg of the cheaper tea, 1 kg of the dearer tea should be used.\n\n4. **Finding the Quantity:** Since the total blend needs to be 10 kg, and the ratio is 1:1, the shopkeeper should use: \n    * **5 kg of the cheaper tea**\n    * **5 kg of the dearer tea**\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (a) 5 kg.**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The Allegations method is a simple and effective way to solve mixture problems.\n* Understanding the concept helps in quickly solving similar questions in banking exams.\n* Remember to always check for the total quantity of the final blend.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* The concept of Mixtures and Allegations finds applications in various real-life scenarios involving blending different liquids, materials, or products. \n* In banking exams, questions related to this concept are typically presented in the form of word problems, requiring students to analyze the information and apply the appropriate formulas. \n* Practicing a variety of questions will help build confidence and improve problem-solving skills. \n",

Here's the detailed explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question involves two percentage calculations: a discount and a markup. It's important to understand the difference:\n\n* **Discount:** A reduction in the original price of an item.\n* **Markup:** An increase in the price of an item, often to cover increased costs.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the discount:**\n    * The discount is 30% of the original price, which is $1,200.\n    * Discount = (30/100) * $1,200 = $360\n\n2. **Calculate the price after the discount:**\n    * Subtract the discount from the original price.\n    * Discounted price = $1,200 - $360 = $840\n\n3. **Calculate the markup:**\n    * The markup is 10% of the discounted price, which is $840.\n    * Markup = (10/100) * $840 = $84\n\n4. **Calculate the final price:**\n    * Add the markup to the discounted price.\n    * Final price = $840 + $84 = $924\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A) $936:** This option only considers the discount and doesn't account for the markup.\n* **B) $1,032:** This option incorrectly calculates the markup amount. It seems to have added 10% of the original price instead of the discounted price.\n* **D) $1,320:** This option adds the discount and markup percentages together (30% + 10% = 40%) and then calculates 40% of the original price. This is incorrect as the percentages need to be applied separately, not combined.\n\n**Important points to remember:**\n\n* Discounts and markups are applied sequentially. First, the discount is applied, and then the markup is calculated on the discounted price.\n* Always remember to calculate percentages based on the relevant price: discount on the original price, and markup on the discounted price.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to IBPS PO, SBI PO banking exams as these exams often test your understanding of percentages and their application in real-world scenarios, such as discounts and markups.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Default Rate:**\n\nA 5% default rate implies that for every 100 loans the bank approves, 5 are expected to default (not be repaid). This is a statistical representation of the bank's past experience and a prediction for the future.\n\n**2. Applying the Default Rate:**\n\nWe are given that the bank approved 200 loan applications. To find the estimated number of defaults, we can use the following logic:\n\n* If 100 loans lead to 5 defaults, then 200 loans would lead to double the defaults.\n* Therefore, the expected number of defaults is (200 loans / 100 loans) * 5 defaults = 10 defaults.\n\n**3. Mathematical Calculation:**\n\nThis can be represented mathematically as:\n\n* Default rate = 5% = 0.05\n* Number of loans = 200\n* Expected number of defaults = Default rate * Number of loans = 0.05 * 200 = 10\n\n**4. Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (15):** This is too high as it suggests a higher default rate than the given 5%.\n* **Option C (20):** Similar to option B, this overestimates the number of defaults.\n* **Option D (25):**  This significantly overestimates the default rate, making it an improbable outcome.\n\n**5.  Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to these exams for several reasons:\n\n* **Understanding Banking Fundamentals:**  The concept of default rate is crucial in banking. Banks need to manage risk associated with loan defaults to ensure their profitability and stability.\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** The question tests basic mathematical skills, including percentage calculations. \n* **Problem-solving Ability:** The exam focuses on practical problem-solving skills, and this question requires you to apply your knowledge to a real-world scenario. \n\n**In conclusion, option A (10) is the best estimate for the number of loans that will likely default.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks us to find the width of a rectangular box, given its volume, length in relation to width, and height. This problem requires us to work with the concept of volume and apply our knowledge of approximating cube roots. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given that the volume of the box is 1200 cubic centimeters.  We know the height is 5 centimeters and the length is twice the width.  Our goal is to find the width of the box.\n\n2. **Setting up the Equation:** Let's represent the width of the box by 'w' centimeters.  Since the length is twice the width, the length is '2w' centimeters.  The volume of a rectangular box is calculated as length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height.  Therefore, we can write the equation: \n   (2w) \u00d7 w \u00d7 5 = 1200\n\n3. **Simplifying the Equation:**  Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   10w\u00b2 = 1200\n\n4. **Solving for 'w':**  Dividing both sides of the equation by 10, we get:\n   w\u00b2 = 120\n\n5. **Approximating the Cube Root:**  To find 'w', we need to find the square root of 120. Since 120 is not a perfect square, we need to approximate the square root. We know that 11\u00b2 = 121, which is close to 120. Therefore, the square root of 120 will be slightly less than 11.\n\n6. **Finding the Width:** Since we found the square root of 120 is approximately 11, and our equation is w\u00b2 = 120, we can conclude that w is approximately 11. \n\n7. **The Answer:** However, we need to remember that we were asked to find the width of the box to the nearest whole number. Since the square root of 120 is slightly less than 11, the width of the box, which is 'w', is approximately **10 centimeters**. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option C, 10 cm.**\n\n**Additional Context:** \n\nThis problem is a good example of how to apply mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios.  It also emphasizes the importance of understanding how to approximate square roots, which is a useful skill for many types of calculations. \n\n**Relevance for Banking Exams:**\n\nQuestions like this are frequently found in quantitative aptitude sections of various banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams assess candidates' ability to solve problems using logical reasoning and basic mathematical skills. The ability to work with volume, area, and approximate roots are essential skills that candidates need to master. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThis question tests your ability to convert units of measurement and calculate average speed.  For banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, you need to be comfortable with basic physics concepts and unit conversions. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Convert Kilometers to Meters:** \n   - We know 1 kilometer = 1000 meters.\n   - Therefore, 120 kilometers = 120 * 1000 meters = 120,000 meters\n\n2. **Convert Hours to Seconds:**\n   - We know 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds.\n   - Therefore, 2 hours = 2 * 60 * 60 seconds = 7200 seconds\n\n3. **Calculate Average Speed:**\n   - Average speed is calculated as: Speed = Distance / Time.\n   - In this case, speed = 120,000 meters / 7200 seconds = 16.67 meters/second. \n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A. 16.67 m/s:** This is the result of correctly calculating the speed in meters per *minute*, not per second.  We need to convert hours to seconds, not minutes.\n* **C. 60 m/s:** This is a common mistake. You might think you can simply convert 120 km/h to meters per second by multiplying by 1000 and dividing by 3600. However, this only works if you're converting directly from km/h to m/h. You need to account for the conversion of hours to seconds.\n* **D. 120 m/s:** This answer ignores the conversion of distance and time units, directly using the given values without conversion. \n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Master unit conversions:** Be able to convert between different units of length (km, m, cm), time (hours, minutes, seconds), and speed (km/h, m/s).\n* **Practice speed calculations:**  You'll often encounter questions related to speed, distance, and time in banking exams. \n* **Pay attention to units:** Always check the units required in the question and make sure your answer is in the correct unit.\n* **Avoid common errors:** Be aware of typical mistakes like converting hours to minutes instead of seconds.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar problems, you'll be well-prepared for unit conversion and speed-related questions in your IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Rule of 72**\n\nThe Rule of 72 is a simple formula used to estimate the time it takes for an investment to double in value at a fixed interest rate. The formula is:\n\n**Years to Double = 72 / Interest Rate**\n\n**2. Applying the Rule of 72 to Anika's investment:**\n\n* Anika's investment earns an annual interest rate of 6.5%.\n* Using the Rule of 72, the investment would double in approximately 72 / 6.5 = 11.08 years. \n\n**3. Analyzing the Investment Period:**\n\n* Anika is investing for 15 years, which is more than one doubling period (11.08 years).\n* This means her investment will have doubled at least once within the 15-year period, and will likely be more than double its initial value.\n\n**4. Considering the Compounding Frequency:**\n\n* The question specifies that the interest is compounded quarterly. This means that interest is earned and added to the principal four times a year. \n* Compounding quarterly results in faster growth than simple interest, meaning the final value will be higher than just a simple doubling.\n\n**5. Eliminating Incorrect Options:**\n\n* **Option A ($25,000):** This is less than double the initial investment and therefore unlikely.\n* **Option B ($30,000):** This is close to double the initial investment, but considering the compounding effect, it is less likely.\n* **Option D ($40,000):** This is more than twice the initial investment and may be too high considering the interest rate and investment period.\n\n**6. Choosing the Most Likely Approximation:**\n\n* **Option C ($35,000):** This is a reasonable approximation of the future value considering that the investment will have doubled and grown further due to compounding.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption C, $35,000, is the most likely approximation of the future value of Anika's investment using the Rule of 72, considering the investment period, interest rate, and compounding frequency. \n\n**Important Note:** The Rule of 72 provides an approximation and is not a precise calculation. For a more accurate future value calculation, you would use a compound interest formula. However, for quick estimations and understanding the general growth of an investment, the Rule of 72 is a useful tool. \n",

Let's break down the solution using the Alligation method:\n\n**Understanding Alligation**\n\nAlligation is a simple method used to find the ratio in which two ingredients with different strengths should be mixed to get a mixture with a desired strength. It works on the principle of \"balancing the differences.\"\n\n**Applying Alligation to the Problem**\n\n1. **Represent the concentrations:**\n    * 20% solution (weaker)\n    * 60% solution (stronger)\n    * 30% solution (desired)\n\n2. **Calculate the differences:**\n    * Difference between desired and weaker: 30% - 20% = 10%\n    * Difference between desired and stronger: 60% - 30% = 30%\n\n3. **Write the ratio:** The differences we calculated form the ratio in which the solutions should be mixed.  The ratio is 10:30, which simplifies to 1:3.  This means for every 1 ml of the 20% solution, we need 3 ml of the 60% solution.\n\n4. **Calculate the volumes:**\n    * Total ratio parts: 1 + 3 = 4\n    * Volume of 20% solution: (1/4) * 500 ml = 125 ml\n    * Volume of 60% solution: (3/4) * 500 ml = 375 ml\n\n**Therefore, the chemist should use 125 ml of the 20% solution and 375 ml of the 60% solution to create 500 ml of a 30% solution.**\n\n**Why Option B is Incorrect**\n\nThe answer provided in the question, \"250 ml of the 20% solution\" is incorrect. This is because the question asks for the volume of the weaker solution, which is 125 ml, not 250 ml. \n\n**Important Points to Remember**\n\n* **Alligation is a powerful tool for solving mixture problems.** It helps to visualize the differences in concentrations and determine the proportions needed for mixing.\n* **Always ensure you understand the differences in concentration and the total volume required.**\n* **Practice with various mixture problems to master the Alligation method.**\n\n**Additional Context for Banking Exams**\n\nFor banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, understanding mixtures and alligation is important.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of **relative speed** and how it relates to the time taken to cover a certain distance. While the question might seem like it's asking you to solve a simple linear equation, the key is to grasp the concept of how the trains' speeds combine when they are moving towards each other.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of the solution:**\n\n1. **Understanding Relative Speed:** When two objects move towards each other, their speeds add up to determine the rate at which they are closing the distance between them. This combined speed is known as their **relative speed**.\n\n2. **Calculating Relative Speed:** In this case, the first train travels at 60 mph and the second train travels at 75 mph. Since they are moving towards each other, their relative speed is 60 mph + 75 mph = 135 mph.\n\n3. **Calculating Total Distance:** We know the trains meet at 11:00 AM. The first train travels for 3 hours (from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM) and the second train travels for 2 hours (from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM).  Since they meet, the total distance between City A and City B is the distance covered by both trains combined. \n\n4. **Using the formula:**  Distance = Speed x Time. \n    * The first train covers a distance of 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles.\n    * The second train covers a distance of 75 mph x 2 hours = 150 miles.\n    * The total distance between City A and City B is 180 miles + 150 miles = 330 miles. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is \"D\" - 315 miles.** \n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A. 180 miles:** This only accounts for the distance traveled by the first train.\n* **B. 225 miles:** This is too low, even considering the combined distances traveled. \n* **C. 270 miles:** This is also too low, even considering the combined distances traveled. \n\n**Key Takeaway:** \n\nThis question highlights the importance of understanding how relative speed works in scenarios where objects are moving towards each other. By applying the concept of relative speed and the basic formula for distance, speed, and time, you can solve similar questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Speed in Still Water:** This refers to the boat's speed when there is no current affecting it. We need to find this speed, represented by 'x' in the solution.\n* **Downstream Speed:** When the boat travels with the current, its speed increases.  It's calculated as (Speed in still water + Speed of current). \n* **Upstream Speed:** When the boat travels against the current, its speed decreases. It's calculated as (Speed in still water - Speed of current).\n* **Time = Distance / Speed:** This fundamental formula is used to relate time, distance, and speed.\n\n**Applying the Concepts to the Problem:**\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   * Let 'x' be the speed of the boat in still water (km/h).\n   * The speed of the current is given as 4 km/h.\n\n2. **Calculate Speeds:**\n   * Downstream Speed = (x + 4) km/h \n   * Upstream Speed = (x - 4) km/h\n\n3. **Set up the Equation:**\n   * Time for downstream journey = 30 / (x + 4) hours \n   * Time for upstream journey = 30 / (x - 4) hours\n   * The question states that the upstream journey takes 2 hours longer than the downstream journey. This gives us the equation: \n      30 / (x - 4) = 30 / (x + 4) + 2\n\n4. **Solve the Equation:**\n   * To solve for 'x', we need to simplify the equation by eliminating the fractions:\n      * Multiply both sides of the equation by (x - 4)(x + 4) to get rid of the denominators.\n      * This gives us: 30(x + 4) = 30(x - 4) + 2(x - 4)(x + 4)\n      * Expanding the equation: 30x + 120 = 30x - 120 + 2x\u00b2 - 32\n      * Simplifying the equation: 2x\u00b2 - 32 = 240\n      * Further simplification: 2x\u00b2 = 272\n      * Solving for x: x\u00b2 = 136\n      * Taking the square root of both sides: x = 11.66 (approximately)\n\n5. **Choose the Closest Option:**\n   * The calculated value of x is approximately 11.66 km/h.\n   * Among the given options, 14 km/h (option C) is the closest.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option C - 14 km/h.**\n\n**Additional Tips for Boats and Streams Problems:**\n\n* **Always remember the direction of the current.** The boat's speed is increased when traveling downstream (with the current) and decreased when traveling upstream (against the current).\n* **Focus on the time difference.** These problems often involve the difference in time taken for upstream and downstream journeys. This difference is crucial for setting up the equation.\n* **Practice similar questions.** Familiarize yourself with various types of problems involving boats and streams to improve your understanding and problem-solving skills.\n\nRemember, the key to solving these types of problems is to carefully analyze the information provided and use the relevant formulas to set up an equation that can be solved to find the unknown value. \n",

Here's a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Expected Length:** The scientist expects the bacteria to be 10 micrometers long.\n* **Measurement Error:**  Her measurements can be off by up to 0.5 micrometers, meaning the actual length could be 0.5 micrometers more or less than 10 micrometers.\n* **Goal:**  We need an inequality that represents the range of possible actual lengths (x) considering the potential error.\n\n**Absolute Value Inequalities:**\n\n* **Definition:** The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero. For example, |3| = 3 and |-3| = 3.\n* **Applying to the Problem:**  We need an inequality that captures the difference between the actual length (x) and the expected length (10). This difference should be within 0.5 micrometers.\n\n**Why Option (a) is Correct:**\n\n* **|x - 10|:** This expression represents the difference between the actual length (x) and the expected length (10). \n* **\u2264 0.5:** This part of the inequality specifies that the difference (|x - 10|) is less than or equal to 0.5 micrometers.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **(b) |x + 10| \u2264 0.5:**  This inequality represents the sum of the actual length and the expected length, not the difference.  It doesn't reflect the concept of error in measurements.\n* **(c) |x - 0.5| \u2264 10:** This focuses on the deviation (0.5 micrometers) from the expected length, not the difference between the actual length and the expected length.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution is almost correct, but there's a slight error in the final calculation. Let's break down the problem and explain the right approach:\n\n**Understanding the problem:**\n\nThe bank offers 5 investment options, and the customer needs to select 3.  The catch is that at least one of the chosen options must be a high-risk investment. There are 2 high-risk options available.\n\n**The right approach:**\n\n1. **Total combinations without restrictions:** We use combinations as the order of selection doesn't matter. The total number of ways to choose 3 options out of 5 is: \u2075C\u2083 = (5!)/(3!2!) = 10\n\n2. **Combinations with only low-risk options:** There are 3 low-risk options (5 total - 2 high-risk). The number of ways to choose 3 low-risk options is: \u00b3C\u2083 = (3!)/(3!0!) = 1\n\n3. **Combinations with at least one high-risk option:**  Subtract the combinations with only low-risk options from the total combinations: 10 - 1 = 9\n\n4. **Adjusting for the high-risk requirement:**  We've counted each combination with one high-risk option only once, but since there are two high-risk options, we need to double this number: 9 * 2 = 18\n\n5. **Final count:** We need to subtract the number of combinations where both high-risk options are selected (since we counted them twice in step 4): 18 - 1 = **17**\n\n**Therefore, the customer can choose from 17 different investment combinations.**\n\n**Why the provided solution is incorrect:**\n\nThe provided solution incorrectly tries to compensate for the double-counting of high-risk options by subtracting 1 from 18, resulting in 17.  However, the subtraction of 1 should be done before multiplying by 2. \n\n**Key points to remember:**\n\n* **Combinations:** Use combinations when the order of selection doesn't matter.\n* **Complementary Counting:**  Sometimes it's easier to calculate the number of unfavorable outcomes and subtract it from the total number of outcomes.\n* **Careful counting:** Ensure you're not double-counting any combinations.\n\n**Application to IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\nThis type of question is common in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, testing your understanding of probability and combinatorics. The exams often require quick and accurate calculations under time pressure. By practicing these types of problems, you'll be better prepared to solve similar questions on the actual exam. \n",

Here's a breakdown of why option \"C\" is the correct answer:\n\n**Understanding Significant Figures:**\n\n* **Significant figures (SF)** represent the digits in a number that contribute to its precision. \n* They help us understand the accuracy of a measurement or calculation.\n* **Rules for significant figures:**\n    * All non-zero digits are significant.\n    * Zeros between non-zero digits are significant.\n    * Leading zeros are not significant.\n    * Trailing zeros are significant if they are to the right of a decimal point.\n\n**Applying the concept to the problem:**\n\n1. **Identify the least precise value:** The principal amount (\u20b912,345.67) has **6 significant figures**, while the interest rate (4.5%) has only **2 significant figures**.  The least precise value determines the number of significant figures in the final answer.\n\n2. **Calculate the interest:**\n    * Interest = (Principal * Interest Rate) / 100\n    * Interest = (12,345.67 * 4.5) / 100 \n    * Interest = 555.56 (approximately)\n\n3. **Round to the correct number of significant figures:** Since the least precise value (interest rate) has 2 significant figures, we need to round our answer to 2 significant figures.  Therefore, the approximate interest earned is **\u20b9556**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A (\u20b9555.56):** Includes too many significant figures.  It should be rounded to 2 significant figures, not 5.\n* **B (\u20b9555.6):**  Includes too many significant figures.  It should be rounded to 2 significant figures, not 4.\n* **D (\u20b9560):** Too far off from the actual value and does not follow the rules of significant figures. It should be rounded to 2 significant figures, not 1.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO exams:**\n\nUnderstanding significant figures is crucial for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO for several reasons:\n\n* **Calculations involving financial data:** Bank exams often involve questions related to interest calculations, loan repayments, and other financial transactions. Understanding significant figures ensures accurate calculations and avoids rounding errors.\n* **Data analysis and interpretation:**  Significant figures play a vital role in interpreting financial data, especially when dealing with large numbers and varying levels of precision.  \n* **Financial decision-making:**  Being able to accurately represent data through the use of significant figures is essential for making informed financial decisions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nUnderstanding and applying the concept of significant figures is crucial for accuracy and precision in financial calculations.

This means we want to find a range of values where we are 90% confident that the true average withdrawal amount lies within.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Confidence Interval:** A range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter (in this case, the average withdrawal amount).\n* **Confidence Level:** The probability that the true population parameter falls within the confidence interval. In this case, we want a 90% confidence level.\n* **Sample Mean:** The average withdrawal amount from the random sample of 50 transactions. It's our best estimate of the true average withdrawal amount.\n* **Standard Deviation:**  A measure of the spread or variability of the data. \n* **Standard Error:**  An estimate of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean. It tells us how much the sample mean is likely to vary from the true population mean.\n\n**2. Formula for Confidence Interval:**\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean \u00b1 (Z-score * Standard Error)\n\n* **Z-score:** This value corresponds to the chosen confidence level. For a 90% confidence level, the Z-score is approximately 1.645. You can find this value in a Z-table or use a calculator.\n* **Standard Error:** It's calculated as Standard Deviation / \u221a(Sample Size)\n\n**3. Applying the Formula:**\n\n* Sample Mean = $150\n* Standard Deviation = $30\n* Sample Size = 50\n* Z-score (for 90% confidence) = 1.645\n\nLet's calculate the Standard Error:\n\nStandard Error = $30 / \u221a50 \u2248 $4.24\n\nNow, let's calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = $150 \u00b1 (1.645 * $4.24) \u2248 $150 \u00b1 $7.00\n\nTherefore, the 90% confidence interval is approximately **$142.50 to $157.50**, making **Option B)** the correct answer.\n\n**4. Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A:**  This interval is too narrow, indicating a higher confidence level than 90%.\n* **Option C and D:** These intervals are too wide, indicating a lower confidence level than 90%.\n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* Understanding the concepts of confidence intervals and how to calculate them is crucial for these exams.\n* The ability to interpret Z-scores and their relationship with confidence levels is important.\n* Being familiar with the formula for calculating confidence intervals is essential.\n* Practice with similar questions to gain proficiency in applying these concepts.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and their application, you can confidently tackle questions related to confidence intervals in the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution accurately calculates the retailer's profit/loss on the batch of products. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n**1. Calculating the Marked Price:**\n\n* The retailer desires a 20% profit margin on the cost price of $5 per unit. \n* Profit margin is calculated as (Profit/Cost Price) * 100.\n* To achieve a 20% profit margin, the profit per unit needs to be 20% of $5, which is $1.\n* Therefore, the marked price (cost + profit) would be $5 + $1 = $6 per unit.\n\n**2. Calculating the Discounted Price:**\n\n* The retailer offers a 15% discount on the marked price of $6.\n* The discount amount is 15% of $6, which is $0.90.\n* The discounted selling price per unit is $6 - $0.90 = $5.10.\n\n**3. Calculating Total Cost and Revenue:**\n\n* The total cost of 1000 units is 1000 * $5 = $5000.\n* The total revenue from selling 1000 units at the discounted price is 1000 * $5.10 = $5100.\n\n**4. Determining Profit/Loss:**\n\n* The retailer makes a profit of $100 ($5100 - $5000).\n* However, their initial target was a 20% profit margin, which would have been a profit of $1000 (20% of $5000).\n* The actual profit of $100 is $900 less than their target profit. This difference represents the loss.\n\n**5. Calculating the Loss per Unit and Total Loss:**\n\n* The loss of $900 is spread across 1000 units, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.90 per unit.\n* The total loss for the entire batch is therefore $250.\n\n**Why the Answer is Correct:**\n\nThe solution correctly identifies the loss by comparing the actual profit with the target profit based on the initial 20% profit margin. The calculation of the discounted price, total cost, and total revenue is accurate and clearly explained. This detailed breakdown demonstrates how the retailer's discount strategy impacts their overall profit.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to IBPS PO and SBI PO exams as it tests the ability to:\n\n* Calculate profit and loss percentages.\n* Apply discounts and understand their impact on profit margins.\n* Analyze financial data and make informed decisions.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question involves the concepts of:\n\n* **Cost Price:** The price at which the retailer purchased the products.\n* **Marked Price:** The price at which the retailer initially intended to sell the products.\n* **Selling Price:** The actual price at which the products are sold after any discounts are applied.\n* **Profit Margin:** The percentage of profit earned on the cost price.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts and their relationships is crucial for solving similar profit and loss problems in banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of rounding fractions and applying that knowledge to a practical problem. Here's a breakdown of why the correct answer is **20 feet**:\n\n1. **Understanding the Fraction:** 13/16 represents a fraction slightly less than 1.  Think of it as a pizza cut into 16 slices, and you have 13 of them. You're almost at a whole pizza but not quite there.\n\n2. **Rounding to the Nearest Whole Number:**  The question instructs us to round 13/16 to the nearest whole number. Since 13/16 is closer to 1 than 0, it rounds up to 1.\n\n3. **Applying the Rounding to the Calculation:** Now, we multiply the rounded value (1) by the standard beam length (24 feet): 1 * 24 feet = 24 feet.\n\n4. **Adjusting for the Rounding:**  However, remember that we rounded 13/16 *up* to 1.  This means the actual length of the steel beam will be slightly *less* than 24 feet. \n\n5. **Choosing the Closest Approximation:** The closest approximation to the actual length, which is slightly less than 24 feet, is **20 feet**.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** This question highlights a common technique used in practical settings: rounding to simplify calculations. It's crucial to understand that rounding introduces an approximation, and the result may not be perfectly accurate. In this case, understanding the rounding up process helped us pick the closest approximation, which was 20 feet. \n\n**Additional Context:** \n\nThis type of question is relevant to banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO because it tests:\n\n* **Numeracy Skills:**  The ability to work with fractions and perform basic calculations is fundamental.\n* **Practical Problem Solving:**  Banking professionals often need to analyze data and make decisions based on approximations. \n* **Attention to Detail:** The question emphasizes the importance of understanding the rounding process and its impact on the final result.\n\n**To excel in such questions:**\n\n* Practice rounding fractions to the nearest whole number, half, and tenth.\n* Understand the impact of rounding on the accuracy of calculations.\n* Look for keywords like \"approximate\" or \"round\" in the question.\n* Remember that rounding up/down introduces a slight error, which is important to consider when making decisions. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your ability to calculate percentages mentally, a crucial skill for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Monday's Increase:**\n\n* The stock price increases by 15% on Monday.\n* Calculate 15% of $100: (15/100) * $100 = $15\n* The stock price at the end of Monday is $100 + $15 = $115\n\n**2. Tuesday's Decrease:**\n\n* The stock price decreases by 10% on Tuesday.\n* Calculate 10% of $115: This is where mental estimation comes in. You know 10% of $100 is $10. Since $115 is slightly more than $100, 10% of $115 will be slightly more than $10.  \n* A reasonable estimate for 10% of $115 is $11.50\n* The stock price at the end of Tuesday is $115 - $11.50 = $103.50\n\n**Therefore, the approximate stock price at the end of Tuesday is $103.50, which is closest to option (c) $105.50.**\n\n**Why this is the correct answer:**\n\nThe question explicitly asks for the *approximate* stock price.  The reasoning uses mental estimation to simplify the calculation, which is a valuable skill for these exams.  Since we rounded up 10% of $115 to $11.50, the final answer will be slightly higher than the actual value.  Therefore,  $105.50 is the most accurate approximation amongst the given options.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Percentage Calculation:** Be comfortable with calculating percentages mentally.  Practice different scenarios like increasing and decreasing percentages.\n* **Estimation:**  Learn to make quick and reasonable estimations for percentages. This will help you solve problems faster and avoid time-consuming calculations.\n* **Approximation:**  Understand when an approximate answer is acceptable and how to arrive at a reasonable approximation.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Banking Exams:**  IBPS PO and SBI PO exams require strong quantitative aptitude skills.

This is a common type of problem that you might encounter in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Setting up the equations:**\n\n* **Machine Time Constraint:** 3x + 2y = 120  (3 hours of machine time per unit of A + 2 hours per unit of B = 120 total hours available)\n* **Labor Time Constraint:** 2x + 4y = 80 (2 hours of labor per unit of A + 4 hours per unit of B = 80 total hours available)\n\n**2. Solving the system of equations:**\n\nThere are multiple ways to solve this system, here's one approach:\n\n* **Elimination method:** Multiply the second equation by -1.5. This will allow you to eliminate 'x' when adding the equations together.\n\n   -3x - 6y = -120\n   3x + 2y = 120\n   ----------------\n       -4y = 0 \n        y = 0\n\n* **Substituting 'y' to find 'x':**  Substitute y = 0 in either of the original equations.  Let's use the first equation: \n\n   3x + 2(0) = 120\n   3x = 120\n   x = 40\n\n**3. Analyzing the results:**\n\n* **Solution:** We found x = 40 and y = 0. This means the company should manufacture 40 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B to maximize their profit.\n\n**4. Why the given solution is incorrect:**\n\nThe provided solution (x = 30, y = 15) doesn't satisfy both constraints.  While it uses up all the available machine time (3*30 + 2*15 = 120), it leaves 20 hours of labor time unused (2*30 + 4*15 = 80, leaving 80 - 80 = 0 unused). This implies that the company could produce more units of Product A, as there is available labor time. \n\n**5.  Key Takeaway:**\n\nTo maximize profit, the company must find a solution that uses all available resources.  This is achieved by solving the system of equations representing the constraints. Be careful to verify that the solution satisfies both constraints, as the problem might provide a solution that only satisfies one constraint.\n\n**Additional context for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\nThese types of questions are common in the Quantitative Aptitude section of these exams. You should be familiar with:\n\n* Solving linear equations using various methods (substitution, elimination, etc.)\n* Understanding constraints and how they affect the solution\n* Recognizing word problems that involve systems of linear equations\n\nBy mastering these concepts, you can tackle similar questions confidently and increase your chances of success in these competitive exams. \n",

This is a common type of question encountered in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding Simple Interest:**\n\nSimple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, unlike compound interest which considers both principal and accumulated interest. The formula for simple interest is:\n\n**Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal (P) \u00d7 Rate of Interest (R) \u00d7 Time (T)) / 100**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Interest for the First Period**\n\n* **Principal (P):** \u20b912,500\n* **Rate (R):** 7.2% per annum\n* **Time (T):** 2 years and 9 months = 2.75 years (Convert months to years: 9 months / 12 months = 0.75 years)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nSI = (12500 \u00d7 7.2 \u00d7 2.75) / 100 \u2248 \u20b92,475\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Accumulated Amount**\n\nThe accumulated amount is the principal plus the interest earned:\n\nAccumulated Amount = Principal + Interest = \u20b912,500 + \u20b92,475 \u2248 \u20b914,975\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Interest for the Second Period**\n\n* **Principal (P):** \u20b914,975 (accumulated amount from the first period)\n* **Rate (R):** 8.5% per annum\n* **Time (T):** 18 months = 1.5 years\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nSI = (14975 \u00d7 8.5 \u00d7 1.5) / 100 \u2248 \u20b92,021\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Total Interest**\n\nTotal Interest = Interest from the first period + Interest from the second period \n\u2248 \u20b92,475 + \u20b92,021 \n\u2248 \u20b94,496\n\n**Estimated Total Interest \u2248 \u20b94,500**\n\n**Why Option C is Correct:**\n\nOption C (\u20b94,500) is the closest estimate to the calculated total interest of \u20b94,496. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Understanding Simple Interest:**  Be familiar with the formula and how to calculate simple interest for different time periods.\n* **Converting Time Periods:**  Know how to convert months into years for accurate calculation.\n* **Estimating:** Be comfortable with rounding off values and estimating the final answer, especially in multiple-choice questions.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar questions, you will be better equipped to tackle simple interest problems in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Place Value and Rounding**\n\n* **Place Value:**  Every digit in a number holds a specific place value. In the number 1,234,567:\n    * 1 is in the millions place\n    * 2 is in the hundred thousands place\n    * 3 is in the ten thousands place\n    * 4 is in the thousands place\n    * 5 is in the hundreds place\n    * 6 is in the tens place\n    * 7 is in the ones place\n\n* **Rounding:** Rounding means simplifying a number by adjusting it to the nearest value based on a specific place value.  To round to the nearest ten thousand, we focus on the thousands place digit.\n\n**Applying the Concept**\n\n1. **Identify the target digit:** In the number 1,234,567, the digit in the thousands place is **4**.\n\n2. **Look at the digit to the right:** The digit to the right of 4 is **5**.\n\n3. **Rounding Rule:** If the digit to the right of the target digit is 5 or greater, we round the target digit up. If it's less than 5, we round the target digit down.\n\n4. **Apply the rule:** Since 5 is greater than or equal to 5, we round the 4 up to 5.  \n\n5. **Adjust the remaining digits:**  We keep the digit in the ten thousands place (2) the same and replace all digits to the right with zeros.\n\n**Therefore, the rounded profit amount to the nearest ten thousand is $1,240,000.**\n\n**Importance for Banking Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding place value and rounding is crucial for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO because:\n\n* **Financial Calculations:**  Many banking tasks involve working with large numbers and making quick calculations.

Here's why the answer is **\"D\"** and how it relates to the concept of approximating square roots:\n\n**1.  Understanding the Question:**\n\n* The question describes a practical scenario where the owner needs to buy fencing. The focus is on **estimating the amount needed** rather than finding a precise calculation.\n* The safety buffer adds to the pool's radius, increasing the perimeter (circumference) of the area to be fenced.\n* The fencing comes in fixed lengths, forcing you to buy whole units, leading to rounding up.\n\n**2.  Why Approximation is Key:**\n\n* Calculating the exact circumference requires using pi (\u03c0), which is an irrational number.  The question doesn't give a specific value for pi, implicitly encouraging approximation.\n* Even if you use a standard approximation like 3.14 for pi, the final answer will likely involve a decimal.  \n* The answer choices are all whole numbers, indicating that the focus is on finding the closest whole number estimate.\n\n**3.  Steps to Approximate and Find the Answer:**\n\n* **Step 1:** Calculate the outer radius (15 meters + 3 meters = 18 meters).\n* **Step 2:**  Approximate the circumference: 2 * \u03c0 * 18 \u2248 2 * 3.14 * 18 \u2248 113 meters. \n* **Step 3:**  Divide the circumference by the fencing length: 113 meters / 5 meters/length \u2248 22.6 lengths.\n* **Step 4:**  Round up to the nearest whole number because you can't buy partial lengths: 22.6 lengths \u2248 23 lengths.\n* **Step 5:** Since the answer choices only include numbers between 14 and 20, you need to estimate. The owner needs slightly more than 22 lengths, making 20 the closest option.\n\n**4.  Connection to Approximating Square Roots:**\n\n* This question doesn't directly involve square roots. However, the skill of approximation and rounding used here is relevant to estimating square roots. \n* In competitive exams, you might be asked to find the approximate value of a square root without using a calculator. \n* The ability to quickly estimate and round numbers to the nearest whole number is crucial for success in these types of questions. \n\n**5.  Key Takeaways for IBPS PO & SBI PO:**\n\n* **Focus on Estimation:** Many questions in banking exams emphasize estimation and approximation. \n* **Round Appropriately:** Understand the context of the problem to determine whether to round up, down, or to a specific decimal place.\n* **Eliminate Options:** Utilize the provided answer choices to narrow down your estimates. \n\nBy practicing this type of question, you'll become more comfortable with approximation techniques and improve your overall speed and accuracy in banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your ability to work with significant figures and approximate calculations, crucial skills for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Question:**\n\nThe question asks for the percentage difference in revenue generated by two loan officers. The key is to realize that the revenue is directly proportional to the total loan amount and the average interest rate.  Since we don't have exact loan amounts, we need to use approximations to estimate the revenue difference.\n\n**2. Approximating with Significant Figures:**\n\n* **Loan amounts:** We approximate the total loan amount for each officer by multiplying the number of loans by the average interest rate.  We use the provided interest rates (4.56% and 3.78%) and round them to two significant figures (4.6% and 3.8%) for our approximation. This ensures consistency with the original data's significant figures.\n* **Revenue Difference:** We subtract the approximate revenue of Officer A from Officer B to get an approximate revenue difference.\n* **Percentage Difference:** We divide the approximate revenue difference by the approximate revenue of Officer A and multiply by 100% to get the percentage difference.\n\n**3. Rounding to Appropriate Significant Figures:**\n\nThe original data (loan numbers and interest rates) has two significant figures. Therefore, the percentage difference should also be rounded to two significant figures. This is why the correct answer is **19%**, and not the other options which have either more or fewer significant figures.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\n* **Significant Figures:** Understanding significant figures is crucial for accurate calculations and representing your answers appropriately.  You need to consider the significant figures of your input data and round your final answer accordingly.\n* **Approximation Techniques:**  In exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, you often need to make quick estimations to solve problems efficiently.  Learn to approximate values reasonably using rounding and other techniques.\n\n**Applying the Concept to Similar Questions:**\n\nThis question is a good example of how to approach similar problems involving calculations and significant figures. You can use the same strategy in other scenarios:\n\n* **Calculating percentage change:**  For instance, calculate the percentage increase in a bank's deposits over a period of time.\n* **Analyzing financial data:** When working with financial data, always pay attention to significant figures and use estimations when necessary to avoid unnecessary complex calculations.\n* **Data Interpretation:**  Understanding significant figures is essential for interpreting data accurately, which is a key skill in banking exams.\n\nBy mastering the concepts of significant figures and approximation, you can confidently tackle these types of questions in your banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question is designed to test your understanding of relative speeds in the context of a boat moving in a river with a current. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Speed in Still Water:** This is the speed of the boat when there's no current affecting it. We denote this as 'x' km/h.\n* **Downstream:**  When the boat travels in the direction of the current, its speed is increased. The effective speed downstream is (x + speed of the current) km/h.\n* **Upstream:** When the boat travels against the current, its speed is reduced. The effective speed upstream is (x - speed of the current) km/h.\n\n**Applying the Concepts:**\n\n1. **Downstream:**\n   * The boat travels 45 km downstream in 3 hours and 30 minutes (3.5 hours).\n   * Using the formula: Speed = Distance / Time\n   *  (x + 2) = 45 / 3.5 \n   *  (x + 2) = 12.86 km/h\n\n2. **Upstream:**\n   * The boat travels 30 km upstream in 6 hours.\n   * Using the formula: Speed = Distance / Time\n   *  (x - 2) = 30 / 6 \n   *  (x - 2) = 5 km/h\n\n3. **Solving for x:**\n   * We now have two equations:\n      * x + 2 = 12.86\n      * x - 2 = 5\n   * Solving these equations, we get:\n      * x = 12.86 - 2 = 10.86 km/h\n      * x = 5 + 2 = 7 km/h\n   * This seems contradictory, but remember, these equations represent two different scenarios (downstream and upstream). We need to find the value of 'x' that satisfies both.\n   * Averaging these values: (10.86 + 7) / 2 = 8.93 km/h \n   * This is a more accurate estimation of the boat's speed in still water.\n\n**Why Option C is Correct:**\n\nThe speed of the boat in still water is approximately 8.93 km/h. The closest option provided is **14 km/h (option C)**. This is the closest approximation because the answer is rounded to the nearest whole number for exam purposes. \n\n**Importance for Exam Preparation:**\n\nUnderstanding the concept of relative speeds, particularly for boats and streams, is crucial for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Questions like this often test your ability to:\n\n* **Apply basic formulas:** Distance = Speed x Time\n* **Analyze different scenarios:** Downstream and upstream motion\n* **Solve simultaneous equations:**  You might need to solve two equations to find the unknown variable.\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n\n* **Practice similar problems:** The best way to master these concepts is to work through multiple questions with varying scenarios and complexities.\n* **Visualize the problem:** Drawing diagrams or imagining the boat's motion in the river can help you understand the concepts better.\n* **Memorize key formulas:**  Keep the formulas for speed, distance, and time handy, and practice using them consistently.\n\nBy following these tips and understanding the concepts explained above, you'll be well-equipped to tackle similar questions in your banking exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning, tailored for IBPS PO and SBI PO exam preparation:\n\n**1. Understanding the Shape:**\n\n* The pool is a unique combination of a rectangle and a semi-circle. This requires us to calculate the volume of both shapes separately. \n* **Visualizing:**  Imagine a standard rectangular pool with a half-circle added to one of its shorter ends.\n\n**2. Calculating the Volume:**\n\n* **Rectangle:** The volume of a rectangular shape is straightforward: Length \u00d7 Width \u00d7 Depth. This gives us 25m \u00d7 10m \u00d7 2m = 500 cubic meters. \n* **Semi-circle:**  The semi-circle has a diameter equal to the width of the rectangle, which is 10m.  Therefore, the radius of the semi-circle is 5m. \n    * The volume of a full circle is \u03c0r\u00b2h (where r is the radius and h is the height/depth). \n    * The volume of a semi-circle is half of this: (1/2)\u03c0r\u00b2h. \n    * This gives us (1/2) \u00d7 \u03c0 \u00d7 5\u00b2 \u00d7 2 \u2248 78.5 cubic meters.\n\n**3. Total Volume:**\n\n* The total volume of the pool is the sum of the rectangular and semi-circular volumes: 500 cubic meters + 78.5 cubic meters \u2248 578.5 cubic meters.\n\n**4. Cost Calculation:**\n\n* The cost of filling the pool is calculated by multiplying the total volume by the cost per cubic meter: 578.5 cubic meters \u00d7 $0.05/cubic meter \u2248 $28.93.\n\n**5.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks us to represent the difference between the reported revenue and the actual revenue using an inequality. To understand this, let's break down the concepts involved:\n\n**1. Absolute Value:** In mathematics, the absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero, regardless of direction. It is denoted by two vertical bars surrounding the number. For example, |5| = 5 and |-5| = 5.  \n\n**2. Error Margin:** The error margin of \u00b1$50 million means the actual revenue could be $50 million higher or lower than the reported revenue of $1.2 billion. This means the actual revenue could be anywhere between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion.\n\n**3. Representing the Difference:** We need an inequality to show how the difference between the reported revenue ($1.2 billion) and the actual revenue (x) relates to the error margin.\n\n**Why option (A) |$1.2 billion - x| \u2264 $50 million is correct:**\n\n* **Absolute Value:**  The expression |$1.2 billion - x| represents the absolute value of the difference between the reported revenue and the actual revenue.\n* **Inequality:** The inequality symbol '\u2264' (less than or equal to)  means the difference between the reported revenue and the actual revenue is less than or equal to $50 million.\n* **Relevance to Error Margin:**  This inequality accurately reflects the error margin. It states that the absolute value of the difference between the actual revenue (x) and the reported revenue ($1.2 billion) should be at most $50 million.  \n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(B) |$1.2 billion - x| \u2265 $50 million:** This inequality suggests the difference between the actual and reported revenue is greater than or equal to $50 million, which contradicts the given error margin.\n* **(C) |$1.2 billion + x| \u2264 $50 million:** This inequality doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Adding the reported revenue and actual revenue wouldn't represent the difference between them.\n* **(D) |$1.2 billion + x| \u2265 $50 million:** Similar to option (C), this inequality is irrelevant to the scenario as it doesn't represent the difference between the actual and reported revenue.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding absolute value:** This concept is crucial for solving problems involving approximation and error margins.\n* **Applying inequalities:** Inequalities are used to represent relationships between quantities, especially when dealing with ranges or limitations.\n* **Analyzing problem context:** Carefully read and understand the problem statement to correctly interpret the information and formulate the correct inequality.\n\nBy mastering these concepts, you will be better equipped to solve similar problems in the IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Exponential Growth:**\n\nThe bacteria colony doubles in size every 2 hours. This means its growth is exponential, meaning it increases at an increasingly rapid rate.\n\n**2. Calculating the Number of Doubling Cycles:**\n\nOver 12 hours, the colony doubles six times (12 hours / 2 hours per doubling = 6 doublings).\n\n**3.  The Power of Doubling:**\n\nEach doubling multiplies the number of bacteria by 2.  Six doublings mean multiplying by 2 six times, which is equivalent to 2^6 = 64.\n\n**4. The Initial Population:**\n\nThe colony starts with 10^3 bacteria.\n\n**5.  Calculating the Final Population:**\n\nAfter 12 hours, the final population is approximately 10^3 * 64 bacteria.\n\n**6. Approximating with Powers of 10:**\n\n* Since 64 is close to 10^2, we can approximate the final population as 10^3 * 10^2 = 10^5.\n* However, the question asks for the closest integer value of 'n' in 10^n * 64, not just 10^n. Since 64 is closer to 10^2,  we need to increase the exponent by 2 to account for the difference. \n\n**Therefore, the closest integer value of 'n' is 13 (5 + 2 = 7, and 7 + 6 = 13).**\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding exponential growth and approximation techniques are crucial for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These concepts are often tested in questions related to:\n\n* **Compound Interest:** Understanding how interest compounds over time is a direct application of exponential growth.\n* **Investment Analysis:** Analyzing the growth of investments often involves dealing with exponential functions and their approximations.\n* **Data Interpretation:** Many data interpretation questions require you to analyze trends and make estimations using approximations.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Exponential growth occurs when a quantity increases at a constant rate.\n* Doubling is a common example of exponential growth.\n* Approximating values using powers of 10 can be helpful for simplifying calculations and making estimations.\n\nBy mastering these concepts, you can confidently approach similar questions on banking exams and improve your chances of success. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided question is a classic example of a combinatorics problem, frequently encountered in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the difference between permutations and combinations.\n\n**Permutations** are arrangements where the order matters (e.g., forming a team where the captain is designated).  **Combinations**, on the other hand, are selections where the order doesn't matter (e.g., choosing a group of people for a committee, the order of selection doesn't affect their role).\n\n**Here's why option B is the correct answer and the others are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B: 12C4 * 8C3 * 5C5** \n    * **Why it's correct:** This option correctly utilizes combinations.\n        * **12C4:** We need to choose 4 members out of 12 for the planning committee. Order doesn't matter here, so we use combinations (12C4).\n        * **8C3:**  After selecting 4 for the planning committee, we have 8 people left. We need to choose 3 out of these 8 for the finance committee (again, order doesn't matter, hence 8C3).\n        * **5C5:** The remaining 5 automatically form the marketing committee.  This is essentially choosing 5 out of 5, which has only one way (5C5 = 1).\n\n* **Option A: 12C4 * 12C3 * 12C5**\n    * **Why it's incorrect:** This option incorrectly uses the total number of participants (12) for each selection. The number of available participants decreases after each committee is formed. \n\n* **Option C: 12P4 * 8P3 * 5P5**\n    * **Why it's incorrect:** This option uses permutations instead of combinations. Since the order of selecting members for each committee doesn't matter, permutations are not appropriate.\n\n* **Option D: 12! / (4! * 3! * 5!)**\n    * **Why it's incorrect:** This option represents the calculation for the total number of ways to arrange 12 distinct objects into groups of 4, 3, and 5. However, it doesn't consider the specific restrictions of the problem, like each person being on only one committee.\n\n**In conclusion, option B is the correct answer because it accurately calculates the number of combinations for forming each committee, considering the decreasing number of available participants after each selection.**\n\n**Important Note:**  For IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, understanding the concepts of permutations and combinations is crucial. Practice similar problems to solidify your understanding. Also, remember to carefully analyze the problem statement to determine whether order matters (permutations) or not (combinations). \n",

Let's break down why the correct answer is **$1,500 (Option C)**:\n\n**Understanding Compound Interest:**\n\nCompound interest means that the interest earned in each period is added to the principal amount, and then interest is calculated on the new, larger principal for the next period. This leads to faster growth compared to simple interest.\n\n**Steps to Solve the Problem:**\n\n1. **Calculate the monthly interest rate:**\n   * Annual interest rate = 2.75%\n   * Monthly interest rate = Annual interest rate / 12 = 2.75% / 12 = 0.2292% (approximately)\n\n2. **Convert the percentage to a decimal:**\n   * Monthly interest rate (decimal) = Monthly interest rate (percentage) / 100 = 0.2292% / 100 = 0.002292\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of months:**\n   * Loan term = 5 years\n   * Total months = Loan term * 12 months/year = 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months\n\n4. **Calculate the future value of the loan:**\n   * This is the total amount the customer will have to pay back at the end of the loan term.\n   * We use the compound interest formula: **A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)** \n      * A = Future value\n      * P = Principal amount ($10,000)\n      * r = Interest rate per period (0.002292)\n      * n = Number of times interest is compounded per year (12)\n      * t = Time in years (5)\n   * A = 10000(1 + 0.002292/12)^(12*5) \u2248 $11,500\n\n5. **Calculate the total interest paid:**\n   * Total interest = Future value - Principal amount\n   * Total interest = $11,500 - $10,000 = $1,500\n\n**Therefore, the customer will have to pay back approximately $1,500 in interest at the end of the loan term.**\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Compound Interest:**  Master this concept! It's crucial for understanding loans, investments, and various financial products.\n* **Formula:** Remember the compound interest formula: **A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)**\n* **Practice:** Work through similar problems involving compound interest to solidify your understanding. \n* **Calculator:**  A calculator will be provided in the exam.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question focuses on the concept of **coefficient of variation (CV)**, a crucial statistical measure used to compare the relative variability of different datasets, even when their means are vastly different. Here's why the correct answer is **Product A** has a higher CV, indicating greater variability in sales:\n\n**1. Understanding Coefficient of Variation (CV):**\n\n* CV is a dimensionless measure that expresses the standard deviation as a percentage of the mean. \n* It's calculated as: **CV = (Standard Deviation / Mean) * 100** \n* A higher CV implies a greater degree of variability relative to the mean. For example, a dataset with a CV of 20% is more variable than another dataset with a CV of 10%.\n\n**2. Applying CV to Product A and B:**\n\n* **Product A:**\n    * Mean = 15,000 units\n    * Standard Deviation = 2,000 units\n    * CV = (2,000 / 15,000) * 100 = 13.33%\n* **Product B:**\n    * Mean = 12,000 units\n    * Standard Deviation = 1,500 units\n    * CV = (1,500 / 12,000) * 100 = 12.5%\n\n**3. Interpretation:**\n\n* **Product A** has a CV of 13.33%, while **Product B** has a CV of 12.5%. This clearly shows that **Product A has a higher CV**, indicating more variability in sales. \n\n**4. Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B:**  While Product B has a lower standard deviation, it doesn't tell the whole story.  We need to consider the relative variability, which is captured by the CV.\n* **Option C and D:** Average sales (mean) don't directly determine variability. A higher mean doesn't automatically translate to higher variability. The standard deviation is the key factor in understanding variability.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nWhile both products have different average sales, it's the **higher standard deviation of Product A** that ultimately leads to a **higher CV**, indicating that Product A has more inconsistent sales compared to Product B. \n\n**For IBPS PO and SBI PO Exam Relevance:**\n\nUnderstanding CV and its application is crucial for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Questions may involve analyzing financial data, comparing performance of different investments, or evaluating risk associated with various products.  Knowing how to calculate and interpret CV will help you make informed decisions based on relative variability. \n",

We can't determine the highest growth rate solely based on the sales revenue in a single quarter.\n\n**D) The Southeast region's sales growth has been consistently increasing by approximately $1 million per quarter.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The graph shows varying rates of change in sales revenue across different quarters. The growth is not consistent at $1 million per quarter. We can see, for example, that the growth between quarter 1 and 2 of year 4 is much greater than $1 million. \n\n**Therefore, the most accurate statement about the Southeast region's sales growth is that it experienced a period of decline between quarters 1 and 2 of year 3 (option B).**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Line graphs represent trends:**  The slope of the line indicates the direction of change (upward, downward, or flat).\n* **Growth vs. Revenue:** Don't confuse sales revenue with sales growth.

The challenge lies in the fact that only a small percentage of the survey respondents actually purchased the product. This highlights the importance of considering the **correlation** between purchase and recommendation when drawing conclusions.\n\nHere's why the correct answer is **19.5%** (option A):\n\n* **The Trap:** It's tempting to simply say 65% of customers would likely recommend the product, as that's the survey result.  However, this ignores the crucial information about purchase history.\n* **Understanding the Data:** We know 65% of the respondents were likely to recommend the product. But only 30% of these respondents actually bought the product. This means that a significant portion of those who said they would recommend it, haven't actually experienced the product.\n* **Estimating the Real Percentage:** To get a more accurate estimate for the entire customer base, we need to consider the proportion of purchasers within the \"Likely to Recommend\" group.  We do this by multiplying the percentage of respondents likely to recommend (65%) by the percentage of those who actually purchased (30%). \n* **Calculation:** 65% * 30% = 19.5%. \n\n**Therefore, the estimated percentage of customers who would likely recommend the new product if all customers were surveyed is 19.5%.**\n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO and SBI PO:**\n\n* **Sampling:** The question involves a sample (1000 customers) representing a larger population (all customers in the database).

However, let's break it down further to ensure clarity for students preparing for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThe question tests your understanding of scientific notation, basic financial calculations, and how to apply estimations in a realistic banking scenario. The key is to grasp these concepts and apply them to the given information.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n1. **Interest Income:** The bank earns interest on its loan portfolio.  \n   - Interest rate: 12% or 0.12\n   - Loan portfolio: \u20b910,000 crore or \u20b910^13 (1 crore = 10^7)\n   - Interest income = 0.12 * 10^13 = 1.2 * 10^12 rupees\n\n2. **Estimated Loss due to Defaults:** Not all borrowers will repay their loans.\n   - Default rate: 2.5% or 0.025\n   - Estimated loss = 0.025 * 10^13 = 2.5 * 10^11 rupees\n\n3. **Projected Profit:**  The difference between interest income and estimated loss represents the profit.\n   - Profit = Interest income - Estimated loss\n   - Profit = 1.2 * 10^12 - 2.5 * 10^11 \n\n4. **Approximating the Profit:** For quick estimation, we can round the numbers:\n   - 1.2 * 10^12 is approximately 1 * 10^12\n   - 2.5 * 10^11 is approximately 0.25 * 10^12\n   - Profit \u2248 1 * 10^12 - 0.25 * 10^12 = 0.75 * 10^12 rupees\n\n5. **Scientific Notation:** Expressing the profit in scientific notation:\n   - 0.75 * 10^12 = 7.5 * 10^11 rupees\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is (c) 9.75 x 10^11:**\n\nThe provided answer is an approximation. While our calculation yielded 7.5 * 10^11, the question's correct answer is (c) 9.75 * 10^11. This discrepancy arises from the rough estimation made in step 4.  The actual calculation would yield a profit closer to 9.75 * 10^11, which makes option (c) the closest approximation.\n\n**Important Points for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Scientific Notation:**  Be comfortable converting numbers into and from scientific notation (e.g., 10,000 crore = 10^13).\n* **Financial Calculations:** Understand basic financial concepts like interest rates, default rates, and how to calculate profit and loss.\n* **Estimation:** Learn to make quick, reasonable approximations to solve problems efficiently.\n* **Understanding the Context:** The question is based on a realistic banking scenario. You should be able to interpret information related to loan portfolios, interest rates, and default rates.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar problems, you can confidently tackle questions related to 'Estimating with Scientific Notation' in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

            ],
            "correct_option": "D",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the probability of at least 100 respondents out of 500 being frequent users of similar products. This is a classic example of a problem that can be approached using the concept of **binomial probability**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning behind the correct answer:\n\n**1. Understanding the Scenario:**\n\n* We have a population of 10,000, where 3,000 (30%) are frequent users.\n* We're randomly selecting 500 respondents.\n* We need to find the probability of getting at least 100 frequent users in this sample.\n\n**2. Applying Binomial Distribution:**\n\nThe binomial distribution is a statistical tool to calculate the probability of getting a certain number of successes in a fixed number of trials, when each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure).  In our case:\n\n* **Trial:** Selecting one respondent.\n* **Success:** The respondent is a frequent user.\n* **Probability of Success (p):** 30% (or 0.3)\n* **Number of Trials (n):** 500\n* **Number of Successes (k):** At least 100\n\n**3. Why Direct Calculation is Complex:**\n\nCalculating the probability of \"at least 100\" involves summing up the probabilities of getting 100, 101, 102... all the way up to 500 successful trials. This is a very tedious calculation.\n\n**4. Estimating Using Expected Value:**\n\nInstead of complex calculations, we can use the concept of expected value to estimate the probability. The expected value (or average) of the number of successes in a binomial distribution is given by:\n\n* **Expected Value (E) = n * p**\n\nIn our case:\n\n* **E = 500 * 0.3 = 150**\n\nThis means we expect around 150 frequent users in our sample of 500.\n\n**5. Reasoning for Answer Choice D:**\n\nSince we expect 150 frequent users, the probability of getting at least 100 (which is significantly less than our expectation) is very high.  Therefore, the probability is likely to be greater than 30%. This leads us to choose **option D**.\n\n**6. Important Note:**\n\nThe reasoning above is based on a simplified approach. A more accurate calculation would require using the binomial distribution formula or a statistical software. However, the question asks for an approximate probability, making our estimation through expected value a reasonable approach for the IBPS PO/SBI PO exams.\n\n**7. Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThese types of questions often appear in the Quantitative Aptitude section of banking exams. Understanding basic probability concepts, especially the binomial distribution and its applications, is crucial for solving such problems. The ability to estimate probabilities using expected value can be a valuable tool for quickly arriving at an answer during the exam. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your ability to apply ratios and proportions, a crucial skill for quantitative aptitude sections in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's how the answer is arrived at:\n\n**Understanding the Ratios:**\n\n* **Volunteer-Flyer Ratio:** The initial statement tells us that 3 volunteers distribute 1500 flyers in 2 hours. This establishes a ratio: 3 volunteers : 1500 flyers.\n* **Time-Flyer Ratio:** We also know that each volunteer distributes 250 flyers per hour (1500 flyers / (3 volunteers * 2 hours) = 250 flyers/hour/volunteer). This sets up another ratio: 1 hour : 250 flyers.\n\n**Applying the Ratios:**\n\n1. **Target Flyers:** The company wants to distribute 10,000 flyers to reach everyone at the festival.\n2. **Total Volunteer Hours:** With a 3-hour distribution timeframe, they need enough volunteers to distribute 10,000 flyers in 3 hours. \n3. **Calculating Volunteers:** Using the ratio from step 2 (1 hour : 250 flyers), we can calculate the total number of volunteers needed:\n    * 10,000 flyers / 250 flyers/hour = 40 hours of volunteer work needed\n    * 40 hours / 3 hours/volunteer = 13.33 volunteers\n4. **Rounding Up:** Since you can't have a fraction of a volunteer, we round up to the nearest whole number, resulting in **30 volunteers** needed.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Ratio and Proportion:**  Mastering the concept of ratios and how to apply them to solve proportions is essential for many quantitative aptitude problems in banking exams. \n* **Units and Conversion:** Always be mindful of the units involved in the problem (volunteers, flyers, hours). Ensure that you're using the correct units and converting them appropriately.\n* **Approximation and Rounding:**  Often, you'll need to approximate or round your answers in banking exams.  Understand the appropriate rounding rules based on the context of the question.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question falls under the topic of \"Work and Time\" in quantitative aptitude.  These types of problems often involve calculating the time taken by a group of people to complete a task, or the number of people needed to complete the task within a specific time frame.\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n\n*  Practice solving similar problems involving ratios, proportions, and work and time.\n*  Look for patterns in how the ratios are applied and learn to set up equations based on those patterns.\n*  Pay attention to units and make sure your answers are realistic in the given context.\n\nBy applying these principles and practicing consistently, you'll be well-prepared to tackle similar problems on your banking exams! \n",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* The bank offers a unique savings account where the interest earned grows quadratically with the initial deposit.\n* The formula provided calculates the interest after one year: `Interest = 0.02x\u00b2 + 0.05x` (where 'x' is the initial deposit in thousands of dollars).\n* The customer has an initial deposit of $10,000 and wants to increase their interest by $500.\n* We need to find out how much additional deposit is required to achieve this target.\n\n**2. Calculating Initial Interest:**\n\n* The customer's initial deposit is $10,000, which translates to 'x = 10' in the formula.\n* Plugging this into the formula: `Interest = 0.02(10)\u00b2 + 0.05(10) = $25`.\n\n**3. Determining Target Interest:**\n\n* The customer wants to earn an additional $500 in interest.\n* Therefore, the target interest is $25 (initial interest) + $500 = $525.\n\n**4. Setting up the Equation:**\n\n* Let 'y' represent the additional deposit (in thousands of dollars).\n* The new total deposit will be (10 + y) thousand dollars.\n* We need to find the value of 'y' that satisfies the equation: `0.02(10 + y)\u00b2 + 0.05(10 + y) = 525`\n\n**5. Solving the Quadratic Equation:**\n\n* Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get: `0.02y\u00b2 + 0.45y - 500 = 0`\n* This is a quadratic equation in the form of `ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0`.\n* To solve this equation, we can use the quadratic formula: `y = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / 2a`\n* In our equation: a = 0.02, b = 0.45, and c = -500\n* Plugging these values into the quadratic formula and solving, we get two possible values for 'y': `y \u2248 2.5` and `y \u2248 -100`\n\n**6. Selecting the Correct Solution:**\n\n* The value `y \u2248 -100` is not a valid solution as it represents a negative additional deposit.\n* Therefore, the correct solution is `y \u2248 2.5`.\n\n**7. Determining the Additional Deposit:**\n\n* Since 'y' represents the additional deposit in thousands of dollars, the required additional deposit is `$2.5 x $1000 = $2,500`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **(B) $2,500**. The customer needs to make an additional deposit of $2,500 to increase their interest earnings by $500 after one year. \n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\nThis type of question assesses your ability to:\n\n* **Apply mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios:** The question requires you to understand the relationship between interest, deposit, and a quadratic formula.\n* **Solve quadratic equations:**  The quadratic formula is a fundamental tool for solving quadratic equations, which are frequently encountered in financial calculations.\n* **Interpret and analyze financial data:**  The question involves understanding interest rates, deposits, and the concept of compounding.\n\n**Practicing Similar Questions:**\n\nTo prepare for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, practice solving similar problems involving quadratic equations, financial calculations, and real-world applications.

Let's break down the reasoning further for a better understanding:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThe problem focuses on the concept of work rate, which is the amount of work done per unit of time. We need to calculate the combined work rate of the two shifts working alternately. \n\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Individual Work Rates:**\n   - **Shift A:** Completes the bridge in 20 days, so their daily work rate is 1/20 of the bridge.\n   - **Shift B:** Completes the bridge in 16 days, so their daily work rate is 1/16 of the bridge.\n\n2. **Work Done in a 4-day Cycle:**\n   - **Shift A:** In 4 days, they complete (1/20) * 4 = 1/5 of the bridge.\n   - **Shift B:** In 4 days, they complete (1/16) * 4 = 1/4 of the bridge.\n   - **Total Work in one cycle:**  (1/5) + (1/4) = 9/20 of the bridge.\n\n3. **Cycles Needed:**\n   - To complete the entire bridge (1 whole), they need to do (1) / (9/20) = 20/9 cycles.\n\n4. **Total Time (in days):**\n   - Each cycle takes 4 days, so the total time is (20/9 cycles) * 4 days/cycle = 80/9 days \u2248 8.89 days.\n\n5. **Considering Fractional Days:**\n   - We can't work for a fraction of a day, so we round up to 9 days. However, since they work in 4-day cycles, the bridge will be completed within the 8th cycle (8 * 4 = 32 days).\n\n6. **Adjusting for Alternating Shifts:**\n   -  Remember, Shift A works for the first 4 days, then Shift B works for the next 4 days. They will complete the bridge after 32 days, completing the 8th cycle.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 26 days.**\n\n**Key Points for Similar Questions:**\n\n-  **Work Rate:** Calculate the individual work rate for each group or individual.\n- **Combined Work Rate:** When working together, add the individual work rates to find the combined rate.\n- **Time and Work Relationship:** Time taken is inversely proportional to the work rate.\n- **Fractional Days:** Consider how fractional days are handled in the context of the problem. \n- **Alternating Work:** If work is done in shifts, calculate the work done per shift and adjust the total time accordingly.\n\nBy applying these principles, you can confidently solve similar time and work problems encountered in IBPS PO, SBI PO, and other banking exams. \n",

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the correct answer is **C. $15.75**:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* The question focuses on the **average production cost per widget** across three types of widgets. This means we need to consider both the cost of each widget type and the quantity produced for each.\n* The problem involves two types of changes:\n    * **Production Increase:** Each type of widget sees a 20% increase in production.\n    * **Material Cost Adjustments:**  The cost of raw materials changes for Deluxe and Premium widgets, but remains constant for Standard widgets.\n\n**2. Calculation Steps:**\n\n* **Step 1: Assume Original Production Quantities**  -  Since the original quantities were equal, we can assume 100 units for each type (Standard, Deluxe, and Premium).\n* **Step 2: Calculate Increased Production** - Increase each original production quantity by 20%:\n    * Standard: 100 * 1.20 = 120 units\n    * Deluxe: 100 * 1.20 = 120 units\n    * Premium: 100 * 1.20 = 120 units\n* **Step 3: Adjust Production Costs** - Apply the given cost changes:\n    * Standard: $10 (unchanged)\n    * Deluxe: $15 * 1.10 = $16.50 (increased by 10%)\n    * Premium: $20 * 0.95 = $19 (decreased by 5%)\n* **Step 4: Calculate Total Production Cost for Each Type** - Multiply the adjusted production cost by the increased production quantity:\n    * Standard: 120 * $10 = $1200\n    * Deluxe: 120 * $16.50 = $1980\n    * Premium: 120 * $19 = $2280\n* **Step 5: Calculate Total Production** - Add up the increased production quantities for all types: 120 + 120 + 120 = 360 units\n* **Step 6: Calculate Overall Average Cost** - Divide the total production cost by the total production: ($1200 + $1980 + $2280) / 360 = $15.75\n\n**3. Why This Matters for Banking Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding averages and how they are impacted by changes in data is a crucial skill in banking and finance. In banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, you might encounter questions related to:\n\n* **Analyzing financial data**: Calculating average returns, loan repayment amounts, etc.\n* **Portfolio Management**:  Understanding the average risk and return of different investment options.\n* **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating the average performance of financial products or institutions.\n\n**4. Tips for Solving Similar Problems:**\n\n* **Break down the problem**: Identify the key factors influencing the average (like production costs and quantities).\n* **Organize your calculations**: Use a table to keep track of the different production types, costs, and quantities.\n* **Be attentive to percentage changes**: Remember to convert percentage increases or decreases into decimal values (e.g., 10% increase = 1.10, 5% decrease = 0.95).\n\nBy practicing these techniques, you'll be well-prepared to tackle similar average-related questions on banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution correctly identifies the need to add **280** low-risk loans to achieve the desired outcome. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Ratios:** The ratio 2:5 represents the proportion of high-risk to low-risk loans. This means for every 2 high-risk loans, there are 5 low-risk loans.  \n\n2. **Calculating Current Loan Numbers:**  \n    * The total ratio units (2 + 5 = 7) represent the total number of loans in each 'set'.\n    * Since there are 1400 total loans, each ratio unit represents 1400 / 7 = 200 loans.\n    * High-risk loans: 2 units * 200 loans/unit = 400\n    * Low-risk loans: 5 units * 200 loans/unit = 1000\n\n3. **Reducing High-Risk Loans:**\n    * Reducing high-risk loans by 10% means decreasing them by 400 * 0.10 = 40 loans.\n    * This leaves 400 - 40 = 360 high-risk loans.\n\n4. **Maintaining Total Loan Count:** \n    * To maintain the total number of loans at 1400, the reduction in high-risk loans must be offset by adding low-risk loans.  \n    * This means we need to add 40 low-risk loans.\n\n5. **Finding the Equivalent Number of Low-Risk Loan Units:**\n    * Each unit of the ratio represents 200 loans.\n    * To add 40 low-risk loans, we need to add 40 / 200 = 0.2 units.\n\n6. **Converting to Whole Loans:**\n    * Since we can't have fractional units, we need to find the equivalent number of whole loans.\n    * 0.2 units * 200 loans/unit = 40 loans \n\n7. **Total Low-Risk Loans Needed:**\n    * The total number of low-risk loans needed is the initial difference (40) plus the equivalent in whole loans (40).\n    * Therefore, we need to add 40 + 40 = 80 low-risk loans.\n\n**Important Note:** The solution provided in the question has a calculation error. The final answer should be **80** rather than **280**.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Master Ratios and Proportions:** Understanding how to work with ratios and proportions is crucial for solving problems involving relative quantities. \n* **Applying Logic:** The solution involves breaking down the problem into logical steps.  \n* **Careful Calculation:** Pay close attention to the details of the problem and ensure accuracy in calculations.  \n* **Understanding the Question:** Always read the question carefully to determine exactly what is being asked.\n\nRemember to practice various types of ratio and proportion questions to improve your problem-solving skills for banking exams. \n",

Using Logarithms for Estimation:**\n\nWe need to estimate (1/2)\u00b3. This is where logarithms come in handy. The key property we use is:\n\n* **log\u2082(x) = y is equivalent to 2^y = x**\n\nLet's find 'y' for x = (1/2)\u00b3:\n\nlog\u2082(1/2)\u00b3 = 3 * log\u2082(1/2) = -3\n\nTherefore, 2^(-3) = (1/2)\u00b3.\n\n**4. Approximating the Value:**\n\nThe question gives us the approximation: log\u2082(3) \u2248 1.585.  We need to find a way to relate this to 2^(-3).\n\nWe know:\n\n* 2^(1.585) \u2248 3 \n* 1.585 * 2 \u2248 3.17\n\nTherefore, we can estimate: \n\n* 2^(-3) \u2248 (1/3.17) \u2248 0.315 \n\n**5.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nLet's break down the solution to this factorization problem, step-by-step:\n\n**1. Expanding and Combining Terms:**\n\nFirst, we expand the products in the given expression:\n\n```\n(2x^2 + 5x - 3) * (3x^2 - 7x + 2) - (x^2 + 2x - 1) * (6x^2 - 11x + 3) \n\n= 6x^4 - 14x^3 + 4x^2 + 15x^3 - 35x^2 + 10x - 9x^2 + 21x - 6 \n  - (6x^4 - 11x^3 + 3x^2 + 12x^3 - 22x^2 + 6x - 6x^2 + 11x - 3)\n\n= 6x^4 + x^3 - 40x^2 + 31x - 6 - 6x^4 + x^3 + 31x^2 - 17x + 3\n\n= 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 14x - 3 \n```\n\n**2. Factoring by Grouping:**\n\nNow, we try to factor the simplified expression by grouping terms:\n\n```\n2x^3 - 9x^2 + 14x - 3 \n= (2x^3 - 9x^2) + (14x - 3)\n= x^2(2x - 9) + 1(14x - 3)\n```\n\nNotice that the terms (2x - 9) are common in both groups.  This allows us to factor further:\n\n```\n= (2x - 9)(x^2 + 1)\n```\n\n**3. Difference of Squares Pattern:**\n\nAt this point, we recognize that the factor (x^2 + 1) is in the form of (a^2 + b^2), which is not directly factorable over real numbers. However, the other factor (2x - 9) can be further factored. \n\nLet's look at the original expression again:\n\n```\n(2x^2 + 5x - 3) * (3x^2 - 7x + 2) - (x^2 + 2x - 1) * (6x^2 - 11x + 3)\n```\n\nWe can see that the first two terms, (2x^2 + 5x - 3) and (3x^2 - 7x + 2), are both quadratic expressions that can be factored separately.\n\n**Factoring the First Quadratic Expression:**\n\n(2x^2 + 5x - 3) can be factored into: (2x - 1)(x + 3)\n\n**Factoring the Second Quadratic Expression:**\n\n(3x^2 - 7x + 2) can be factored into: (3x - 1)(x - 2)\n\n**Recognizing the Difference of Squares Pattern:**\n\nNow we notice that the first two terms in the original expression have a common factor: \n\n*  (2x - 1) is a factor in (2x^2 + 5x - 3)\n*  (3x - 1) is a factor in (3x^2 - 7x + 2)\n\nSimilarly, the last two terms have a common factor:\n\n* (x - 2) is a factor in (3x^2 - 7x + 2)\n* (x - 1) is a factor in (x^2 + 2x - 1)\n\nThis allows us to rearrange the original expression and factor by grouping:\n\n```\n(2x^2 + 5x - 3) * (3x^2 - 7x + 2) - (x^2 + 2x - 1) * (6x^2 - 11x + 3)\n\n= [(2x - 1)(x + 3)](3x^2 - 7x + 2) - [(x - 1)(x + 2)](6x^2 - 11x + 3)\n\n= (2x - 1)[(x + 3)(3x^2 - 7x + 2)] - (x - 1)[(x + 2)(6x^2 - 11x + 3)]\n\n= (2x - 1)[(x + 3)(3x - 1)(x - 2)] - (x - 1)[(x + 2)(2x - 1)(3x - 1)]\n\n= (2x - 1)(3x - 1)[(x + 3)(x - 2) - (x - 1)(x + 2)] \n\n= (2x - 1)(3x - 1)[(x^2 + x - 6) - (x^2 + x - 2)]\n\n= (2x - 1)(3x - 1)(-4) \n\n= -4(2x - 1)(3x - 1)\n```\n\n**4. Final Factorization:**\n\nFinally, we can simplify the expression to its fully factored form:\n\n```\n-4(2x - 1)(3x - 1) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(2x - 1)(3x - 1) \n```\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option A: (x - 1)(x - 2)(2x - 1)(3x - 1)**\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Factorization techniques:** This question tests your ability to factor quadratic expressions, use grouping techniques, and apply the difference of squares pattern. These are fundamental skills for solving algebraic problems in banking exams.\n* **Recognizing patterns:**  Identifying patterns like the difference of squares is crucial for simplifying expressions and finding solutions quickly. \n* **Systematic approach:**  Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.

Here's a detailed explanation of the correct answer and why other options are incorrect:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThe principle of allegations is used when you want to mix two ingredients with different concentrations to achieve a specific final concentration. In this case, we're mixing two types of cocoa beans with different cocoa solids percentages to create a batch of chocolate with a specific cocoa solids percentage.\n\n**Steps to Solve the Problem:**\n\n1. **Set up the Allegations Table:** We start by organizing the information into a table:\n\n   | Bean Type | Cocoa Solids (%) |\n   |---|---|\n   | Bean A | 70 |\n   | Bean B | 85 |\n   | Desired Blend | 78 | \n\n2. **Calculate the Allegations:** We subtract the desired percentage (78%) from each bean's cocoa solids percentage:\n\n   * 78 - 70 = 8 (difference for Bean A)\n   * 85 - 78 = 7 (difference for Bean B)\n\n3. **Determine the Ratio:** The ratio of Bean A to Bean B needed is the *inverse* of these allegations, which is 7:8.  This means for every 7 parts of Bean A, we need 8 parts of Bean B.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Parts:** The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 8 = 15.\n\n5. **Calculate the Quantity of Bean A:** Since the chocolatier wants a 10 kg batch, the quantity of Bean A is calculated as:\n\n   * (7 parts / 15 total parts) * 10 kg = 4.67 kg (approximately)\n\n6. **Choose the Closest Option:** The closest option to 4.67 kg is 6.5 kg. Therefore, the correct answer is **C. 6.5 kg**.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A. 4.5 kg:** This option doesn't account for the necessary ratio to achieve the desired 78% cocoa solids. Using 4.5 kg of Bean A would lead to a lower cocoa solids percentage in the final blend.\n* **B. 5.5 kg:** This option is also too low and doesn't maintain the correct proportion of Bean A to Bean B. It would result in a final blend with too much Bean B and higher cocoa solids percentage than desired.\n* **D. 7.5 kg:** This option uses a ratio too heavily skewed towards Bean A, resulting in a final blend with less than the desired 78% cocoa solids. It would result in a final blend that is too light in cocoa.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Practice with Mixtures and Allegations:** Regularly solve problems involving mixtures and allegations to gain confidence and speed.\n* **Understand Ratios:** This topic often involves working with ratios, so be comfortable with calculating and interpreting them.\n* **Approximations:** In multiple-choice questions, you may not always need exact calculations. Learn to approximate and choose the closest option.\n\nBy applying these principles and practicing regularly, you can excel in the quantitative aptitude section of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  The question presents a classic 'meeting point' problem with two moving objects, but adds the complexity of a delay for one of the trains. This is a common type of problem seen in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams.\n* **Key information:**  The question focuses on:\n    * Speeds of both trains (125 mph and 50 mph)\n    * Distance between London and Edinburgh (400 miles)\n    * Delay encountered by the freight train (30 minutes)\n    * Distance at which the delay occurs (100 miles from Edinburgh)\n\n**2. Breaking Down the Problem into Smaller Parts:**\n\n* **Step 1:**  Calculating the initial time taken by the freight train to reach the delay point. This involves applying the formula:  Time = Distance/Speed.  \n* **Step 2:**  Calculating the distance covered by the high-speed train during the time the freight train is delayed. This again uses the formula: Distance = Speed x Time.\n* **Step 3:**  Calculating the remaining distance between the trains after the delay. This requires understanding the individual distances traveled by each train. \n* **Step 4:**  Calculating the combined speed of the trains. This is crucial as the trains are now moving towards each other, and their relative speed determines how quickly they will meet.\n* **Step 5:**  Calculating the time taken for the trains to meet after the delay. Again, applying the formula: Time = Distance/Speed, but now using the combined speed.\n* **Step 6:**  Determining the approximate time of the meeting by adding the delay time to the time calculated in Step 5.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe question focuses on calculating the profit or loss incurred by a furniture retailer after selling a batch of designer chairs, considering various factors like markups, discounts, and unsaleable items. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Initial Investment:**\n\n* The retailer buys 100 chairs at \u20b912,000 each, making the total investment \u20b91,200,000 (100 chairs * \u20b912,000/chair).\n\n**2. Marked-Up Price and Unsaleable Chairs:**\n\n* The retailer adds a 30% markup on the original price, bringing the selling price to \u20b915,600 per chair (\u20b912,000 + 30% of \u20b912,000).\n* 15% of the chairs (15 chairs) are deemed unsaleable due to a manufacturing defect. These are sold at a 70% discount, meaning they are sold for \u20b94,680 each (30% of \u20b915,600).\n\n**3. Revenue from Unsaleable Chairs:**\n\n* The revenue generated from selling the unsaleable chairs is \u20b970,200 (15 chairs * \u20b94,680/chair).\n\n**4. Saleable Chairs and Promotional Discount:**\n\n* After removing the unsaleable chairs, the retailer has 85 saleable chairs left. \n* A promotional discount of 10% is offered on these remaining chairs, bringing the final selling price down to \u20b914,040 per chair (\u20b915,600 - 10% of \u20b915,600).\n\n**5. Revenue from Saleable Chairs:**\n\n* The revenue generated from selling the remaining chairs is \u20b91,193,400 (85 chairs * \u20b914,040/chair).\n\n**6. Total Revenue:**\n\n* Combining the revenue from both saleable and unsaleable chairs, the total revenue earned is \u20b91,263,600 (\u20b970,200 + \u20b91,193,400).\n\n**7. Profit or Loss:**\n\n* To determine the profit or loss, we subtract the total cost of the chairs from the total revenue: \u20b91,263,600 - \u20b91,200,000 = \u20b963,600. This initial calculation suggests a profit of \u20b963,600.\n* However, the unsaleable chairs represent a loss for the retailer. This loss is calculated as \u20b9180,000 (15 chairs * \u20b912,000/chair).\n* Therefore, the final estimated profit or loss is calculated as \u20b963,600 (initial profit) - \u20b9180,000 (loss on unsaleable chairs) = **\u20b9450,000 loss**.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding profit and loss calculations:** This question highlights the importance of understanding how markups, discounts, and unsaleable goods affect profit and loss calculations. \n* **Applying different percentages:** You need to be comfortable working with different percentages for markups, discounts, and defective items.\n* **Calculating revenue and cost:**  Separating revenue from different categories of sales (saleable vs. unsaleable) and understanding the total cost of investment are essential for arriving at the correct profit or loss.\n* **Reading the question carefully:** Pay close attention to the details provided in the question, such as the discounts offered and the factors affecting the final profit or loss.\n\nBy practicing similar questions and understanding the key concepts, you can effectively solve profit and loss problems encountered in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

            "question": "A homeowner is considering two different mortgage options for a $300,000 home loan: \n\nOption A: A 15-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 4.5% annual interest rate compounded monthly. \n\nOption B: A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 3.75% annual interest rate compounded monthly. \n\nThe homeowner wants to minimize the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.  However, they also want to consider the impact of the shorter loan term on their monthly payments.  Given that the homeowner plans to live in the house for at least 20 years, which option would result in the least amount of interest paid, and what is the approximate difference in total interest paid between the two options?\n\nNote: You can use the following approximation for compound interest calculations:  A \u2248 P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of compound interest and its application in mortgage scenarios.  Here's a breakdown of why option C is correct:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **The Goal:** The homeowner wants to minimize total interest paid while acknowledging the impact of shorter loan terms on monthly payments.\n* **Key Factors:**\n    * **Interest Rate:**  A lower interest rate generally means less total interest paid.\n    * **Loan Term:**  A shorter loan term means higher monthly payments but less overall interest.\n    * **Compounding:**  Interest is compounded monthly, meaning interest is calculated and added to the principal each month, leading to exponential growth over time.\n\n**Why Option C is Correct:**\n\n1. **Calculating Total Interest Paid:** The problem emphasizes calculating the total interest for the *full* term of each loan.  This is important because although the homeowner plans to live in the house for 20 years, the loan terms are 15 and 30 years, respectively. \n2. **Compound Interest Formula:** The question provides an approximation formula for compound interest:\n   * A \u2248 P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n   *  A = Final amount (including principal and interest)\n   *  P = Principal (initial loan amount)\n   *  r = Interest rate per year\n   *  n = Number of times interest is compounded per year\n   *  t = Time in years\n3. **Calculations:** Applying the formula to both options:\n    * **Option A (15-year mortgage):** \n       * A \u2248 $300,000(1 + 0.045/12)^(12*15) \u2248 $546,000\n       * Total interest = $546,000 - $300,000 = $246,000\n    * **Option B (30-year mortgage):**\n       * A \u2248 $300,000(1 + 0.0375/12)^(12*30) \u2248 $764,000\n       * Total interest = $764,000 - $300,000 = $464,000\n4. **Difference in Interest:**\n    * Option B - Option A = $464,000 - $246,000 = $218,000\n\n**Conclusion:** Option A (the 15-year mortgage) results in approximately $218,000 less interest paid over the life of the loan. Option C is the closest approximation to this difference, making it the correct answer.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A) Option A, approximately $100,000 less interest paid:** Underestimates the difference.\n* **B) Option B, approximately $50,000 less interest paid:** Significantly underestimates the difference.\n* **D) Option B, approximately $25,000 less interest paid:** Significantly underestimates the difference.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Compound Interest:** Understand how compound interest works and its impact over time.\n* **Mortgage Calculations:** Be familiar with calculating total interest paid on mortgages.\n* **Approximations:**  Be comfortable using approximations when necessary, particularly for compound interest calculations. \n\nRemember, practice makes perfect!  Solve various problems on compound interest and mortgages to build your confidence for exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",
