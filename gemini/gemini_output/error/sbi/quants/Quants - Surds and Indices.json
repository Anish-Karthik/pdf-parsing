Here's a step-by-step solution: \\n\\n**1. Understanding the Inequality:**\\n\\n* The term $2^t$ represents the bacteria's natural growth rate (doubling every hour).\\n* The term $3^{t/2}$ represents the inhibiting effect of the introduced substance.\\n* The inequality $2^{t} - 3^{t/2} < 5$ indicates that the researchers are interested in the time period when the bacteria colony size is less than 5 thousand. \\n\\n**2. Solving the Inequality:** \\n\\nThis inequality cannot be solved algebraically using elementary functions. We need to employ a numerical or graphical approach to find the solution. \\n\\n* **Numerical Approach:** One could use a calculator or spreadsheet to calculate the value of the expression $2^{t} - 3^{t/2}$ for different values of 't'. By testing integer values of 't', we find:\\n    * For t = 0,  $2^{0} - 3^{0/2} = 0 < 5$ \n    * For t = 1,  $2^{1} - 3^{1/2} < 5$\n    * For t = 2,  $2^{2} - 3^{2/2} < 5$\n    * For t = 3,  $2^{3} - 3^{3/2} < 5$\n    * For t = 4,  $2^{4} - 3^{4/2} = 7 > 5$ \n\\n    We see that the inequality holds true for t = 0, 1, 2, and 3. \\n\\n* **Graphical Approach:** Graph the functions $y = 2^t$ and $y = 3^{t/2} + 5$. The solution to the inequality is the range of 't' values where the graph of  $y = 2^t$ is below the graph of $y = 3^{t/2} + 5$. This graphical analysis will also lead to the solution  0 \u2264 t < 4 (approximately). \\n\\n**3.

This means we need to show that no matter what positive rational number we choose, we can always find values for 'x' and 'y' (following the given conditions) that make the expression equal to our chosen number.\n\n  **Proof:**\n\n  1. **Let 'r' be any positive rational number.** Our goal is to show that:\n      (\u221a2 - x) / (y - \u221a2) = r  is possible for some x and y.\n\n  2. **Rearranging the equation:** \n      \u221a2 - x = r(y - \u221a2) \n      \u221a2 - x = ry - r\u221a2\n      \u221a2(1 + r) = ry + x\n\n  3. **Strategic Choices for x and y:**\n\n      *  We need to choose 'x' and 'y' such that they satisfy the given conditions (x < \u221a2  and y > \u221a2) and the equation we derived.\n      *  Notice that the left side of the equation involves \u221a2 multiplied by a rational number (1 + r).  \n      *  To simplify, let's choose 'y' such that  ry = \u221a2(1 + r). This gives us:  y = \u221a2(1 + r) / r. Since r is positive, y will be greater than \u221a2.\n      *  Substituting this value of 'y' back into the equation, we get: \u221a2(1 + r) = \u221a2(1 + r) + x. This simplifies to x = 0.\n\n  4. **Verifying our Choices:**\n\n      *  We've found that x = 0 and y = \u221a2(1 + r) / r satisfy the derived equation. \n      *  x = 0 is a rational number less than \u221a2.\n      *  Since 'r' is positive, y = \u221a2(1 + r) / r will always be a rational number greater than \u221a2.\n\n  **Conclusion:**  We have successfully demonstrated that for any positive rational number 'r', we can find values for 'x' and 'y' (adhering to the given conditions) that make the expression (\u221a2 - x) / (y - \u221a2) equal to 'r'. Therefore, the expression can represent any positive rational number.\n\n  **This question is considered tricky (8/10) because:**\n\n  * It requires a deep understanding of the properties of surds and rational numbers.\n  * Students need to strategically manipulate the equation and make smart choices for 'x' and 'y'.\n  * The proof-based nature of the question demands clear logical reasoning and mathematical rigor. \n  \"\n}\n```",

Here's a step-by-step solution: \\n\\n**1. Recognize the Conjugates:**\\nThe expression contains two fractions where the denominators are conjugates (a + \u221ab) and (a - \u221ab).\\n\\n**2. Utilize the Difference of Squares:**\\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator by multiplying the fractions by their respective conjugates:\\n\\\\begin{equation*} \\\\frac{(5 + \\\\sqrt{7})(a - \\\\sqrt{b})}{(a + \\\\sqrt{b})(a - \\\\sqrt{b})} - \\\\frac{(5 - \\\\sqrt{7})(a + \\\\sqrt{b})}{(a - \\\\sqrt{b})(a + \\\\sqrt{b})} \\\\end{equation*}\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\\\begin{equation*} \\\\frac{(5a - 5\\\\sqrt{b} + a\\\\sqrt{7} - \\\\sqrt{7b}) - (5a + 5\\\\sqrt{b} - a\\\\sqrt{7} - \\\\sqrt{7b})}{a^2 - b} \\\\end{equation*}\\n\\n**3. Simplify the Expression:**\\nNotice that several terms cancel out, leaving us with: \\n\\\\begin{equation*} \\\\frac{2a\\\\sqrt{7} - 10\\\\sqrt{b}}{a^2 - b} \\\\end{equation*}\\n\\n**4. Deduce the Integer Value:**\\nFor this expression to be a single-digit integer, the surd terms in the numerator must either cancel out or simplify to integers.  This implies that 'a' must be a multiple of 7 and 'b' must be a perfect square. The simplest possibility is a = 7 and b = 49, which gives: \\n\\\\begin{equation*} \\\\frac{2 * 7 * \\\\sqrt{7} - 10 * \\\\sqrt{49}}{7^2 - 49} = \\\\frac{14\\\\sqrt{7} - 70}{0} \\\\end{equation*}\\nThis results in division by zero, making it invalid. Therefore, we need to find another multiple of 7 for 'a' such that the denominator is not zero. Let's try a = 14 and maintain b = 49:\\n\\\\begin{equation*} \\\\frac{2 * 14 * \\\\sqrt{7} - 10 * \\\\sqrt{49}}{14^2 - 49} = \\\\frac{28\\\\sqrt{7} - 70}{147} = \\\\frac{14(2\\\\sqrt{7} - 5)}{147} = \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{7} - 5}{21} \\\\end{equation*} This still doesn't result in a single-digit integer.  We need to try a different approach.  Since simplifying the surds to integers directly seems unlikely, let's aim for their cancellation. For this, the numerator needs to be a multiple of the denominator. If we set a = 7 and b = 3 (making the denominator 46), we get:\\n\\\\begin{equation*} \\\\frac{2 * 7 * \\\\sqrt{7} - 10 * \\\\sqrt{3}}{7^2 - 3} = \\\\frac{14\\\\sqrt{7} - 10\\\\sqrt{3}}{46} \\\\end{equation*}  This doesn't simplify to a single-digit integer. Let's experiment with a = 14 and b = 12 (keeping the denominator as a factor of 147): \\n\\\\begin{equation*} \\\\frac{2 * 14 * \\\\sqrt{7} - 10 * \\\\sqrt{12}}{14^2 - 12} = \\\\frac{28\\\\sqrt{7} - 20\\\\sqrt{3}}{184} = \\\\frac{4(7\\\\sqrt{7} - 5\\\\sqrt{3})}{184} =  \\\\frac{7\\\\sqrt{7} - 5\\\\sqrt{3}}{46}\\end{equation*} This doesn't lead to a single-digit integer either.  We need to find values for 'a' and 'b' that make the numerator a multiple of 46.  After some trial and error, we find that a = 23 and b = 7 are a possible solution:\\n\\\\begin{equation*} \\\\frac{2 * 23 * \\\\sqrt{7} - 10 * \\\\sqrt{7}}{23^2 - 7} = \\\\frac{46\\\\sqrt{7} - 10\\\\sqrt{7}}{522} = \\\\frac{36\\\\sqrt{7}}{522} = \\\\frac{6\\\\sqrt{7}}{87} \\\\end{equation*}  However, this still doesn't simplify to a single-digit integer.  Since we've exhausted possibilities for canceling the surds, let's revisit simplifying them to integers.  Recall that for the surds to simplify to integers, 'a' must be a multiple of 7 and 'b' must be a perfect square. We tried a = 7 and a = 14; let's try a = 21 and b = 49: \\n\\\\begin{equation*} \\\\frac{2 * 21 * \\\\sqrt{7} - 10 * \\\\sqrt{49}}{21^2 - 49} = \\\\frac{42\\\\sqrt{7} - 70}{392} = \\\\frac{14(3\\\\sqrt{7} - 5)}{392} = \\\\frac{3\\\\sqrt{7} - 5}{28} \\\\end{equation*}  This still doesn't result in a single-digit integer. Let's try a = 28 and b = 49: \\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\\\frac{2 * 28 * \\\\sqrt{7} - 10 * \\\\sqrt{49}}{28^2 - 49} = \\\\frac{56\\\\sqrt{7} - 70}{735} = \\\\frac{14(4\\\\sqrt{7} - 5)}{735} = \\\\frac{4\\\\sqrt{7} - 5}{52}  \\end{equation*} This also doesn't result in a single-digit integer.  We need to explore other perfect squares for 'b'.  Let's try b = 196 (twice the previous value) and a = 49 (to keep the denominator a factor of 7):\\n\\\\begin{equation*} \\\\frac{2 * 49 * \\\\sqrt{7} - 10 * \\\\sqrt{196}}{49^2 - 196} = \\\\frac{98\\\\sqrt{7} - 140}{2205} = \\\\frac{14(7\\\\sqrt{7} - 10)}{2205} = \\\\frac{7\\\\sqrt{7} - 10}{157}  \\end{equation*} This doesn't simplify to a single-digit integer. Let's try b = 256 (another perfect square) and a = 56 (to maintain the denominator as a factor of 7): \\n\\\\begin{equation*} \\\\frac{2 * 56 * \\\\sqrt{7} - 10 * \\\\sqrt{256}}{56^2 - 256} = \\\\frac{112\\\\sqrt{7} - 160}{2880} = \\\\frac{8(14\\\\sqrt{7} - 20)}{2880} = \\\\frac{14\\\\sqrt{7} - 20}{360} \\end{equation*}  This still doesn't simplify to a single-digit integer.  It seems we've exhausted most likely possibilities, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to find suitable values for 'a' and 'b' that satisfy the conditions.  It's possible that the mischievous mathematician made an error, and the expression cannot be simplified to a single-digit integer. Without further information or constraints, it's challenging to determine a definitive solution.  This highlights the importance of verifying assumptions and the limitations of relying solely on trial-and-error methods.\n\"\n}\n```",
