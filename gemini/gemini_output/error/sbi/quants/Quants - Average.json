He picked 200 apples.\\n* **Overall Average:** The farmer wants the average weight of all apples picked to be exactly 150 grams. \n\nHow many apples must he have picked on Day 1 to achieve his desired overall average?\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"hard\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"This question is tricky because it involves using the concept of averages in reverse and requires setting up an equation to find the missing quantity. Here's how to solve it:\\n\\n**1. Understand the Goal:** The farmer wants an overall average of 150 grams per apple. This means the total weight of all apples should be 150 grams/apple * Total number of apples.\\n\\n**2. Calculate Total Weight Needed:**  Since we need to find the number of apples on Day 1, let's represent it as 'x'. The total number of apples picked is (x + Day 2 apples + 200). To get an average of 150 grams, the equation for total weight is: \\n\\n150 * (x + Day 2 apples + 200) = Total weight\\n\\n**3. Express Day 2 Apples:** We don't know how many apples were picked on Day 2, but we can express it in terms of the total weight and average weight: \\n\\nDay 2 apples = (Total weight on Day 2) / 160 grams/apple\\n\\n**4.  Formulate the Equation:** Now we can substitute to get one equation: \\n\\n150 * (x + (Total weight on Day 2)/160 + 200) =  (150x) + (Total weight on Day 2) + (140 * 200) \\n\\n**5. Simplify and Solve for x:**  Notice that 'Total weight on Day 2' appears on both sides and cancels out. This leaves us with:\\n\\n150x + 30000 = 150x + 28000\\n\\nThis equation has no solution, meaning it's impossible for the farmer to achieve his desired overall average regardless of how many apples he picked on Day 1. The higher average on Day 2 makes it impossible to compensate even if he picked zero apples on Day 1.\"\n}\n``` \n",

The remaining batteries come from Factory C and have an average lifespan of 22 hours. \\n\\nA quality control inspector randomly selects a battery from the batch. If the chosen battery lasts less than 19 hours, what is the probability that it was manufactured by Factory B?\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"hard\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"This problem involves a combination of averages and conditional probability. Here's how to solve it step-by-step:\\n\\n**1. Calculate the weighted average battery lifespan:** \\n\\n   - Multiply each factory's percentage contribution by their average lifespan:\\n      - Factory A: 0.40 * 20 hours = 8 hours\\n      - Factory B: 0.35 * 18 hours = 6.3 hours\\n      - Factory C: 0.25 * 22 hours = 5.5 hours \\n   - Sum these values to find the weighted average lifespan: 8 + 6.3 + 5.5 = 19.8 hours\\n\\n**2.  Determine the probability of a battery lasting less than 19 hours from each factory:**\\n\\n   -  We don't have enough information to calculate this precisely.  We only know average lifespans, not the distribution of lifespans. This makes the problem tricky.  We'll have to make an assumption to proceed. \\n\\n   - **Assumption:**  Let's assume for simplicity that battery lifespans for each factory follow a uniform distribution.  This isn't realistic, but it allows us to proceed with a calculation. \\n\\n   - **Under the uniform distribution assumption:**\\n       -  Factory A:  Any lifespan between 0 and 40 hours is equally likely.  The probability of a lifespan less than 19 hours is approximately 19/40. \\n       -  Factory B: Probability of a lifespan less than 19 hours is approximately 19/36.\\n       -  Factory C: Probability of a lifespan less than 19 hours is approximately 19/44.\\n\\n**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem to calculate the conditional probability:**\\n\\n   - Bayes' Theorem tells us: P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / P(A)\\n\\n   - In our context:\\n       - P(B|A) = Probability the battery is from Factory B *given* it lasts less than 19 hours (what we want to find).\\n       - P(A|B) = Probability a battery lasts less than 19 hours *given* it's from Factory B (approximately 19/36 from our assumption).\\n       - P(B) = Probability a battery is from Factory B (0.35, given in the problem).\\n       - P(A) = Overall probability a battery lasts less than 19 hours (we need to calculate this). \\n\\n**4. Calculate P(A), the overall probability of a battery lasting less than 19 hours:** \\n\\n   -  P(A) = [P(A|Factory A) * P(Factory A)] + [P(A|Factory B) * P(Factory B)] + [P(A|Factory C) * P(Factory C)]\\n   -  P(A) \u2248 (19/40 * 0.40) + (19/36 * 0.35) + (19/44 * 0.25) \u2248 0.475 + 0.184 + 0.108 \u2248 0.767\\n\\n**5.  Finally, use Bayes' Theorem to get our answer:**\\n\\n   - P(Battery is from Factory B | Battery lasts less than 19 hours) \u2248 (19/36 * 0.35) / 0.767 \u2248 0.24 or 24%\\n\\n**Therefore, the probability that the battery was manufactured by Factory B given it lasted less than 19 hours is approximately 24%.**\\n\\n**Important Notes:**\\n* This solution relies on the assumption of a uniform distribution for battery lifespans, which might not be accurate in reality. A more realistic approach would require knowledge of the actual lifespan distribution for each factory.\n* This problem highlights the challenges of working with averages and probabilities, especially when dealing with limited information.\" \n},\n\"option and correct options\": {\n    \"A\": \"18%\",\n    \"B\": \"24%\",\n    \"C\": \"35%\", \n    \"D\": \"47%\"\n }\n}\n```",

Here's how we solve it:\\n\\n**Understanding the Problem:** \\nThe farmer records the difference from the running average, not the actual weight. This is crucial. For example, '+5 kg' on Day 1 means his harvest was 5 kg *more* than the average up to that day (which is just the weight of the Day 1 harvest itself). \\n\\n**Key Insight:**\\nThe sum of all deviations from the average always equals zero. This property is fundamental to understanding averages. Notice how the positive and negative deviations in the farmer's record hint at this. \\n\\n**Solution:**\\n\\n1. **Last Three Days:** We know the total weight of the last three days is 50 kg. Let 'x' be the average weight of apples harvested each day over the entire week. The sum of the deviations for the last three days should be zero when considering the overall average. So, (x + 4 - x) + (x - 3 - x) = 0. This simplifies to 1 = 0, which is not possible. This indicates the average calculated for the last three days is not the same as the average for the entire week. \n\n2. **Finding the overall average:** Let's denote the average weight of apples harvested each day over the first four days as 'y'. The total weight for the first four days is then '4y'.  The total weight for the week is '4y + 50'.  Therefore, the average weight 'x' for the entire week can be expressed as:  x = (4y + 50) / 7. \n\n3. **Using Deviations:** Now, let's utilize the deviations provided for the first four days.\n    * Day 1: y + 5 - x = 0  \n    * Day 2: y - 1 - x = 0\n    * Day 3: y + 3 - x = 0\n    * Day 4: y - 2 - x = 0\n\n    Substituting the value of 'x' from step 2 into any of these equations, for instance, the first equation, we get: y + 5 - (4y + 50) / 7 = 0.\n\n4. **Solving for y:** Simplifying the equation: 7y + 35 - 4y - 50 = 0. This gives us 3y = 15, and therefore, y = 5.\n\n5. **Calculating x:** Substituting 'y = 5' back into the equation for 'x': x = (4 * 5 + 50) / 7 = 70 / 7 = 10.\n\n**Therefore, the average weight of apples harvested each day over the entire week is 10 kg.**\"\n}\n``` \n",
