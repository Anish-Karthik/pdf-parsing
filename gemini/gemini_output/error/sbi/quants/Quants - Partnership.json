Calculate David's Share:**\n\n* David's 10% stake is deducted proportionally from Ben and Carl: \n    * Ben's adjusted investment: $100,000 - (0.10 * $100,000) = $90,000\n    * Carl's adjusted investment: $25,000 - (0.10 * $25,000) = $22,500\n\n**3. Calculate Total Investment:**\n\n* Total adjusted investment: $50,000 (Alex) + $90,000 (Ben) + $22,500 (Carl) = $162,500\n\n**4. Calculate Profit Shares:**\n\n* Profit after Alex's salary: $60,000 - $12,000 = $48,000\n* Alex's profit share (beyond salary): ($50,000 / $162,500) * $48,000 = $14,814.81\n* Ben's profit share: ($90,000 / $162,500) * $48,000 = $26,666.67\n* Carl's profit share: ($22,500 / $162,500) * $48,000 = $6,666.67\n* David's profit share: 0.10 * $60,000 = $6,000\n\n**5. Calculate Total Amounts Received:**\n\n* Alex: $12,000 (salary) + $14,814.81 (profit share) = $26,814.81\n* Ben: $26,666.67 \n* Carl: $6,666.67\n* David: $6,000\n\nTherefore, Alex receives $26,814.81, Ben receives $26,666.67, Carl receives $6,666.67, and David receives $6,000.\"\n}\n``` \n",

Here's how to break it down:\n\n**1. Calculate the interest periods:**\n\n* **Alex:** Withdraws at the beginning of each quarter, meaning his money is out for longer periods. We need to consider the interest for each quarter separately.\n* **Blake:** Withdraws monthly for the first 9 months.  We can either calculate interest for each month or find the average balance for those 9 months and apply interest for that period.\n\n**2. Calculate interest for Alex:**\n\n* **Quarter 1:** $1,500 for 12 months = $1,500 * 8/100 = $120\n* **Quarter 2:** $1,500 for 9 months = $1,500 * 8/100 * 9/12 = $90\n* **Quarter 3:** $1,500 for 6 months = $1,500 * 8/100 * 6/12 = $60\n* **Quarter 4:** $1,500 for 3 months = $1,500 * 8/100 * 3/12 = $30\n* **Total interest on Alex's drawings:** $120 + $90 + $60 + $30 = $300\n\n**3. Calculate interest for Blake:**\n\n* **Total withdrawal in 9 months:** $500/month * 9 months = $4,500\n* **Average monthly withdrawal:** $4,500 / 9 = $500\n* **Interest for 9 months:** $500 * 8/100 * 9/12 = $30 per month * 9 months = $270\n* **Total interest on Blake's drawings:** $270 \n\n**4. Find the difference:**\n\n* **Difference in interest:** $300 (Alex) - $270 (Blake) = $30\n\n**Therefore, the difference between the total interest charged on Alex's drawings and Blake's drawings at the end of the year is $30.**\"\n}\n```",
