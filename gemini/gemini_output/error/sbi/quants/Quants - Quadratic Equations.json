Then, it's vertically stretched by a factor of 4, followed by a horizontal shift 2 units to the left, and finally, a vertical translation 5 units downwards. Determine the domain and range of this transformed parabola, and express your answer in set notation.\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"medium\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"This question falls under the 'Quadratic Functions: Domain, Range, and Transformations' subtopic within 'Quants - Quadratic Equations'. Here's a step-by-step solution:\\n\\n1. **Reflection across the x-axis:** This transforms the equation to y = -x\u00b2. \\n2. **Vertical stretch by a factor of 4:** This changes the equation to y = -4x\u00b2.\\n3. **Horizontal shift 2 units to the left:**  The equation becomes y = -4(x + 2)\u00b2.\\n4. **Vertical translation 5 units downwards:** This gives us the final equation of the transformed parabola: y = -4(x + 2)\u00b2 - 5. \\n\\nNow, let's determine the domain and range:\\n\\n**Domain:**  Quadratic functions inherently have a domain of all real numbers since we can input any real value for 'x' and get a valid output. Therefore, the domain is  (-\u221e, \u221e).\\n\\n**Range:** Due to the reflection and the negative leading coefficient, the parabola opens downwards. Its vertex is at (-2, -5).  Therefore, the range, which represents all possible y-values, is  (-\u221e, -5].\\n\\n**Answer:**\\nDomain:  { x | x \u2208 R }  or (-\u221e, \u221e)\\nRange: { y | y \u2264 -5 } or  (-\u221e, -5]\"\n}\n``` \n",
            "option": "```json\n{\n  \"options\": [\n    \"{ x | x \u2208 R }\",\n    \"(-\u221e, -5]\",\n    \"(-\u221e, \u221e)\",\n    \"{ y | y \u2264 -5 }\"\n  ],\n  \"correct_option\": \"D\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe question asks for the domain and range of the transformed parabola.  The correct answer is the range:\n\n* **\"{ y | y \u2264 -5 }\"** represents the set of all y-values less than or equal to -5. This matches the range determined in the reasoning,  (-\u221e, -5].\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **\"{ x | x \u2208 R }\"**  represents the domain (all real numbers), not the range.\n* **\"(-\u221e, -5]\"** is the correct representation of the range in interval notation, but the question asks for set notation.\n* **\"(-\u221e, \u221e)\"** represents the domain, not the range. \n"
