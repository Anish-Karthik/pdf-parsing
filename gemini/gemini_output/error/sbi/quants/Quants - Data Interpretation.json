            "question": "I understand! You want a tool that can generate challenging data interpretation questions from caselets, specifically within the realm of \"Quants - Data Interpretation.\" You want the questions to be customizable by difficulty level and topic, and you want the tool to provide not just the answer, but a detailed, step-by-step solution and reasoning process. \n\nI can help you design this tool. Here's a breakdown of the components and how we can approach building them:\n\n**1. Caselet Generation Engine:**\n\n*   **Data Source:**\n    *   You'll need a database of caselets. You can start with a collection you create manually and expand it over time. \n    *   Consider using web scraping techniques to extract caselets from online resources (with proper permissions, of course).\n*   **Caselet Structure:**\n    *   Each caselet should be stored with a consistent format, including:\n        *   Title/Short Description\n        *   Data Table (if applicable)\n        *   Chart (if applicable)\n        *   Relevant Context/Background information\n*   **Topic Tagging:**\n    *   Tag each caselet with relevant topics (e.g., \"Revenue Growth,\" \"Customer Acquisition,\" \"Market Share,\" etc.) for easy searching and filtering.\n\n**2. Question Generation Engine:**\n\n*   **Question Templates:**\n    *   Create a library of question templates for each question type (Calculation, Comparison, Inference, Analysis). \n    *   Templates should be designed to pull data dynamically from the caselet.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   **Template:** \"What is the percentage increase in [Variable X] from [Time Period 1] to [Time Period 2]?\"\n        *   **Engine Fills In:**  \"[Variable X],\" \"[Time Period 1],\" and \"[Time Period 2]\" based on the caselet data.\n*   **Difficulty Control:**\n    *   **Easy:**  Straightforward calculations or comparisons using clearly presented data.\n    *   **Medium:** Introduce multi-step calculations, require analysis of trends, or involve finding relationships between different data points.\n    *   **Hard:**  Demand complex calculations, involve making predictions or inferences with limited data, or require understanding of underlying business concepts.\n*   **Verbosity Control:**\n    *   Adjust sentence complexity and length based on difficulty. \n    *   Harder questions might require more context or background information.\n\n**3. Reasoning and Solution Engine:**\n\n*   **Step-by-Step Solver:**\n    *   Develop an algorithm that can solve the generated questions step-by-step, mimicking human reasoning.\n    *   This will involve:\n        *   Identifying relevant data from the caselet.\n        *   Performing necessary calculations.\n        *   Drawing logical conclusions.\n*   **Explanation Generator:**\n    *   Translate each step of the solution into clear, concise explanations.\n    *   Use visuals (graphs, charts, etc.) to illustrate concepts where applicable.\n\n**4. Option Generation:**\n\n*   **Plausible Distractors:**\n    *   Create options that are close to the correct answer but based on common errors (e.g., misreading data, incorrect formulas, flawed logic).\n    *   The difficulty of the question should also influence the plausibility of the distractors.\n\n**5. Output Format (JSON):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"caselet\": {\n    \"title\": \"Caselet Title\",\n    \"data_table\": [ /* Data in JSON format */ ],\n    \"chart\": \"URL to chart image\",\n    \"context\": \"Background information for the caselet\"\n  },\n  \"question\": \"Question Statement\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"easy\" or \"medium\" or \"hard\",\n  \"reasoning\": [\n    { \"step\": \"Explanation of step 1\" },\n    { \"step\": \"Explanation of step 2\" },\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"options\": [\n    \"Option A\",\n    \"Option B\",\n    \"Option C\",\n    \"Option D\"\n  ],\n  \"correct_option\": \"Correct Option (e.g., 'B')\" \n}\n```\n\n**Technology Stack:**\n\n*   **Programming Language:** Python is well-suited for this due to its extensive libraries for data manipulation (pandas), web scraping (Beautiful Soup), and scientific computing (NumPy).\n*   **Database:** Consider using a NoSQL database like MongoDB to store the caselets flexibly.\n*   **Web Framework (Optional):** If you want a user interface, frameworks like Flask or Django can be used. \n\n**Building this tool will be a significant undertaking, but the result will be a powerful resource for students preparing for quantitative and data interpretation exams.**\n\nLet me know if you want to delve into a specific aspect of this tool. I'm happy to help you brainstorm further! \n",
