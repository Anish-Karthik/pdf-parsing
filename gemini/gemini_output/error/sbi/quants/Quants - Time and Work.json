Their combined work rate is 1/12 of the project per day.\\n* The backend team's work rate is 1/18 of the project per day.\\n\\n**2. Work completed in the first 3 days:**\\n\\n* Frontend: (1/12 project/day) * 3 days = 1/4 of the project\\n* Backend: (1/18 project/day) * 3 days = 1/6 of the project \\n\\n**3.

Calculate the number of days Team Alpha and Team Gamma take to complete the remaining work:**\n\n* **Days to complete remaining work:** (31/60) / (3/20) = 31/9 days\n\n**Therefore, it will take an additional 31/9 days (approximately 3.44 days) for Team Alpha and Team Gamma to finish the bridge design.**\"\n},\n\"options\": [\n    \"3 days\", \n    \"3 1/3 days\", \n    \"3 1/2 days\",\n    \"3 4/9 days\",\n    \"3 5/9 days\"\n],\n\"correct_option\": \"3 4/9 days\"\n``` \n",

            "question": "```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"Anya and Boris are tasked with sorting a mountain of paperwork. Anya, a whiz with organization, can sort the entire pile alone in 10 hours. Boris, a bit slower but still dedicated, would take 15 hours to complete the task on his own. They decide to tackle the paperwork by working in alternating hours, with Anya taking on the first hour.  \n\n  However, there's a catch! Every time Boris works, his previous hour of rest makes him extra efficient, increasing his work rate by 20% compared to the previous time he worked.  This boost is cumulative for each hour Boris rests.  \n\n  How long will it take Anya and Boris to sort the entire pile of paperwork with this system?\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"hard\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:\\n\\n**1. Calculate individual work rates:**\\n   * Anya's rate: 1/10 (She completes 1/10th of the work per hour)\\n   * Boris's initial rate: 1/15 (He completes 1/15th of the work per hour)\\n\\n**2. Analyze the alternating work pattern:**\\n   * Hour 1: Anya works at her standard rate.\\n   * Hour 2: Boris works with a 20% increased rate.\\n   * Hour 3: Anya works at her standard rate.\\n   * Hour 4: Boris works with a further 20% increased rate (44% total increase from his initial rate), and so on.\\n\\n**3. Calculate Boris's work done in each of his working hours:**\\n   * Hour 2: (1/15) * 1.2 = 1/12.5 (He completes 1/12.5th of the work)\\n   * Hour 4: (1/12.5) * 1.2 = 27/312.5  \\n   * Hour 6: (27/312.5) * 1.2 = 324/3906.25, and so on\\n\\n**4. Determine the work done in a two-hour cycle (Anya then Boris):**\\n   *  We need to find a pattern in the combined work done every two hours. Notice that the work done in every two hours keeps increasing due to Boris's increasing efficiency.\\n\\n**5.  Calculate the time taken to complete the task:**\\n   * Since there's no easily discernible pattern, we'll have to calculate the work done in each 2-hour cycle and add it up until we reach 1 (representing the whole task).\\n   * Keep track of the cumulative work done after each 2-hour cycle.\\n   * Stop when the cumulative work equals or exceeds 1.\\n\\n**Calculations:**\\n\\n* Hour 1-2:  (1/10) + (1/12.5) = 9/50  \n* Hour 3-4:  (9/50) + (1/10) + (27/312.5) =  423/1250 \n* Hour 5-6: (423/1250) + (1/10) + (324/3906.25) =  25659/78125 \n* Hour 7-8: (25659/78125) + (1/10) + ((324/3906.25)*1.2) = 314436/976562.5 \n* Hour 9-10: (314436/976562.5) + (1/10) + (((324/3906.25)*1.2)*1.2) =  >1  (We've exceeded the whole task)\\n\\nTherefore, it takes Anya and Boris a total of **10 hours** to sort the paperwork.\\n\"\n}\n```",
