He has two shades of green available: a lighter shade that costs $12 per liter and contains 30% green pigment, and a darker shade that costs $18 per liter and contains 60% green pigment. He needs 10 liters of the specific shade, which should cost $15 per liter and contain 45% green pigment. However, due to limited stock, he can only use a maximum of 4 liters of the darker shade. Can he create the desired shade of green with these constraints? If yes, how many liters of each shade should he mix?\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"easy\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"**1. Analyzing the Constraints:**\n\n   * **Target Cost:** The painter wants a 10-liter mixture costing $15/liter, meaning the total cost should be 10 * $15 = $150.\n   * **Target Pigment:** He needs 45% green pigment in the final mixture.\n   * **Limited Dark Shade:**  He can use a maximum of 4 liters of the darker shade. \n\n   **2. Setting up the Equations:**\n\n   Let... \n    *  'x' be the amount (in liters) of the lighter shade (30% pigment).\n    *  'y' be the amount (in liters) of the darker shade (60% pigment).\n\n   We have two main equations based on the given information:\n\n   * **Equation 1 (Total Volume):** x + y = 10 \n   * **Equation 2 (Pigment Concentration):** 0.30x + 0.60y = 0.45 * 10 \n\n   **3. Solving for 'x' and 'y' :**\n\n   * From Equation 1, we get: x = 10 - y\n   * Substituting this value of 'x' in Equation 2: 0.30(10 - y) + 0.60y = 4.5\n   * Simplifying: 3 - 0.3y + 0.6y = 4.5\n   * Further simplification: 0.3y = 1.5\n   * Therefore: y = 5 liters \n\n   * Substituting 'y = 5' back into Equation 1: x + 5 = 10\n   * Hence: x = 5 liters\n\n   **4. Checking the Constraint:**\n\n   * The calculation suggests he needs 5 liters of the darker shade, but the constraint limits it to 4 liters. \n\n   **Final Answer:** No, the painter cannot create the desired shade of green with the given constraints.\"\n}\n``` \n",

He has two types of gold alloys available: one with 60% gold and another with 80% gold.  However, he only has 70 grams of the 60% gold alloy.  How much of each alloy should he use to create the desired 200 gram mixture?\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"easy\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"This question falls under the 'Advanced Problems: Mixtures with Constraints' subtopic because it involves finding the right quantities of two mixtures to achieve a target concentration while working within a specific constraint (limited quantity of one alloy).\\n\\nHere's how to solve it:\\n\\n**1. Define Variables:**\\n    *  Let 'x' be the amount (in grams) of the 60% gold alloy.\\n    *  Let 'y' be the amount (in grams) of the 80% gold alloy.\\n\\n**2. Set up the Equations:**\\n    *  We know the total weight is 200 grams: x + y = 200\\n    *  We know the desired gold concentration is 70%: 0.6x + 0.8y = 0.7 * 200\\n    *  We have a constraint on the 60% alloy: x <= 70 \\n\\n**3. Solve the Equations:**\\n    * From the constraint, we know we can use a maximum of 70 grams of the 60% alloy. Let's assume we use all 70 grams.\\n    * Substituting x = 70 into the first equation: 70 + y = 200.  Solving for y, we get y = 130 grams.\\n\\n**4. Check for Validity:**\\n    *  Let's check if using 70 grams of the 60% alloy and 130 grams of the 80% alloy gives us a 70% concentration:\\n        (0.6 * 70) + (0.8 * 130) = 42 + 104 = 146 grams of pure gold.\\n        The final concentration is (146 / 200) * 100% = 73%\\n\\n**5. Adjust if Necessary:**\\n   *  The concentration is slightly higher than 70%.  Since the 80% alloy is contributing to a higher concentration, we need to use slightly less of it.  However, since the question asks for the amounts to be determined to create the desired mixture *exactly*, and we only have a constraint on one of the alloys, we can conclude that it is not possible to create the *exact* desired concentration with the given constraints. \n\n**Therefore, the jeweler cannot create the desired 200 gram alloy with a 70% gold concentration given the available materials.** \n}\n``` \n",

He wishes to create a 20 kg blend that he can sell for Rs. 500 per kg.  What ratio, by weight, should he use of the Darjeeling and Assam teas if he wants to minimize the amount of local tea in the blend?\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"medium\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Here's how to solve this problem using the Alligation Rule:\\n\\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\\n\\nThe merchant wants to make a 20 kg tea blend worth Rs. 500/kg. This means the total value of the blend should be 20 kg * Rs. 500/kg = Rs. 10,000.\\n\\n**2. Minimize Local Tea:**\\n\\nTo minimize the local tea, we should maximize the use of the two more expensive teas \u2013 Darjeeling and Assam.  \\n\\n**3. Apply Alligation for Darjeeling and Assam:**\\n\\n* **Step a:** Imagine mixing just Darjeeling and Assam to achieve the desired Rs. 500/kg price.  \\n* **Step b:**  Set up the Alligation diagram:\\n\\n   ```\\n        800 (Darjeeling)         | \\n                                   >  500 (Desired Price)\\n        550 (Assam)            | /\\n   ```\\n\\n* **Step c:** Calculate the differences: \\n    * 800 - 500 = 300\\n    * 500 - 550 = -50 (Note: Use the absolute value, 50)\\n\\n* **Step d:** The ratio of Darjeeling to Assam is 50:300, which simplifies to 1:6. \\n\\n**4. Determine Quantities:**\\n\\n* For every 7 kg of this Darjeeling-Assam blend (1 kg Darjeeling + 6 kg Assam), 1 kg is Darjeeling, and 6 kg is Assam. \\n* To figure out how much of this blend to use in the 20 kg mix, we'll need to calculate later.\\n\\n**5.  Incorporate the Local Tea:**\\n\\n* Let 'x' represent the weight of the Darjeeling-Assam blend used.\\n* The weight of the local tea will be (20 - x) kg.\\n\\n**6. Set up the Equation:**\\n\\nThe total value of each tea type in the blend should equal the total value of the desired blend (Rs. 10,000):\\n\\n (x kg * Rs. 500/kg) + ((20 - x) kg * Rs. 300/kg) = Rs. 10,000\\n\\n**7. Solve for x:**\\n\\n* 500x + 6000 - 300x = 10000\\n* 200x = 4000\\n* x = 20 kg\\n\\n**8. Analyze the Result:**\\n\\nThe result, x = 20 kg, means that to minimize the local tea, we would use 20 kg of the Darjeeling-Assam blend. However, this contradicts our goal of making a 20 kg blend in total.  This indicates that to achieve the target price of Rs. 500/kg, *some* local tea is necessary.\\n\\n**9. Adjust and Recalculate:**\\n\\nSince we need to include some local tea, let's reduce the amount of the Darjeeling-Assam blend. Let's try using 14 kg of the blend (a multiple of 7, maintaining the 1:6 ratio):\\n\\n* Darjeeling: (1/7) * 14 kg = 2 kg\\n* Assam: (6/7) * 14 kg = 12 kg\\n* Local tea: 20 kg - 14 kg = 6 kg\\n\\n**10. Verify the Blend Value:**\\n\\n* Darjeeling: 2 kg * Rs. 800/kg = Rs. 1600\\n* Assam: 12 kg * Rs. 550/kg = Rs. 6600\\n* Local Tea: 6 kg * Rs. 300/kg = Rs. 1800\\n\\n* Total value: Rs. 1600 + Rs. 6600 + Rs. 1800 = Rs. 10,000 \\n\\nThis combination achieves the target blend value.\\n\\n**Answer:**\\n\\nThe merchant should use Darjeeling and Assam teas in the ratio of 1:6 by weight to minimize the amount of local tea in the blend. This translates to 2 kg of Darjeeling tea and 12 kg of Assam tea. \n\"\n}\n```",

Mark the purities of the three original alloys (20%, 30%, 50%) and the target purity (32%).\n\n  2. **Apply Alligation:**  \n      *  The difference between the target purity (32%) and a lower purity alloy represents the ratio in which the higher purity alloy should be mixed.\n      * For example, (32% - 20%) = 12 parts of the 50% alloy should be mixed with (50% - 32%) = 18 parts of the 20% alloy.\n      * Similarly, (32% - 20%) = 12 parts of the 50% alloy should be mixed with (50% - 30%) = 20 parts of the 30% alloy. \n\n  3. **Determine Ratios:** This means the alloys need to be mixed in the following ratios to achieve 32% purity:\n      * 20% alloy : 50% alloy = 18:12 = 3:2\n      * 30% alloy : 50% alloy = 20:12 = 5:3\n\n  4. **Find Individual Weights:**  \n      * Since we need a total of 100 grams of the 32% alloy, let's assume the jeweler uses 'x' grams of the 50% alloy. \n      * Based on the ratios from step 3, he would need (3/2)x grams of the 20% alloy and (5/3)x grams of the 30% alloy.\n      * The total weight equation becomes: x + (3/2)x + (5/3)x = 100\n\n  5. **Solve for x:** \n      * Simplifying the equation: (31/6)x = 100\n      * Solving for x: x \u2248 19.35 grams (approximately)\n\n  6. **Calculate Weights for Each Alloy:**\n      * 50% alloy: x \u2248 19.35 grams\n      * 20% alloy: (3/2)x \u2248 29.03 grams \n      * 30% alloy: (5/3)x \u2248 32.26 grams\n\n  **Therefore, the jeweler should use approximately 29.03 grams of the 20% alloy, 32.26 grams of the 30% alloy, and 19.35 grams of the 50% alloy to create 100 grams of a 32% gold alloy bracelet.**\"\n}\n```",

To minimize the cost, he wants to use the least amount of the 24-karat alloy. What ratio of 14-karat to 24-karat alloy should he use to achieve the desired 18-karat purity while utilizing all of the 10-karat alloy?\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"tricky 8/10\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"This question falls under the 'Allegation Cross Method for Quick Ratio Calculation' subtopic within 'Quants - Mixtures and Alligations'.  It's tricky because it combines multiple factors:\\n\\n1. **Three Alloys:** Instead of the typical two, we're dealing with mixing three different gold alloys.\\n2. **Fixed Quantity:** The 20 grams of 10-karat alloy must be used entirely, adding a constraint.\\n3. **Minimizing Cost:** This implies finding the smallest possible proportion of the 24-karat alloy, adding a layer of optimization to the ratio calculation.\\n\\n**Solution:**\\n\\n1. **Convert Karats to Percentages:**  Treat karats as a percentage of pure gold. So, 10-karat is 10/24 (approximately 41.67%), 14-karat is 14/24 (approximately 58.33%), 18-karat is 18/24 (75%), and 24-karat is 100% pure gold. \\n\\n2. **Visualize with the Allegation Cross:**\\n\\n   * Place the desired purity (18 karats or 75%) in the center.\\n   * Arrange the alloy purities (41.67%, 58.33%, 100%) on the left side.\\n   * Calculate the differences diagonally and place them on the opposite side.\\n\\n ```\\n        41.67% (10K) -------------- 25    (75% - 58.33%)\\n                     \\\\      / \\n                      75% (18K)\\n                     /      \\\\   \\n        58.33% (14K) -------------- 33.33 (100% - 75%)\\n                                         |\\n        100%  (24K) -------------- 16.67 (75% - 41.67%)\\n ```\\n\\n3. **Initial Ratio (Without Constraint):**  The allegation cross suggests a ratio of 25:33.33:16.67 for the 10K, 14K, and 24K alloys, respectively.\\n\\n4. **Adjust for Fixed 10K:** Since we have a fixed 20 grams of 10K, and the ratio is 25 parts, each part represents 20 grams / 25 parts = 0.8 grams. \\n\\n5. **Calculate 14K and 24K Amounts:**\\n   * 14K: 33.33 parts * 0.8 grams/part = 26.66 grams\\n   * 24K: 16.67 parts * 0.8 grams/part = 13.34 grams\\n\\n6. **Final Ratio (14K:24K):**  The jeweler should mix approximately 26.66 grams of 14-karat gold with approximately 13.34 grams of 24-karat gold to achieve the desired 18-karat purity while using all 20 grams of the 10-karat alloy.\\n\\n**Therefore, the ratio of 14-karat to 24-karat alloy is approximately 2:1.**\" \n}\n```\n\n**Option and Correct Options:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"options\": [\n    \"1:1\",\n    \"2:1\",\n    \"3:2\",\n    \"4:3\"\n  ],\n  \"correct_option\": \"2:1\"\n}\n``` \n",
