Calculating the Number of Pigeonholes:**\\n\\n* We need to find how many ways we can choose 3 courts out of 5. This is a combination problem, denoted as '5 choose 3' or \u2075C\u2083, calculated as:\\n   \u2075C\u2083 = 5! / (3! * 2!) = 10\\n* There are 10 possible combinations of courts a team can practice on.\\n\\n**3. Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:** \\n\\n* We have 11 teams (pigeons) and 10 court combinations (pigeonholes).\\n* The Pigeonhole Principle states that if we have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.\\n* Therefore, at least **2 teams** are guaranteed to have at least one common practice court in their available slots. \n\n**4.  Options:**\n\n* a) 1 \n* b) 2\n* c) 3\n* d) 4\n\n**Correct Option:** b) 2\" \n}\n``` \n",

            "question": "```json\n{\n  \"question\": {\n    \"Context\": \"A renowned chef is crafting a unique tasting menu for a prestigious culinary event.  The menu will feature 7 courses, and to elevate the dining experience, each course can be paired with one of 4 distinctive aromatic infusions: Citrus Burst, Smoky Spice, Herbal Harmony, or Floral Essence.\",\n    \"Question\": \"How many different ways can the chef arrange the aromatic infusions across the 7-course tasting menu if some courses might feature the same infusion, and the chef wants to ensure that each possible arrangement includes at least one course with each of the 4 unique infusions?\",\n    \"Constraints/Conditions\": \"Each of the 4 infusions must be used at least once across the 7 courses.\",\n    \"Difficulty Level\": \"tricky 8/10\"\n  },\n  \"difficulty\": \"hard\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"This problem is categorized as 'hard' due to the combination of permutations with repetition and the added constraint of mandatory inclusion.  Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n**1. Addressing the Constraint:**\n\n* Since each of the 4 infusions must be used at least once, let's pre-assign them to 4 of the 7 courses. This leaves us with 3 courses where we have the flexibility to use any of the 4 infusions.\n\n**2. Permutations with Repetition (Initial Calculation):**\n\n* Without the constraint, we'd have 4 choices of infusion for each of the 7 courses, leading to 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 4^7 = 16,384 possible arrangements.\n\n**3. Adjusting for Overcounting:**\n\n* The initial calculation (4^7) includes arrangements where we might not have all 4 infusions present. To correct for this, we'll use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\n**4. Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:**\n\n   * **Subtract arrangements with at least one infusion missing:** There are 4 ways to choose which infusion is missing, and then 3^7 ways to fill the 7 courses with the remaining 3 infusions. So, we subtract 4 * 3^7.\n   * **Add back arrangements with at least two infusions missing:** There are 6 ways to choose which two infusions are missing (4C2), and 2^7 ways to fill the courses with the remaining 2 infusions. We add back 6 * 2^7.\n   * **Subtract arrangements with at least three infusions missing:** There are 4 ways to choose which three are missing, and only 1^7 ways to fill the courses with the remaining one. We subtract 4 * 1^7.\n\n**5. Final Calculation:**\n\n* Total arrangements = (Total arrangements without constraint) - (Arrangements with at least one missing) + (Arrangements with at least two missing) - (Arrangements with at least three missing)\n* Total arrangements = 4^7 - (4 * 3^7) + (6 * 2^7) - (4 * 1^7) \n* Total arrangements = 16,384 - 8,748 + 768 - 4\n* Total arrangements = 8,400\n\n**Therefore, there are 8,400 different ways the chef can arrange the aromatic infusions across the tasting menu, ensuring each infusion is featured at least once.**\"\n}\n``` \n",
