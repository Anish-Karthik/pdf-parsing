Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to apply the Euler-Lagrange equation to this scenario: \\n\\n**1. Setting Up the Problem**\\n\\n* **Potential Energy:** The potential energy (PE) of a small segment of the cable is given by *dPE = (dm)gh*, where *dm* is the mass of the segment, *g* is the acceleration due to gravity, and *h* is the height of the segment above a reference level. Since the cable has uniform linear density (mass per unit length) *\u03c1*, we have *dm = \u03c1 ds*, where *ds* is the length of the segment. Using the Pythagorean theorem, *ds = sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx*. Assuming the reference level for potential energy is at y=0, we have *h=y*.  Therefore, the potential energy of the entire cable is: \\n\\n   *PE = \u222b dPE = \u222b \u03c1g y sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx*  (integrated from x=0 to x=L)\\n\\n* **Lagrangian:** To apply the Euler-Lagrange equation, we need to express the problem in terms of a Lagrangian, which is a function of x, y(x), and y'(x) = dy/dx.  In this case, the Lagrangian is simply the integrand of the potential energy expression (since we're minimizing potential energy):\\n\\n   *L(x, y, y') = \u03c1g y sqrt(1 + (y')^2)* \\n\\n**2.

Determining the Minimum Number of Terms:**\\n\\n* **Alternating Series Estimation Theorem:** We can leverage the fact that the Taylor series for tanh(x) is an alternating series. This theorem states that the error in approximating an alternating series with the sum of its first 'n' terms is less than the absolute value of the (n+1)th term.\\n* **Finding the Right Term:** We need to find the smallest 'n' for which the (n+1)th term of the series is less than 0.001 when x = 0.8. This involves testing different values of 'n' in the general term formula.\\n* **General Term:**  The general term of the tanh(x) Taylor series is not straightforward to express, but we can observe a pattern and use it to find terms.  \\n\\n**2. Calculating the Approximation:**\\n\\n* **Using the Determined 'n':** Once we know the minimum number of terms ('n') required, we plug in x = 0.8 into the Taylor polynomial with those terms and calculate the sum. \\n\\n**3. Justifying the Error Bound (without calculator):**\\n\\n* **Reasoning about the Series:** Here, we need to argue that the remaining terms in the series (after the 'n' terms used) would sum to a value smaller than 0.001.

It goes beyond simply applying the Black-Scholes formula and requires a deeper understanding of Ito's Lemma and the risk-neutral valuation framework. Here's a step-by-step solution:\\n\\n**1. Ito's Lemma:**\\n\\n* We start by applying Ito's Lemma to the derivative price, V(S, t), which is a function of the stochastic process S(t) and time t. Ito's Lemma for a function  f(S, t) of a stochastic process driven by Brownian motion is:\\n\\n   ```\\ndf(S, t) = (\u2202f/\u2202t)dt + (\u2202f/\u2202S)dS + (1/2)(\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202S\u00b2)(dS)\u00b2 \\n```\\n\\n* In our case, f(S, t) = V(S, t), and S(t) follows the GBM: dS = \u03bcSdt + \u03c3SdW, where W is a Wiener process.\\n\\n* Substituting the GBM for dS and using (dW)\u00b2 = dt, we get:\\n\\n   ```\\ndV = (\u2202V/\u2202t)dt + (\u2202V/\u2202S)(\u03bcSdt + \u03c3SdW) + (1/2)(\u2202\u00b2V/\u2202S\u00b2)(\u03c3\u00b2S\u00b2dt)\\n     = [(\u2202V/\u2202t) + \u03bcS(\u2202V/\u2202S) + (1/2)\u03c3\u00b2S\u00b2(\u2202\u00b2V/\u2202S\u00b2)]dt + \u03c3S(\u2202V/\u2202S)dW \\n```\\n\\n**2. Replicating Portfolio:**\\n\\n* Now, we construct a portfolio \u03a0 consisting of the stock and the risk-free bond to replicate the derivative's payoff:\\n\\n   ```\\n\u03a0 = V - \u0394S\\n```\\n\\n* Here, \u0394 represents the number of stocks held.\\n* The change in the portfolio value over a small time interval dt is:\\n\\n   ```\\nd\u03a0 = dV - \u0394dS \\n```\\n\\n* Substitute the expressions for dV and dS from the previous steps. \\n\\n**3. Risk-Neutral Valuation and PDE:**\\n\\n* To eliminate the randomness (dW term), we choose \u0394 such that the coefficient of dW in the d\u03a0 expression becomes zero. This gives us:\\n\\n    ```\\n\u0394 = \u2202V/\u2202S \\n```\\n   * This choice of \u0394 makes the portfolio instantaneously risk-free.\\n\\n* Since the portfolio is now risk-free, its return should equal the risk-free rate for no-arbitrage conditions to hold:\\n\\n   ```\\nd\u03a0 = r\u03a0dt\\n```\\n\\n* Substitute the expressions for d\u03a0 and \u03a0, and cancel out the dt terms. This will result in the following PDE:\\n\\n   ```\\n(\u2202V/\u2202t) + rS(\u2202V/\u2202S) + (1/2)\u03c3\u00b2S\u00b2(\u2202\u00b2V/\u2202S\u00b2) - rV = 0 \\n```\\n\\n**This is the desired PDE that the price of the derivative contract must satisfy.**\\n\\n**Tricky aspects:**\\n\\n* This question requires a good grasp of both Ito's Lemma and the concept of a replicating portfolio. \n* The derivation involves several steps and careful manipulation of stochastic terms.\\n* Understanding why we set the coefficient of dW to zero and then equating the portfolio's return to the risk-free rate are crucial for the risk-neutral valuation principle.\n\n\"\n}\n```",

Choosing the Method:**\n\n  To find the surface area, we'll use the method of revolving a curve around an axis.

Change of Variables:** \\nTo apply Ito's Lemma, we need a function of $S_t$. Given we want  $\\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\ln S_T | S_0]$, let's define: \\n\\n$$ Y_t = \\\\ln S_t$$\\n\\n**2. Applying Ito's Lemma:**\\nIto's Lemma for a function $f(t,X_t)$ where $dX_t = a(t,X_t)dt + b(t,X_t)dW_t$  is:\\n\\n $$df(t,X_t) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial t} + a(t,X_t) \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{1}{2} b^2(t,X_t) \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\right)dt + b(t,X_t) \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x}dW_t$$\\n\\nApplying this to our problem, we have: $f(t, S_t) = \\\\ln S_t$, $a(t,S_t) = \\\\alpha (\\\\mu -  \\\\ln S_t)S_t$, and  $b(t,S_t) = \\\\sigma S_t$.  Computing the partial derivatives:\\n\\n* $\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial t} = 0$ \\n* $\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial S_t} = \\\\frac{1}{S_t}$ \\n* $\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial S_t^2} = -\\\\frac{1}{S_t^2}$ \\n\\nSubstituting these into Ito's Lemma:\\n\\n$$ dY_t = \\\\left(0 + \\\\alpha(\\\\mu - \\\\ln S_t)S_t \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{S_t} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sigma^2 S_t^2 \\\\cdot -\\\\frac{1}{S_t^2} \\\\right) dt + \\\\sigma S_t \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{S_t} dW_t$$\\n\\nSimplifying:\\n\\n $$dY_t = \\\\left(\\\\alpha (\\\\mu - Y_t) - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sigma^2 \\\\right)dt + \\\\sigma dW_t $$\n\n**3.  Recognizing the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Form:**\\nThe SDE for $dY_t$ is now in the standard Ornstein-Uhlenbeck form:\\n\\n $$ dY_t = \\\\theta (\\\\nu - Y_t) dt + \\\\sigma dW_t$$ \\n\\nWhere $\\\\theta = \\\\alpha$, $\\\\nu = \\\\mu - \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2\\\\alpha}$ \\n\\n**4. Solution of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck SDE:**\\nThe solution to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck SDE is known to be:\\n\\n$$Y_t = Y_0 e^{-\\\\theta t} + \\\\nu(1 - e^{-\\\\theta t}) + \\\\sigma \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\theta(t-s)}dW_s$$\\n\\n**5. Expected Value:** \\nTaking the expectation of both sides and using the fact that the expectation of an Ito integral is zero, we get:\\n\\n$$\\\\mathbb{E}[Y_T | Y_0] = Y_0 e^{-\\\\theta T} + \\\\nu (1 - e^{-\\\\theta T}) $$\\n\\n**6. Substituting Back:** \\nFinally, substitute back $Y_t = \\\\ln S_t$,  $\\\\theta = \\\\alpha$, and $\\\\nu = \\\\mu - \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2\\\\alpha}$:\\n\\n$$\\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\ln S_T | S_0] = \\\\ln S_0 e^{-\\\\alpha T} + \\\\left( \\\\mu - \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2\\\\alpha} \\\\right)(1 - e^{-\\\\alpha T}) $$\n\n**Therefore, the expression for the expected value of the logarithm of the commodity price at a future time T is:** \n\n$$\\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\ln S_T | S_0] = \\\\ln S_0 e^{-\\\\alpha T} + \\\\left( \\\\mu - \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2\\\\alpha} \\\\right)(1 - e^{-\\\\alpha T}) $$\n\"\n}\n```",

By averaging the slopes at the beginning and (predicted) end of the interval, it accounts for the curvature of the solution, reducing error accumulation.\n\n* **Step Size and Accuracy:**  Reducing the step size generally increases the accuracy of numerical methods for solving differential equations (up to a point, as very small steps can lead to increased round-off error). Smaller steps mean the approximation follows the actual solution curve more closely.\n\nIn this problem, reducing the step size further would likely lead to a more accurate approximation, but the computational cost would also increase. The analyst needs to strike a balance between desired accuracy and computational efficiency. \n\"\n}\n```",
