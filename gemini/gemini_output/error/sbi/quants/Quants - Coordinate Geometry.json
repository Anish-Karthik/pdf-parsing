What is the coordinate of one focal point of this elliptical pool?\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"medium\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"**1. Understand the Problem:**\\n\\nWe're given information about an elliptical pool and need to find the coordinates of one of its foci. \\n\\n**2. Key Concepts:**\\n\\n* **Ellipse Properties:** An ellipse has two foci. The sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant.  The major axis is the longest diameter of the ellipse, and the minor axis is the shortest diameter. \\n* **Standard Equation (Horizontal Ellipse):** The standard equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a horizontal major axis is (x^2/a^2) + (y^2/b^2) = 1, where 'a' is the distance from the center to a vertex (half the major axis length) and 'b' is the distance from the center to a co-vertex (half the minor axis length).\\n* **Relationship between a, b, and c:**  In an ellipse, a^2 = b^2 + c^2, where 'c' is the distance from the center of the ellipse to each focus.\\n\\n**3.  Extract Given Information:**\\n\\n* **Center:** The center of the ellipse is at (0, 0) since the widest points are equidistant from the origin.\\n* **Vertices:** The vertices are at (10, 0) and (-10, 0), meaning the major axis length (2a) is 20, so a = 10.\\n* **Minor Axis Length:** The distance across the pool through the widest points is the major axis length, which is given as 26 meters. \\n\\n**4. Calculate b:**\\n\\nSince the major axis length is 26 and a = 10, we can find b (half the minor axis length): b = 26 / 2 = 13.\\n\\n**5. Calculate c:**\\n\\nUsing the relationship a^2 = b^2 + c^2:\\n\\n* 10^2 = 13^2 + c^2\\n* 100 = 169 + c^2\\n* c^2 = -69\\n\\nSince c^2 cannot be negative, we realize we made an error in step 4. The major axis length should be the distance between the two vertices, which is 20, not 26. Let's correct that. \\n\\n**Corrected Step 4. Calculate b:**\\n\\nSince the major axis length is 20 and a = 10, we can find b: \\n*  b^2 =  a^2 - c^2 = 100 - c^2.  We still need to find c.\\n\\n**Corrected Step 5. Calculate c:**\\n\\nWe know the distance between the two foci is 2c and the major axis length is 2a = 20. Since the foci lie on the major axis, the sum of the distances from one vertex to each focus must equal the major axis length: \\n*  c + c + distance between foci = 20\\n* 2c + distance between foci = 20\\n\\nWe know the vertices are at (+/-10, 0) and the distance between them is 20, which is equal to the major axis length.  Therefore, the distance between the foci must be less than 20. The only way this is possible is if the foci lie on the major axis between the center and the vertices.  Therefore, the distance between the foci is 20 - 2c. \\n\\nSubstituting this back into our equation: \\n* 2c + (20 - 2c) = 20\\n*  This equation is always true, meaning the foci must lie on the major axis somewhere between the center and the vertices. \\n\\nWe can now use the fact that the sum of the distances from one vertex to each focus equals the major axis length. Let's pick the vertex (10, 0):\\n* Distance from (10, 0) to (c, 0) + Distance from (10, 0) to (-c, 0) = 20\\n* (10 - c) + (10 + c) = 20 \\n* 20 = 20\\n\\nThis tells us that our reasoning is correct, but we still need to find the actual value of c. Let's use the relationship  a^2 = b^2 + c^2 and the fact that we know a = 10 and the distance across the pool through the center (which is the minor axis) is 26 (so b = 13):\\n* 10^2 = 13^2 + c^2\\n* 100 = 169 + c^2\\n* c^2 = -69\\n\\nWe run into the same issue again! This tells us there's an error in our understanding of the problem.  The distance across the pool through the widest points MUST be the major axis, not the minor axis. Let's go back and correct our assumptions. \\n\\n**Corrected Understanding**\\n\\n* The widest points of the pool (10, 0) and (-10, 0) give us the vertices and thus define the major axis, not the minor axis. \\n* The distance across the pool through the widest points, 26 meters, is actually the major axis length. \\n\\n**Corrected Calculations**\\n\\n* **a:** a = 26 / 2 = 13\\n* **b:** We need to find b. We know the distance from the center to a vertex is 13 (a) and the distance from the center to the endpoint of the minor axis is 10.  This forms a right triangle where the hypotenuse is 13, one leg is 10, and the other leg is b. Using the Pythagorean theorem (or recognizing this is a 5-12-13 Pythagorean triple), we find b = 12. \\n* **c:**  a^2 = b^2 + c^2 --> 13^2 = 12^2 + c^2 --> c = 5\\n\\n**6. Find the Coordinates of a Focus:**\\n\\nSince the foci lie on the major axis, which is horizontal in this case, and the center is at (0, 0), one focus will be at (5, 0). \\n\\n**Therefore, the coordinate of one focal point of the elliptical pool is (5, 0).** \n},\n  \"options\": [\n    \"(5, 0)\",\n    \"(10, 0)\",\n    \"(0, 5)\",\n    \"(13, 0)\"\n  ],\n  \"correct_option\": \"(5, 0)\"\n}\n``` \n",
