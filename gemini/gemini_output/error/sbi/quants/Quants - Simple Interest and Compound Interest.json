            "question": "```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"A young entrepreneur is offered two investment options for their startup's profits: \\n\\n**Option A:** A high-growth fund guarantees a 10% annual interest rate compounded semi-annually, but the investment is locked in for 3 years.  \\n\\n**Option B:** A flexible investment account offers a 9.5% annual interest rate compounded monthly, with the ability to withdraw funds at any time.  \\n\\nIf the entrepreneur projects a profit of $50,000 after two years, which investment option would yield a higher return if they need to withdraw funds at that time? Calculate the difference in returns to justify your answer.\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"hard\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"This question falls under the subtopic of 'Applications of Compound Interest: Investments, Loans, and Annuities' within the broader topic of 'Quants - Simple Interest and Compound Interest'. It requires understanding compound interest, different compounding periods, and making investment decisions. \\n\\nHere's how to solve it:\\n\\n**Step 1: Calculate the Future Value for Option A after 2 years**\\n\\n* Interest rate per compounding period: 10% annual / 2 (semi-annual) = 5%\\n* Number of compounding periods: 2 years * 2 (semi-annual) = 4\\n* Formula: Future Value (FV) = Present Value (PV) * (1 + interest rate)^number of periods\\n* FV = $50,000 * (1 + 0.05)^4 = $60,775.31\\n\\n**Step 2: Calculate the Future Value for Option B after 2 years**\\n\\n* Interest rate per compounding period: 9.5% annual / 12 (monthly) = 0.00792 (approximately)\\n* Number of compounding periods: 2 years * 12 (monthly) = 24\\n* Formula: FV = PV * (1 + interest rate)^number of periods\\n* FV = $50,000 * (1 + 0.00792)^24 = $60,322.51\\n\\n**Step 3: Compare the Returns and Calculate the Difference**\\n\\n* Option A yields $60,775.31 after 2 years.\\n* Option B yields $60,322.51 after 2 years.\\n\\nTherefore, Option A would yield a higher return by $60,775.31 - $60,322.51 = $452.80, even though the investment is locked in for 3 years.\\n\\n**Reasoning:**\\nThis question is tricky because it involves different compounding periods and requires the student to make a decision based on a specific time frame. Though Option A has a lower interest rate, the semi-annual compounding results in a slightly higher return after two years. However, the entrepreneur must consider the three-year lock-in period for Option A if they anticipate needing access to funds before the term ends.\"\n  \"options\": [\n    \"Option A is better by $510.25\",\n    \"Option B is better by $420.15\",\n    \"Both options yield the same return\",\n    \"Option A is better by $452.80\",\n    \"Option B is better by $395.60\"\n  ],\n  \"correct_option\": \"Option A is better by $452.80\"\n}\n```",
