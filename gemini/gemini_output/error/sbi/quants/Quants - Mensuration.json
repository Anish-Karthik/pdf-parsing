What should the radius and height of the can be to minimize the amount of aluminum used in its construction?\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"medium\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"## Reasoning:\\n\\nThis question falls under the category of 'Optimization Problems involving Mensuration' as it requires finding the optimal dimensions (radius and height) of a cylinder to minimize its surface area (amount of aluminum) given a fixed volume (amount of sauce).\\n\\n**1. Formulate Equations:** \\n\\n* **Volume Constraint:**  The volume of a cylinder is given by  V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. We know V = 500 cm\u00b3. So:\\n   \\n   500 = \u03c0r\u00b2h\\n\\n* **Objective Function:**  We want to minimize the surface area (S) of the cylinder, which is given by:\\n\\n    S = 2\u03c0r\u00b2 + 2\u03c0rh  (Two circular bases + the curved surface)\\n\\n**2. Express S in terms of a single variable:**\\n\\n   From the volume constraint equation, we can express h in terms of r: \\n   \\n   h = 500 / (\u03c0r\u00b2)\\n\\n   Substitute this expression for h into the surface area equation:\\n\\n   S = 2\u03c0r\u00b2 + 2\u03c0r (500 / (\u03c0r\u00b2))\\n   S = 2\u03c0r\u00b2 + 1000/r\\n\\n**3. Find the critical points:**\\n\\n    To minimize S, we need to find its critical points.  We do this by taking the derivative of S with respect to r and setting it equal to zero:\\n\\n    dS/dr = 4\u03c0r - 1000/r\u00b2 = 0\\n\\n    Solving for r:\\n\\n    4\u03c0r\u00b3 = 1000\\n    r\u00b3 = 250/\u03c0\\n    r = (250/\u03c0)^(1/3) cm\\n\\n**4.

The second derivative, d\u00b2S/dr\u00b2, is positive for this value of r, confirming it's a minimum.\\n\\nTherefore, to minimize the amount of aluminum used, the can should have a radius of (250/\u03c0)^(1/3) cm and a height of 2 * (250/\u03c0)^(1/3) cm.\"\n},\n\"option and correct options\": {\n  \"options\": [\n    \"Radius = 5 cm, Height = 10 cm\",\n    \"Radius = (250/\u03c0)^(1/3) cm, Height = (250/\u03c0)^(1/3) cm\",\n    \"Radius = (250/\u03c0)^(1/3) cm, Height = 2*(250/\u03c0)^(1/3) cm\",\n    \"Radius = 2*(250/\u03c0)^(1/3) cm, Height = (250/\u03c0)^(1/3) cm\"\n  ],\n  \"correct_option\": \"Radius = (250/\u03c0)^(1/3) cm, Height = 2*(250/\u03c0)^(1/3) cm\"\n}\n```\n",

The great circle perpendicular to AB is like the 'equator' of the sphere. The cuts are vertical planes that just touch this 'equator' at opposite sides of the sphere.\n\n  2. **Shape of the Removed Pieces:** Each cut removes a spherical cap. These caps are not hemispheres, but smaller pieces due to the tangent nature of the cuts.\n\n  3. **Remaining Shape:**  The remaining object is difficult to visualize directly.  However, we can think of what's been *removed*. Two identical spherical caps are cut off. The shape left behind is the portion of the sphere that *would be enclosed* if you took those two caps and placed their flat faces together.  \n\n  4. **Symmetry to the Rescue:** This remaining shape is symmetrical. A single cut through the center of this shape, along the original diameter AB, would divide it into two identical halves. Each half is a shape formed by taking a spherical cap and 'flipping' it so its curved surface is facing inward.\n\n  5. **Calculating the Volume:**  \n     * **Volume of a Sphere:** (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 \n     * **Volume of a Spherical Cap:**  (\u03c0h\u00b2/3)(3r - h), where r is the sphere's radius and h is the height of the cap. \n     * **Finding 'h':** This is the trickiest part. We need geometry and the Pythagorean theorem. Consider a cross-section of the sphere through the cut and the center. This forms a right triangle. The hypotenuse is the sphere's radius (10 cm), one leg is the radius of the circular base of the cap (5 cm, since the cut is tangent to the 'equator'), and the other leg is (r - h). Using the Pythagorean theorem: 10\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 + (10 - h)\u00b2.

A plane intersects the cone, passing through the sphere's center and forming a chord of length 12 cm on the sphere's circular cross-section.  What is the area of the resulting cross-section formed by the plane intersecting the cone?\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"hard\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"**1. Visualize the Scenario:** Imagine a sphere perfectly nestled inside a cone, their centers aligned. A plane slices through both, creating a circular cut on the sphere and a tricky shape on the cone.\n\n  **2. Key Insight:** The plane cuts the sphere through its center, meaning the chord it forms is a diameter of the circular cross-section on the sphere.\n\n  **3. Finding the Radius of the Sphere's Cross-section:** Since the chord (diameter) is 12 cm, the radius of the sphere's circular cross-section is 6 cm.\n\n  **4. Relating to the Cone:** Now, focus on the cone. The plane cuts through it, and we need to find the area of that cut. This cut is tricky - it's not a simple circle or triangle. \n\n  **5. Using Similar Triangles:**  Draw a diagram of the cone's cross-section. You'll see that the plane cut forms a triangle inside the cone. This triangle is similar to the larger triangle formed by the cone's height, radius, and slant height.\n\n  **6. Setting Up a Proportion:**  Let the radius of the cone's base be 'R' and the height of the cone be 'H'.  The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal.  Therefore:\n\n   6 (radius of sphere's cross-section) / R (radius of cone) = H - 10 (height of smaller triangle) / H (height of larger triangle)\n\n  **7. Using Pythagorean Theorem:**  We also know that the slant height of the cone is the hypotenuse of the larger triangle. So:\n\n  R^2 + H^2 = (slant height)^2 \n\n  Since the sphere is inscribed, the slant height also passes through the point where the sphere touches the cone.  This forms another right triangle, with sides R, H-10, and 10 (radius of sphere). So:\n\n  R^2 + (H-10)^2 = 10^2\n\n  **8. Solving the System of Equations:** We now have two equations with two unknowns (R and H). Solve for R and H. This will give you the dimensions of the cone.\n\n  **9. Calculating the Area:**  Now that you have R and H, you can find the area of the cone's cross-section.  It's the area of the larger triangle minus the area of the smaller triangle (formed by the sphere's cross-section).\n\n  **The calculations involved in solving the system of equations and finding the area are lengthy but straightforward. The key is the visualization and setting up the correct geometric relationships.**\"\n}\n``` \n",
