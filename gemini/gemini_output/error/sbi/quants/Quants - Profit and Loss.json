She charges $50 per grooming session.  Variable costs per session, including supplies and travel, average $15. To cover an upcoming van repair, Sarah wants to make an extra $200 in profit this month. How many pet grooming sessions must she complete to achieve this goal?\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"medium\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"## Breaking Down Sarah's Profit Goal\\n\\n**1. Calculate the target profit:**\\n\\n* Sarah's usual goal is to break even, meaning her profit is $0.  \n* This month, she wants an additional $200 in profit.\n* Therefore, her target profit for the month is $200.\n\n**2. Determine the contribution margin per unit:**\n\n* Contribution margin is the amount each sale contributes towards covering fixed costs and profit. \n* It's calculated as: Selling Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit\n* In Sarah's case: $50 (selling price) - $15 (variable cost) = $35 contribution margin per grooming session\n\n**3. Calculate the break-even point in units (for her target profit):**\n\n* Break-even point (in units) = (Fixed Costs + Target Profit) / Contribution Margin per Unit\n* For Sarah: ($400 (fixed costs) + $200 (target profit)) / $35 (contribution margin) = 17.14 \n\n**4. Round up to the nearest whole number:**\n\n* Since Sarah can't perform fractions of grooming sessions, we round up to the nearest whole number.\n* Sarah needs to complete 18 grooming sessions to reach her goal. \n\n**Therefore, the answer is 18.**\"\n}\n```",

He follows a unique investment strategy: for every year an investment remains unrealized (not yet resulting in a profit or loss), he mentally calculates the required annual return to double his money in the subsequent year.  He recently invested $500,000 in a company. After 3 years without any return, he's now hoping for a significant profit in year 4. What is the *minimum* annual growth rate (compounded annually) that the startup needs to achieve in year 4 for the venture capitalist to double his initial investment based on his 'doubling' rule?\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"hard\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Here's how to solve this problem:\\n\\n**Understanding the Problem**\\n\\nThe venture capitalist wants to double his money in year 4 after 3 years of no return. Since his 'doubling' rule applies for each year the investment remains unrealized, the required growth in year 4 is impacted by the three preceding years.\\n\\n**Setting up the Equation**\\n\\nLet:\\n* 'x' be the minimum required annual growth rate in year 4\\n\\nSince he wants to double his investment, the final amount after year 4 should be $1,000,000.

The number of years it takes to double an investment at a constant growth rate is related to the logarithm base 2 of 2 (which equals 1 in this case).

Calculate the cost of each metal in the alloy:**\\n* Since the ratio is 5:3:2, let's assume the jeweler uses 5 grams of gold, 3 grams of silver, and 2 grams of platinum.\\n* Cost of gold: 5 grams * $60/gram = $300\\n* Cost of silver: 3 grams * $5/gram = $15\\n* Cost of platinum: 2 grams * $100/gram = $200\\n\\n**2. Calculate the total cost of the alloy:**\\n* Total cost: $300 + $15 + $200 = $515 \\n\\n**3. Calculate the desired selling price before the silver devaluation:**\\n* Profit margin: 25% of $515 = $128.75\\n* Desired selling price: $515 + $128.75 = $643.75\\n\\n**4. Calculate the new cost of silver after devaluation:**\\n* Silver devaluation: 10% of $5/gram = $0.50/gram\\n* New cost of silver: $5/gram - $0.50/gram = $4.50/gram\\n* New cost of 3 grams of silver: 3 grams * $4.50/gram = $13.50\\n\\n**5. Calculate the new total cost of the alloy:**\\n* New total cost: $300 + $13.50 + $200 = $513.50\\n\\n**6. Calculate the new profit required to maintain the 25% margin:**\\n* New profit required: 25% of $513.50 = $128.375\\n\\n**7. Calculate the new required selling price:**\\n* New selling price: $513.50 + $128.375 = $641.875\\n\\n**8. Calculate the percentage change in selling price:**\\n* Price difference: $643.75 - $641.875 = $1.875\\n* Percentage change: ($1.875/$643.75) * 100% = 0.29% (approximately)\\n\\n**Therefore, the jeweler needs to decrease the selling price of the alloy by approximately 0.29% to maintain his desired profit margin.**\"\n}\n``` \n",
