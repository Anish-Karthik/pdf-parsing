Calculate the day of the first meeting in February:**\\n\\n* January has 31 days. \\n* From January 1st (Tuesday) to the end of January there are 30 days (31 - 1 = 30).\\n*  30 days contain 4 full weeks and 2 extra days (30 / 7 = 4 remainder 2). \\n* So, the last day of January is Thursday (counting two days from Tuesday).\\n* Therefore, February 1st falls on a Friday. \\n\\n**2. Calculate the date of the fourth meeting:**\\n\\n* The team meets every 10 days. \\n* Their fourth meeting will be 30 days after their first meeting (3 * 10 = 30).\\n* The fourth meeting will be on March 2nd (February has 29 days in a leap year: 1 + 30 = 31, 31-29=2). \\n\\n**3. Calculate the day of the seventh meeting:**\\n\\n* The seventh meeting is 30 days after the fourth meeting (3 * 10 = 30).\\n*  30 days contain 4 full weeks and 2 extra days (30 / 7 = 4 remainder 2).\\n* Counting two days from Friday, the seventh meeting will be on a Sunday.\\n\\n**Therefore, the correct answer is Sunday. However, this option is not provided. This highlights the importance of carefully checking all steps in a multi-step problem.**\"\n}\n``` \n",

However, the provided options only include weekdays.  Therefore, the correct option is \"None of the above\". \n"

            "question": "```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"A rare celestial alignment occurred on a Friday in the year 1648. This alignment occurs on the same calendar date every 64 years due to a complex interplay of astronomical cycles.  Given that the year 2000 was a leap year, on what day of the week will this celestial alignment next occur after the year 2028?\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"tricky 9/10\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Here's how to solve this problem:\\n\\n**1. Calculate the target year:**\\n   * The alignment last occurred in 1648 + (64 years * 5) = 1968.\\n   * The next occurrence after 2028 is 1968 + 64 years = 2032.\\n\\n**2. Determine leap years between the reference point (2000) and the target year (2032):**\\n   * There are 32 years between 2000 and 2032.\\n   * Within this period, we have leap years in: 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024, 2028, and 2032.\\n   * That's a total of 8 leap years.\\n\\n**3. Calculate the total days shift:**\\n   * Each leap year adds an extra day, shifting the day of the week by one.\\n   * With 8 leap years, the shift is 8 days.\\n\\n**4. Calculate the remaining day shift after considering the leap years:**\\n   *  We have 32 years between 2000 and 2032.\\n   *  Excluding the 8 leap year days, we have 32 - 8 = 24 days of regular shift.\\n\\n**5. Calculate the total day shift from 2000 to 2032:**\\n    * Total shift = leap year shift + regular shift = 8 days + 24 days = 32 days \\n\\n**6. Determine the day of the week shift:**\\n   * Every 7 days complete a week.\\n   * A 32-day shift represents 4 full weeks and 4 extra days (32 / 7 = 4 remainder 4).\\n\\n**7. Determine the day of the week in the target year:**\\n   * The reference year (2000) was a leap year, and the alignment was on a Friday.\\n   * Shifting forward 4 days from Friday, we land on Tuesday.\\n\\n**Therefore, the celestial alignment will next occur on a Tuesday.**\\n\",\n  \"options\": [\n    \"Sunday\",\n    \"Monday\",\n    \"Tuesday\",\n    \"Wednesday\",\n    \"Thursday\"\n  ],\n  \"correct_option\": \"Tuesday\"\n}\n```",
