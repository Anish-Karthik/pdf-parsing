Z would only be the son-in-law of Y if he were married to Y's child.\\n* **The reason is incorrect.** Brothers-in-law are related through marriage, not through blood.  One brother-in-law is married to the sister of the other brother-in-law. They don't necessarily share the same relationship with their spouses' parents. For example, one brother-in-law could be married to the mother's side, while the other is married to the father's side. \\n\\n**Therefore, both the assertion and the reason are flawed, making option (e) the correct answer.**\"\n} \n",

Second cousins share a great-grandparent but not a grandparent. \\n\\nTherefore, the relationship between E and C is that of **second cousins**.\",\n  \"options\": [\n    \"Brother and Sister\",\n    \"First Cousins\",\n    \"Second Cousins\",\n    \"Uncle and Niece\"\n  ],\n  \"correct_option\": \"Second Cousins\"\n}\n``` \n",

We've created four options based on the relationships mentioned in the reasoning and the question. \n\n* **Brother and Sister:** This relationship is not possible based on the given family tree.\n* **First Cousins:** This is incorrect as E and C are second cousins, not first cousins.\n* **Second Cousins:** This is the **correct** relationship as identified in the reasoning.\n* **Uncle and Niece:** This relationship is also not possible as E is not the brother of C's parent. \n"

Therefore, options \"Brother\" and \"Cousin\" are both correct. \n* **Incorrect Options:**\n    * **Uncle:** J cannot be N's uncle because J is younger.\n    * **Nephew:** J cannot be N's nephew because J is older or of the same generation.  \n\n**Justification:**\n\nThe options and correct option are derived directly from the reasoning provided in the text.
