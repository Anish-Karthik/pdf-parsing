Sarah is about to roll.  Do we have enough information to determine if Sarah will win on her next roll?\\n\\nStatement 1: Sarah needs a 5 or higher on at least one die to land on a bonus space.\\n\\nStatement 2: This is Sarah's third turn.\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"easy\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Here's the breakdown:\\n\\n* **Understanding Data Sufficiency:** We need to determine if the statements provide enough information to answer the question definitively, not whether they guarantee Sarah will win.\\n\\n* **Analyzing the Question:** We need to know if Sarah will roll doubles. \\n\\n* **Statement 1:**  This statement is irrelevant. It tells us about a bonus space, not about the probability of rolling doubles.\\n\\n* **Statement 2:**  This statement is also irrelevant. Knowing it's Sarah's third turn doesn't tell us anything about her dice roll.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Neither statement provides information about the probability of Sarah rolling doubles. Therefore, the answer is (E).\\n\\n**Options:**\\n(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient but statement 2 alone is not sufficient.\\n(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient but statement 1 alone is not sufficient.\\n(C) Both statements together are sufficient, but neither statement alone is sufficient.\\n(D) Each statement alone is sufficient.\\n**(E) Statements 1 and 2 together are not sufficient.**\"\n}\n``` \n",

The options provided reflect the standard format for Data Sufficiency questions. \n"
