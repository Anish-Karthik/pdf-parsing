The premises don't give us enough information to conclude this. While some mammals lay eggs,  we don't know if dogs are part of that group. \\n* **(b) No dogs lay eggs.**  We can't definitively conclude this either. The information provided doesn't rule out the possibility of egg-laying dogs. \\n* **(c) All mammals that lay eggs are dogs.** This is too extreme. The premises only tell us that *some* mammals lay eggs; it doesn't restrict egg-laying to dogs within the mammal category.\\n\\n**Therefore, (d) None of the above is the correct answer. ** The given premises don't allow us to definitively reach any of the other conclusions. \"\n}\n``` \n",

Here's how to break down the logic: \\n\\n* **Premise 1:** This sets up a conditional statement: IF comedy, THEN Sarah is happy. \\n* **Premise 2:** We are told Sarah is NOT happy. \\n* **Conclusion:**  Since Sarah's happiness was DEPENDENT on watching a comedy (from Premise 1), and she ISN'T happy, we can logically conclude they DID NOT watch a comedy. \\n\\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\\n* **(a)** This directly contradicts the conclusion we reached.\\n* **(c)** We can't assume Sarah's overall feeling about comedies, only that her happiness in this situation was tied to watching one.\\n* **(d)** This is irrelevant and not deducible from the premises.\\n* **(e)**  This introduces new information not supported by the premises. \"\n}\n``` \n",
