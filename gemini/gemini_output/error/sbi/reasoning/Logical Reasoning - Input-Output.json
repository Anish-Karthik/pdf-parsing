Our goal is to find if we can determine Input 1 with the given statements.\\n\\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\\n\\n* **Statement 1:** Tells us the output is 10, but doesn't reveal anything about the inputs.\\n* **Statement 2:** Tells us Input 2 is 4, but we don't know the output or Input 1.\\n\\n**Combining the Statements:**\\n\\nLet's use both statements together. We can work backward from the output:\\n\\n1. **Output:** 10. Since this is the result after dividing by 2 (Operation 3), the value before division must have been 10 * 2 = 20.\\n2. **Operation 2:** This result (20) was obtained by adding Input 2 (4) to the result of Operation 1. Therefore, the result of Operation 1 must be 20 - 4 = 16.\\n3. **Operation 1:** This result (16) was obtained by multiplying Input 1 by 3. So, Input 1 must be 16 / 3.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nBy combining both statements, we can uniquely determine the value of Input 1 (which is 16/3). Therefore, the answer is (C). \"\n}\n```",
