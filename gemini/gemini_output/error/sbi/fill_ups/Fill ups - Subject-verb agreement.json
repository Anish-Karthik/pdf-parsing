The focus is on identifying the subject and ensuring the verb agrees with it in number.\n* **Medium:** These questions become more complex with longer sentences, multiple clauses, and potentially ambiguous subjects. Students need to carefully analyze the sentence structure to identify the subject and the verb that should agree with it.\n* **Hard:** The hardest questions involve complex sentence structures, nested relative clauses, and more subtle grammatical choices that might confuse students. They require a deep understanding of subject-verb agreement and relative clauses.\n\n**Remember:** Always ensure that the answer choices are grammatically plausible and provide a challenge to the student's understanding.",
