            "question": "```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"Everyone in the class was invited to the party, ____  the twins who were out of town.\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"easy\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The sentence is about excluding the twins from the party invitation. The preposition 'except' is used to exclude something or someone from a group or general statement. 'Besides' implies adding something to a group, while 'including' means adding someone or something to a group. 'With' doesn't indicate exclusion. Therefore, 'except' is the correct preposition for this context.\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"The museum had an impressive collection of ancient artifacts, ____  a few pieces that were temporarily on loan to another institution.\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"medium\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The sentence states that a few pieces are missing from the museum's collection because they are on loan. 'Except' is used to indicate exclusion from a group or statement. 'Besides' implies adding to a group, 'among' implies something is part of a group, and 'for' is used for purpose or reason. Therefore, 'except' is the most accurate preposition for the context, highlighting that a few pieces are missing from the collection.\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"The team celebrated their victory, ____  the coach who was noticeably absent from the festivities due to a family emergency.\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"hard\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"This sentence describes the coach's absence during the team's victory celebration. 'Apart from' is the most appropriate preposition to express this exclusion, indicating the coach's absence despite the team's celebration. 'Beyond' implies going past something, 'Other than' can express a general difference, and 'Save for'  indicates something singular that is different. These options don't convey the idea of being absent from a specific activity. Therefore, 'Apart from' accurately reflects the coach's exclusion from the celebration.\"\n}\n```",

The preposition 'despite' is used to show this contrast. 'Despite' means 'in spite of' or 'notwithstanding.' The other options are incorrect because they indicate cause and effect, not contrast. 'Because' suggests that the bad weather caused the great time, which is not the case. 'Since' indicates a reason or time frame, which doesn't apply here.\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"They decided to go hiking ______  their lack of experience in the mountains. \\n\\n A. instead of \\n B. because \\n C. despite\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"medium\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The sentence shows a contrast between the decision to hike and the lack of experience.  'Despite' is the correct preposition as it introduces the contrasting element of the lack of experience. The other options are not suitable. 'Instead of' would imply a substitution for hiking, and 'because' suggests a reason for the decision, not a contrasting factor.\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"The team played aggressively, ______ their coach's instructions to focus on defense. \\n\\n A. instead of \\n B. despite \\n C. rather than\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"hard\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The sentence highlights the contrast between the team's aggressive play and the coach's instructions. 'Rather than' is the most accurate preposition because it emphasizes the contrast between the two actions. 'Instead of' could be used, but 'rather than' is more precise in expressing the direct opposition between the team's behavior and the coach's orders. 'Despite' doesn't capture the direct opposition as strongly as 'rather than'.\" \n}\n``` \n",

We use 'in' to refer to general periods of time, such as mornings, afternoons, evenings, and nights.  The sentence describes a routine activity that happens during the mornings, not at a specific time within the morning. Therefore, 'in' is the appropriate preposition to use.\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"Complete the sentence with the correct preposition of time: \\\"The concert will begin ___ 8:00 p.m. on Friday.\\\"\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"easy\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The correct preposition is 'at'.  We use 'at' to indicate a specific time, such as a particular hour. The sentence specifies the exact time of the concert's beginning, which is 8:00 p.m., making 'at' the appropriate preposition.\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"Complete the sentence with the correct preposition of time: \\\"The deadline for the project is ___ the end of the month.\\\"\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"medium\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The correct preposition is 'at'.

'Through' is used to indicate a period of time, especially when the action extends from beginning to end. The sentence describes continuous work during the entire night, making 'through' the best choice to represent this duration.\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"Complete the sentence with the correct preposition of time: \\\"The train leaves ___ the first of every month, ensuring we have a timely shipment.\\\"\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"hard\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The correct preposition is 'on'.  While 'on' is commonly associated with specific dates, it can also be used with ordinal numbers to signify a specific day within a month.

The sentence focuses on the *manner* in which the artist paints, emphasizing the meticulous and delicate nature of their technique.  \n\n  * **'With'** is the correct preposition. It accurately conveys the *means* or *instrument* by which the artist achieves the delicate touch. It highlights the close connection between the artist's hand and the brushstrokes.\n\n  * **'Through'** implies movement or passage, not a specific technique.\n  * **'By'** is commonly used to express the agent or means of an action, but it doesn't adequately convey the delicate nature of the touch.\n  * **'In'** suggests a state or location, not a specific manner of execution.\n\n  The phrase 'a delicate touch' is crucial to understanding the correct preposition. It necessitates a preposition that emphasizes the *method* of application, and 'with' best fulfills this requirement.\",\n  \"options\": [\n    {\n      \"option\": \"through\",\n      \"is_correct\": false\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"with\",\n      \"is_correct\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"by\",\n      \"is_correct\": false\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"in\",\n      \"is_correct\": false\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
