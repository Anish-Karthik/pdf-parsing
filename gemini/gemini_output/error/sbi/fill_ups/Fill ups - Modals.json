While 'will' indicates a willingness to do something, it feels too straightforward and doesn't convey the implied condition of confidentiality. 'Shall' is too formal and archaic for this situation. 'Would' expresses a willingness conditional on the team's agreement to confidentiality, making it the most appropriate choice in this context. It also reflects the Professor's polite but firm stance on the matter. Therefore, 'would' is the best option to fill the blank in the sentence.\"\n  \"options\": [\n    {\n      \"option\": \"will\",\n      \"is_correct\": false\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"would\",\n      \"is_correct\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"shall\",\n      \"is_correct\": false\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"should\",\n      \"is_correct\": false\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
