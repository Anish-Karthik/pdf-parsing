This makes it easy for students to identify the need for a definite article.\n* **Difficulty:** The question is marked as \"easy\" as it involves a common organization with a straightforward article usage.\n* **Reasoning:** The explanation clarifies the concept of using \"the\" with specific institutions and organizations, making the question more educational. \n\nLet's examine the other difficulties:\n\n**Medium:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"My friend works at ___ International Committee of the Red Cross, an organization dedicated to humanitarian aid.\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"medium\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The correct article is \\\"the\\\" because \\\"International Committee of the Red Cross\\\" is a specific organization with a unique purpose.

The sentence refers to a specific report, the well-known European Union, and a set of regulations that are inherently specific to the European Union context. The choice of \\\"the\\\" in each case signifies a specific, unique entity or concept.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Question:** This question involves multiple instances of article usage within a more complex sentence, requiring students to analyze the context and understand the specific nature of each noun phrase.\n* **Difficulty:** The difficulty level is \"hard\" as the student needs to consider the specific nature of each noun phrase within the sentence, requiring a deeper understanding of article usage rules and context. \n",
