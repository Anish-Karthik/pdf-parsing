The correct answer is 'extremely' because it strengthens the adjective 'boring' to indicate a high level of boredom.

'Always' is the best fit because it suggests the speaker makes an effort to find time consistently. 'Sometimes' is incorrect because it implies the speaker plays games only occasionally. 'Never' is incorrect because it implies the speaker never plays games.

'Always' is incorrect because it suggests the train is always on time, contradicting the sentence's meaning.  'Never' is incorrect because it suggests the train never leaves on time.

This implies that they went to bed earlier than usual.  Of the options provided, 'early' best describes this situation as it indicates a time earlier than expected. The other options are not relevant to the context: 'quickly' refers to speed, 'recently' refers to a time in the past, and 'quietly' refers to a manner of action.\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"The train ______ arrived at the station, causing a slight delay for other passengers. \\n a) finally \\n b) immediately \\n c) often \\n d) yesterday\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"medium\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The sentence mentions a slight delay, implying that the train's arrival was not on time. This eliminates 'immediately' as it suggests an on-time arrival.  'Often' is incorrect because it refers to a regular occurrence, not a specific instance. 'Yesterday' also doesn't fit as it indicates a specific past day, while the sentence refers to a recent event.

'Eventually' best captures this nuance, as it suggests something happening after a delay. 'Sometimes' is incorrect because it refers to a general frequency, not a specific instance.

The sentence implies a light and playful movement, making 'happily' the most fitting adverb.  The other options, 'loudly' and 'quickly', don't convey the same sense of joy and carefree skipping.  'Sadly' is entirely inappropriate, as it suggests a negative emotion.

'Slowly' is the best choice because it captures the gentle and deliberate ticking of the clock, contrasting with the fast pace of modern life. 'Loudly' and 'nervously' don't fit the context, as the ticking is described as quiet and steady. While 'angrily' could suggest a sense of urgency, it doesn't accurately describe the slow and measured ticking.

The word 'danced' implies a graceful and expressive movement. Of the options, 'effortlessly' best captures this sense of fluid and skilled movement. 'Carelessly' contradicts the description of intricate details.  'Angrily' suggests a forceful and uncontrolled movement, which doesn't align with the sentence's imagery. 'Slowly' would suggest a meticulous and deliberate movement, while the sentence implies a more dynamic and expressive approach.
