Ensure the question is engaging, challenging, and appropriate for the specified difficulty level.\n\n**Question Structure:**\n\n* **Sentence with a blank:**  The question should present a sentence with a single blank where the student must choose the correct word or phrase to complete the sentence grammatically and meaningfully.\n* **Multiple Choice Options:** Provide four options for the blank, including one correct answer and three incorrect distractors. Distractors should be plausible but grammatically incorrect or semantically inappropriate.\n\n**Difficulty Level:** \n\n* **Easy (5/10):**  The blank should be relatively straightforward, requiring basic knowledge of word order and common sentence structures. The distractors should be obviously incorrect. \n* **Medium (7/10):**  The blank might require a slightly deeper understanding of subject-verb agreement, pronoun case, or other grammatical concepts. The distractors could be subtly incorrect.\n* **Hard (9/10):** The blank should require a sophisticated understanding of grammatical rules, sentence structures, and potentially the nuances of word order. The distractors should be very cleverly incorrect, making them difficult to distinguish from the correct answer. \n\n**Example (Easy 5/10):**\n\n**Topic:** Word Order and Sentence Fluency\n\n**Question:** The dog  _______  in the park. \n\n**Options:**\n* A) plays\n* B) play \n* C) played\n* D) playing\n\n**Difficulty Level:**\n\n* **Hard (9/10):** \n\n**Topic:** Word Order and Sentence Fluency\n\n**Question:** After  _______ the ingredients, the chef carefully measured them.\n\n**Options:**\n* A) to gather\n* B) gathering\n* C) gathered\n* D) gathers\n\n**Note:** \n\n* Ensure that the difficulty level is aligned with the complexity of the question. \n* Choose distractors carefully to reflect common errors or misconceptions students might have. \n* The sentence should be concise and grammatically correct, with the blank logically placed within the sentence structure. \n\n\n##  Example JSON Output: \n\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"The dog  _______  in the park.\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"easy\",\n  \"options\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"plays\",\n      \"isCorrect\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"play\",\n      \"isCorrect\": false\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"played\",\n      \"isCorrect\": false\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"playing\",\n      \"isCorrect\": false\n    }\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"The correct answer is 'plays' because it is the present tense form of the verb 'play' and agrees with the subject 'dog' in the sentence.

            "question": "## Example 1: \n\n**Topic:** Using Correct Pronoun Cases \n\n**Skills:** Identifying the correct pronoun case (nominative or objective) in a complex sentence structure.\n\n**Question:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"The teacher gave ______ and the other students a pop quiz, which caught everyone off guard.\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"tricky\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The correct pronoun is 'me' because it is the object of the preposition 'to.' The sentence structure might be confusing as it includes a compound object ('me' and 'the other students') which can lead students to incorrectly choose 'I' as the subject of the sentence. However, the main verb 'gave' has the compound object 'me and the other students,'  making 'me' the correct choice in the objective case.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Options and Correct Option:** \n\n```json\n{\n  \"options\": [\n    \"A. I\",\n    \"B. Me\", \n    \"C. Myself\"\n  ],\n  \"correct_option\": \"B. Me\"\n} \n```\n\n## Example 2:\n\n**Topic:** Using Correct Pronoun Cases\n\n**Skills:**  Identifying the correct pronoun case when the pronoun is part of a compound subject.\n\n**Question:** \n\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"______ and the principal are attending the school board meeting this afternoon.\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"tricky\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The correct pronoun is 'She' because it is part of the compound subject 'She and the principal.'  The subject of the sentence is performing the action of attending the meeting, and therefore the pronoun needs to be in the nominative case.  The options 'Her' and 'Hers' are in the possessive case and are grammatically incorrect in this context.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Options and Correct Option:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"options\": [\n    \"A. Her\",\n    \"B. She\", \n    \"C. Hers\"\n  ],\n  \"correct_option\": \"B. She\" \n}\n``` \n\n**Explanation of the Difficulty Level:**\n\nBoth examples are considered \"tricky\" because the sentence structure is complex and requires careful analysis to determine the correct pronoun case. Students might be tempted to choose incorrect options based on superficial understanding of pronoun cases. \n",
