In this case, the doctor is summoning the patient's family to discuss the treatment plan. \n\nHere's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **Called off:** This means to cancel something. It doesn't fit the context of summoning the family.\n* **Called out:** This means to criticize someone publicly.

This doesn't fit the context of excitement and losing control.\n* **carry on:** To carry on means to continue doing something.

In this context, the team had to stop working on the project because they realized it was unachievable. \n\n The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the context of the sentence.

This indicates the need for a phrasal verb that conveys the meaning of continuing or persisting. Of the options provided, 'set out' is the most suitable choice. 'Set out' is a phrasal verb that means to start working on something or to embark on a journey, which aligns with the team's determination to complete the project.",

The phrasal verb 'carry away' means to be overwhelmed by emotion, usually excitement or enthusiasm. In this case, the news of the promotion caused the person to feel so happy and surprised that she was momentarily unable to speak.  \n\nHere's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **carried off:** This phrasal verb usually implies successfully completing a task or achieving something difficult. It does not fit the context of being overwhelmed by emotion.\n* **carried on:** This phrasal verb means to continue doing something, often in an enthusiastic or determined way. It does not relate to the feeling of being surprised and speechless.\n* **carried out:** This phrasal verb means to perform or complete a task.

This is because the sentence implies that the CEO is resistant to adopting a new idea or direction, which is the opposite of picking up on a new vision or strategy. The other options are not appropriate in this context: \n\n* **'pick out'** implies choosing or selecting something specific from a group, which is not relevant to the sentence. \n* **'pick on'** means to tease or bully someone, which is completely unrelated. \n* **'pick at'** means to eat something in a small, hesitant way, or to criticize something in a minor way.

Let's analyze the choices:\n\n* **Give up** means to stop trying or making an effort, which aligns with the context of the sentence. \n* **Go off** means to explode or to leave a place suddenly, which doesn't fit the context. \n* **Go over** means to examine something carefully or to repeat something, also irrelevant to the sentence. \n* **Go through** means to experience something difficult or to examine something in detail, while it's relevant to the setbacks, it doesn't accurately portray the entrepreneur's determination to continue. \n\nThe sentence implies that the entrepreneur was persistent and didn't abandon his dream even after encountering challenges.

The sentence describes the architect's determination to stick with his design despite pressure, indicating he wasn't willing to abandon his vision.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **Give in** implies yielding to pressure or persuasion. While the architect faced pressure, he didn't yield to it, he stood his ground.\n* **Give off** means to emit or produce something, usually a smell, light, or heat.
