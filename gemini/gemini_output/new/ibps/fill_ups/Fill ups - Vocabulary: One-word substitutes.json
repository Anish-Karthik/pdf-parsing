The word \"intransigent\" means refusing to change one's opinion or course of action, making it the perfect one-word substitute for the blank. Other options like \"dogmatic\" or \"unyielding\" could also fit, but \"intransigent\" captures the specific nuance of stubbornly holding onto a belief in the face of evidence. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Context:** The sentence describes a scientist who holds onto their belief despite contradictory evidence. This suggests a strong, unwavering belief. \n2. **Find the One-Word Substitute:** The one-word substitute needs to convey the stubbornness and refusal to change one's opinion. \n3. **Consider Synonyms:**  \"Dogmatic\" and \"unyielding\" are synonyms for \"intransigent\". However, \"intransigent\" has a stronger connotation of stubborn resistance to evidence and logic. \n4. **Verify the Fit:**  \"Intransigent\" fits the context perfectly, conveying the scientist's rigid adherence to their belief even when faced with conflicting evidence.",
