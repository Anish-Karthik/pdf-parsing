            "difficulty": "easy",
            "reasoning": "The sentence is about children playing with toys.  The toys belong to the children, so we need a possessive pronoun that indicates plural possession. 'Their' is the correct possessive pronoun for plural ownership, as it refers to the children. The sentence would then read: 'The children played with their toys in the park.'",

            "difficulty": "easy",
            "reasoning": "The pronoun in this sentence is the object of the verb 'gave.'  The object of a verb always takes the objective case. Since 'he' is the nominative case and 'him' is the objective case, the correct pronoun is 'him.' This is because the coach is giving the game plan *to* him, not *to* he. ",

            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "The correct answer is \"This\" because it refers to the pair of shoes that is being specifically mentioned in the sentence, \"this pair is blue\". \"That\" is used to refer to something farther away, which isn't the case here. \"These\" and \"Those\" are used for plural nouns, and the sentence is talking about one pair of shoes.

'Whom' is used as the object of a verb or preposition, and 'what' refers to things or ideas. 'Which' is used to choose between specific options. Therefore, the correct answer is 'who.'",

In the second blank, we need a pronoun that refers to the dog, and since the dog is the subject of the sentence, we use the nominative pronoun \"it.\" The sentence would be grammatically incorrect if we used \"his\" or \"her\" because the dog is not a person.

            "reasoning": "The sentence describes an action where the subject (the little girl) is both the performer and the receiver of the action. This indicates the need for a reflexive pronoun.

The sentence is straightforward and the relationship between the clauses is clear: the book is the object of the verb 'borrowed' and the pronoun 'that' refers to the book.

Since we don't know the gender of the person, the most appropriate option is 'he' as it's the generic singular pronoun.  If the sentence was 'She went to the store' or 'He went to the store', then those would be the correct answers.

The sentence is in the active voice, meaning the subject ('teacher') is performing the action ('gave'). The object receiving the action is 'him', therefore requiring the objective case pronoun.  The sentence would be incorrect if it used 'he' because 'he' is in the nominative case and is used for subjects, not objects.  \n\nStep 1: Identify the verb: 'gave'\nStep 2: Identify the direct object: 'him'\nStep 3: Determine the case: 'him' is in the objective case\nStep 4: Choose the correct pronoun: 'him' is the correct pronoun in the objective case.",

The sentence asks about a favorite subject, and 'What' is the appropriate pronoun to use when asking about something.

The pronoun we need to fill in the blank should refer to both the puppy and the kitten.

The sentence is comparing the new smartphone's battery life to the *battery life of its predecessor*. The other pronouns provided are incorrect: \"it\" is a subject pronoun, \"their\" is a plural possessive pronoun, and \"them\" is an object pronoun.

The correct pronoun is 'him' because it refers to a male student.  The pronoun 'he' would be incorrect because it is in the nominative case.

The pronoun needs to replace the ball as the object of the verb 'lost sight of'.  Since 'ball' is an inanimate object, the correct pronoun is 'it'. The other options are incorrect because they refer to people.",

The pronoun \"herself\" is a reflexive pronoun, indicating that the action of admiring is being performed by the same person who is being admired.  \n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n* \"himself\" refers to a male person, not the old woman.\n* \"themselves\" refers to multiple people, not a single person.\n* \"themself\" is an incorrect reflexive pronoun; it does not exist in the English language.",
