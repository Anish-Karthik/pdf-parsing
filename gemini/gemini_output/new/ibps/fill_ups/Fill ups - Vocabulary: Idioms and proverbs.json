      "difficulty": "medium",
      "reasoning": "The proverb \"Many hands make light work\" emphasizes the power of teamwork and cooperation in making a task easier. This means that when multiple people work together, the burden is shared, and the task feels less heavy. \n\nThe sentence speaks about a daunting task, suggesting a significant challenge that might seem overwhelming.  The blank space requires an idiom or proverb that reflects the idea of working together to reduce the difficulty of the task.\n\nThe most fitting proverb in this context is \"Many hands make light work.\" This proverb directly aligns with the sentiment expressed in the sentence, emphasizing the benefit of shared effort in tackling a challenging task.  \n\nThe other options may not be as directly relevant or accurate:  \n\n* **The early bird catches the worm:**  This proverb refers to the importance of being proactive and taking advantage of opportunities, not necessarily about teamwork.  \n\n* **Don't put all your eggs in one basket:** This proverb encourages diversification and risk management, not directly related to teamwork.  \n\n* **Practice makes perfect:** This proverb highlights the importance of dedication and repetition for achieving mastery, not the collaborative aspect of task completion.\n\n Therefore, \"Many hands make light work\" is the most appropriate proverb to complete the sentence and align with the meaning of the provided proverb.",

      "reasoning": "The idiom \"lost his head\" means to become confused or panicked, which fits the context of the sentence describing a disastrous presentation. The speaker's stumbling over words and appearing confused indicates they lost their composure.  \n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **\"Put his foot in his mouth\"** means to say something inappropriate or embarrassing, which doesn't fit the scenario of a disastrous presentation. \n* **\"Got cold feet\"** means to become afraid or hesitant, usually about something they were going to do, which doesn't align with the speaker's behavior. \n* **\"Put his back into it\"** means to work hard at something, which is the opposite of what the speaker did in the presentation. \n\nTherefore, \"lost his head\" is the only idiom that accurately describes the speaker's state during the presentation.",

The antique shop owner appears like a typical, quirky collector, but in reality, he is a shrewd businessman. This situation is perfectly captured by the proverb \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\" The proverb highlights the importance of looking beyond appearances to understand the true nature of a person or situation. The other options are not relevant to the scenario.  \n\n* **a) All that glitters is not gold:** This proverb refers to the deceptive nature of outward beauty or wealth. It doesn't fit the scenario where the owner's appearance is unassuming, not glamorous. \n* **b) A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush:** This proverb focuses on the value of immediate gains over potential future rewards.

This aligns with the idiom 'The thirst for knowledge' which encapsulates the desire and drive to learn and expand one's understanding. The other options are less relevant to the context of the proverb and its modified sentence. 'A stitch in time saves nine' focuses on the value of timely action, not the pursuit of knowledge.

The proverb emphasizes choosing certainty over potential gains.  \n2.

The phrase \"single bird\" emphasizes the security of what you have, making it a better choice than the risky prospect of two birds in the bush. \n5.
