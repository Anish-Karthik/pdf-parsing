            "difficulty": "easy",
            "reasoning": "The correct preposition is 'with'.  The sentence is describing the manner in which the dog wagged its tail. 'With' indicates the cause or accompaniment of the action. The phrase 'with excitement' explains why the dog wagged its tail. Therefore, the complete sentence is: 'The dog wagged its tail with excitement.'",

            "difficulty": "easy",
            "reasoning": "The correct preposition is 'in'. The phrase '___ the competition' indicates that the team is part of the competition, and 'in' expresses inclusion or being part of something. The other options do not fit the context: 'at' implies a specific location, 'with' suggests accompaniment, and 'on' suggests a surface or position.",

            "reasoning": "This question assesses the understanding of prepositions used to describe position relative to other objects.  The correct preposition for the first blank is \"on\" because the vase is physically resting on the surface of the bookshelf. The second blank requires the preposition \"above\" because the vase is located higher than the stack of books.

            "reasoning": "This question focuses on the preposition of place describing the book's location. The sentence implies the book is positioned on a flat surface, and the preposition 'on' accurately depicts this relationship. It signifies the book's position in direct contact with the table's surface. The phrase 'next to the lamp' further reinforces this understanding, placing the book in a specific area on the table.",

It establishes a causal relationship between the children's excitement and their trip to the amusement park.  Other options are incorrect because they don't express the reason for the excitement: \n\n* 'for' indicates a purpose or duration.\n* 'in' suggests a location or state.\n* 'on' indicates a surface or time.",

The preposition 'except' signifies exclusion, indicating that the grandmother was the only one who did not go.  The other options are incorrect: 'besides' suggests additional information, 'but' implies contrast, and 'save' is archaic and not commonly used in this context.",

            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "The question tests the student's understanding of prepositions that express contrast or difference. The sentence describes a situation where two things are in direct opposition - twins raised in the same environment having vastly different personalities. The correct preposition of contrast to fill the blank is \"yet\". \"Yet\" indicates that despite the shared environment, the twins' personalities are in contrast to each other.",

It emphasizes the elegance and poise of the ballerina's movements.  The other options are not as suitable: 'noisily' would imply a loud and disruptive dance, 'angrily' suggests a forceful and aggressive performance, and 'lazily' implies a lack of effort and energy, all of which contradict the description of a graceful ballerina.",

            "reasoning": "The correct preposition is 'whose'. The sentence is describing a house with a snowy roof. 'Whose' indicates possession and is used to connect the roof to the house. 'Whose' is the possessive pronoun that replaces the phrase 'the roof of which'. Therefore, the correct answer is 'whose'.",

            "reasoning": "The sentence describes an action that happens regularly but not every weekend. The preposition 'sometimes' accurately reflects the frequency of the action. The other options are not suitable in this context.  'Always' suggests they meet every weekend, which contradicts the statement about busy schedules. 'Never' is completely opposite to the statement. 'Usually' implies a higher frequency than the sentence suggests.",

            "reasoning": "The sentence requires a preposition of exclusion to indicate that the rookie player's performance was different from the rest of the team.  Of the options, 'except for' is the most appropriate preposition to express this exclusion. \n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n* **except for:**  This preposition is used to specifically exclude something or someone from a group or a statement.  It's the most common and accurate choice here.\n\n* **besides:** This preposition typically means 'in addition to' and wouldn't fit the context of excluding the rookie's performance. \n\n* **despite:** This preposition indicates something happening in spite of another factor.  It's not relevant to the sentence's focus on exclusion. \n\n* **including:** This preposition emphasizes inclusion, the opposite of what the sentence intends to convey.",

The other prepositions, 'in', 'at', and 'above', don't accurately represent the spatial relationship between the herbs and the cutting board. 'In' would imply the herbs are inside the board, 'at' would imply they are near it, and 'above' would imply they are higher than the board.",

'Despite' is the appropriate preposition of contrast to connect these contrasting elements. It indicates that the excitement existed even though the initial part was slow-paced.  \n\nThe other options are incorrect as they do not express contrast:\n\n* 'In' is used for location or a state of being.\n* 'During' implies something happening within a specific time period.\n* 'Because of' suggests a causal relationship, not a contrast.",

The correct preposition here is 'with' as it indicates that the children were accompanied by their parents. 'With' is used to show that two or more people are together in a particular place or doing a particular activity.  Other options are not suitable in this context.  'By' is used to indicate the means of transportation or the agent performing an action, 'at' is used to indicate a location, and 'for' is used to indicate a purpose or reason.

            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "The correct preposition is \"under\".  The sentence describes a cat hiding beneath the couch, which is a location 'below' the couch.  The preposition \"under\" accurately conveys this spatial relationship.",

'During' is used to indicate an event happening within a specific period of time. \n\n* **'On'** is used for specific days or dates. \n* **'In'** is used for months, seasons, or years. \n* **'At'** is used for specific times.  \n\nTherefore, 'during' is the most appropriate preposition to express the duration of the conference within the last week of September.",

The other options do not convey the same sense of movement. 'Through' implies passing through something, 'around' means circling, and 'in' signifies being inside something.  'Over' correctly describes the action of leaping across the fence, hence it's the right answer.",

            "reasoning": "The sentence suggests that the grandmother remembers some things from her childhood but not everything.  This implies she doesn't remember *always* or *never* her childhood. The phrase 'but she tells stories about it quite often' indicates that she remembers things *sometimes*. Therefore, the correct preposition of frequency is 'sometimes'.",

The context suggests a movement that follows the contours of the mountainside, not a direct upward climb. \n\nHere's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **Across:**  'Across' implies movement from one side to the other, usually in a straight line. It doesn't fit the context of following a winding path.\n* **Over:** 'Over' indicates movement from one side to the other, passing above something. This is not applicable to a mountainside.\n* **Into:**  'Into' suggests entering a space or place.

'Inside' and 'among' are the most suitable prepositions to convey this idea. 'Inside' signifies the puppy being within the blankets, while 'among' suggests the puppy is surrounded by cushions within the blanket pile.  \n\n'In' and 'between' are incorrect choices. 'In' could be used but doesn't effectively convey the specific environment within the blankets. 'Between' suggests the puppy is positioned between two objects, not within a pile.\n\n'On' and 'next to' are also incorrect as they imply a position on top of or alongside something, not within or surrounded by something. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 'inside, among'.",

The path winds its way behind the waterfall, suggesting that it passes through an area where the waterfall is a prominent feature in the background.  The other options are not appropriate.  'Next to' implies that the path runs parallel to the waterfall, while 'around' suggests the path circles the waterfall, neither of which aligns with the description of a path winding its way through the jungle.

'On' is the correct preposition here, signifying that the eclipse starts on a particular date.  \n\n2. **___ the peak occurring ___ 1:30 AM**: The second blank requires a preposition that connects the peak of the eclipse to a specific time. 'At' is the correct preposition, signifying that the peak occurs at a precise point in time.  \n\n3. **___ the peak occurring ___ 1:30 AM**:  The third blank requires a preposition that connects the peak of the eclipse to a larger timeframe within the date. 'Around' or 'at' are acceptable prepositions here, as they both denote a time period surrounding the peak of the eclipse.  \n\nTherefore, the complete sentence would read: \"The next lunar eclipse will occur *on* midnight *on* the 23rd of August, *at* (or *around*) the peak occurring *at* 1:30 AM.\"",

For example: \"The ancient civilization's demise was because of a series of devastating volcanic eruptions.\" However, the current sentence structure uses \"attributed to\" to establish the cause-and-effect relationship. \n\n* **\"in spite of\"** - This preposition indicates contrast, which is not the intended meaning in this sentence. \n\n* **\"due to\"** - While \"due to\" can indicate a cause, it's typically used with a noun or noun phrase. In this case, the cause is a series of events, making \"to\" more appropriate. \n\n* **\"despite\"** - Similar to \"in spite of\", this preposition indicates contrast and doesn't fit the meaning of the sentence. \n\nThe correct answer is **\"to\"** as it effectively establishes the direct link between the volcanic eruptions and the civilization's demise.",

'Unlike' best captures this nuance, implying a difference, while 'in contrast to' is a phrase used to highlight a strong contrast.  The other options, 'same as' and 'alike',  suggest a greater degree of similarity than the sentence indicates. Therefore, 'unlike' is the most accurate preposition to complete the sentence.  \n\nStep-by-step reasoning: \n1. The sentence suggests a comparison between the team's performance in the current season and their performance in the previous season.\n2.  The sentence implies a difference or contrast between the two seasons due to the new coach and roster changes. \n3. 'Unlike' best captures the meaning of a contrast or difference between two things.  \n4.  'Similar' and 'comparable' imply a greater degree of similarity, which is not suggested in the sentence.  \n5.
