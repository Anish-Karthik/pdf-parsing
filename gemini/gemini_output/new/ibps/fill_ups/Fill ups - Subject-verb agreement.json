The answer choices must reflect these nuances. \n\nLet's break down the sentence and analyze each blank:\n\n1. **___ of the students in the debate club ___ passionate about advocating...**\n- \"None\" is the subject and it is singular because it refers to a single concept, i.e., not a single student but the lack of any student. \n- Therefore, the correct verb is \"is\" (singular present tense).\n\n2. **...yet ___ of them have found the time to dedicate...**\n- \"None\" is the subject and it is plural because it refers to a group of students who have not found the time.\n- Therefore, the correct verb is \"have\" (plural present tense).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer choices should reflect these two different verb usages for \"none\" in the sentence, depending on the context.",
