            "reasoning": "The sentence expresses uncertainty about the train's possible delay. \"May\" is the most appropriate modal to convey this possibility, as it suggests a less certain chance compared to \"might\" or \"could\".  The phrase \"but it's not certain\" further strengthens the use of \"may\" for a less definite possibility. Therefore, \"may\" is the correct answer. ",

Therefore, \"mustn't\" is the correct choice for this sentence.  The other options, \"can't\" and \"shouldn't\", while expressing prohibition, are less forceful than \"mustn't\" and don't convey the same level of urgency or danger.  \n\n**Step 1:** Identify the context of the sentence.

In this case, \"Mustn't\" best conveys the strong prohibition implied by the sentence. \n**Step 4:**  Verify the logical reasoning and correctness of the choice.

The context is clear, making it straightforward to choose the appropriate modal.  \"May\" is the most common and polite modal used when asking for permission.

            "reasoning": "The correct answer is \"have to\". The sentence emphasizes the doctor's instruction, making it a necessity for the speaker to take the medication. \"Have to\" is used when something is required or obligatory, often because of an external rule or instruction.

The modal 'might' is used to express this possibility, which is not certain but still plausible. 'May' could also be used, but 'might' slightly emphasizes the uncertainty. 'Could' is less suitable because it implies ability, not probability. Therefore, 'might' is the most appropriate modal to convey the intended meaning.",

The modal verb 'have to' is the most appropriate choice to convey the obligation to eat more fruits and vegetables for health reasons.  'Need to' could also be used, but 'have to' implies a stronger sense of requirement.  'Must' would be too strong in this context, as it suggests an absolute imperative, which is not the case here.  The doctor's advice is strong, but not absolute. Therefore, 'have to' is the most fitting modal verb to express the necessary action.",

The sentence implies that the child was capable of riding a bicycle at a young age, suggesting a past ability. Therefore, 'could' is the correct modal verb to fill the blank.  \n\nHere is a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **Can:**  'Can' is used to express an ability in the present. The sentence refers to a past ability, not a present one. \n\n* **Be able to:**  While 'be able to' can express both past and present abilities, it is generally used in more formal contexts.  'Could' is a more natural choice in this case. \n\n* **Will be able to:** 'Will be able to' expresses a future ability. This sentence focuses on a past ability.",

The correct answer is 'would rather' because it emphasizes a stronger personal preference, while 'would prefer' implies a more gentle inclination.  The context also indicates that the speaker's preference is stronger, as they are willing to compromise to include their sister's desire.  \n\nTherefore, the complete sentence should be: 'My sister would rather go to the art museum, but I would rather spend the afternoon at the park and have a picnic.'

'May' suggests a general possibility, 'might' suggests a slightly lower probability, and 'could' suggests a potential outcome.  In this context, 'could' is the most appropriate choice because it implies a potential outcome that is more dependent on the action of staying off the ankle.

While all modals could fit grammatically, 'should' best expresses the strong suggestion of taking action based on the doctor's advice. 'Could' might imply possibility, but the context suggests a strong recommendation. 'Might' implies uncertainty, which doesn't fit the doctor's advice.

            "reasoning": "The correct modal verb here is \"have to.\" The context implies that the speaker is obligated to take the medication as instructed by the doctor. \"Must\" is also possible but less likely in this case as it suggests a stronger obligation or necessity. \"Will\" is incorrect because it expresses future intention, not a present obligation. \n\nHere's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **Must:** While \"must\" can express obligation, it often implies a stronger internal feeling of necessity. In this case, the obligation comes from the doctor's instructions, making \"have to\" a more appropriate choice. \n* **Will:** This modal expresses future intention or certainty. The sentence doesn't indicate the speaker's future plans regarding the medication, but rather their present obligation to take it. \n\nTherefore, \"have to\" is the most accurate option to reflect the speaker's obligation based on the doctor's instructions.",

While \"can\" expresses the ability to give up the seat, and \"will\" expresses a willingness to do so, \"would\" is the most appropriate modal for making a polite offer in this context.

Of the options, 'might' best expresses this uncertainty. 'May' is also possible, but 'might' conveys a slightly higher degree of doubt.

The sentence expresses certainty about the chosen one's characteristics based on the prophecy.  \n\n* 'Must' is used to express a strong obligation or necessity, often based on a rule, law, or in this case, a prophecy.  The prophecy states the chosen one *must* have these abilities, implying it's a non-negotiable requirement.\n\n* 'Will' would suggest a future action or prediction, not a necessary requirement. \n\n* 'Have to' implies a more general obligation, not a specific necessity based on a prophecy.",

            "reasoning": "The question is designed to be tricky because it tests the subtle nuances of 'would' and 'will' in a situation requiring both politeness and willingness. While 'will' implies a stronger commitment and certainty, 'would' conveys a more tentative and polite offer, aligning better with the desire not to intrude on Mrs. Thompson's privacy. The choice of 'would' also implies a willingness to help if she accepts, making it the most appropriate modal in this context.  \n\n**Detailed Breakdown** \n\n* **'Will'** implies a stronger, more definitive commitment. It suggests a willingness to help regardless of her response. In this scenario, it might come across as forceful or intrusive, especially considering Mrs. Thompson's reclusive nature.  \n\n* **'Would'** conveys a softer, more polite offer. It suggests a willingness to help if she requests it, respecting her autonomy and avoiding pressure. This is crucial in the context of the neighbor's reclusive nature. \n\n* **'Shall'** is a formal modal, generally used in requests or offers involving a more significant commitment. While it implies willingness, it's not the best fit for this casual, neighborly interaction.  \n\nTherefore, 'would' is the most appropriate modal in this context, demonstrating willingness to help while remaining respectful and considerate of the neighbor's preference.",

The city council's lack of support is the primary reason for the failure. This implies that the architect was unable to achieve their goal, even with their experience.  The modal 'could' is used to express ability that was not realized or that was limited by external factors. It conveys the idea that the architect had the potential but was unable to achieve the desired outcome due to the council's decision. The other modals do not fit the context. 'Can' implies present ability, which is not relevant here. 'Might' suggests uncertainty, which is not the case, as the outcome is definitively stated.
