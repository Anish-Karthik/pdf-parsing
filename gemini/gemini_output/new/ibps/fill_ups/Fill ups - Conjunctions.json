      "reasoning": "The sentence establishes a contrast between the positive online reviews and the negative experience of the food. The conjunctive adverb needs to express this contrast.

We need a conjunction to connect the two independent clauses. The conjunction 'while' best fits the sentence, indicating that the cat's napping and the dog's chasing occurred simultaneously, with the second action causing the cat's annoyance.  The other options are not suitable: 'and' would simply combine the two actions without indicating a contrasting or simultaneous relationship, 'but' suggests a contrasting relationship which is not present in the sentence, and 'because' implies a cause-and-effect relationship which is not the case here.",

The conjunction 'However' is the correct answer because it shows a contrast between the cat chasing the mouse and the mouse escaping. The sentence 'The cat chased the mouse through the house' implies that the cat was successful in its pursuit, but the sentence 'the mouse was able to escape through a hole in the wall' contradicts that.

The conjunctive adverb should connect these two ideas, showing that the rain led to the cancellation.  Of the available options, 'therefore' is the most suitable choice.  'Therefore' implies a direct consequence, indicating that the cancellation was a direct result of the rain. The other options do not accurately reflect the cause and effect relationship.  'However' introduces a contrast, 'meanwhile' indicates a simultaneous occurrence, and 'nevertheless' suggests a contrast despite the cause. Therefore, 'therefore' is the correct answer.",

The sentence describes two simultaneous events, the sun shining and birds singing, indicating a connection between them. The conjunction 'and' is the most suitable option because it joins two independent clauses that express similar ideas, creating a compound sentence.

      "reasoning": "The question focuses on identifying a conjunctive adverb that shows sequence, indicating the order of actions in the sentence.  The sentence describes the artist's process: first sketching, then adding color.  We need a conjunctive adverb that emphasizes this progression.  \n\nThe correct conjunctive adverb is \"then,\" as it explicitly signifies the second action in the sequence, following the first action of sketching.  \n\nOther options, such as \"finally,\" \"subsequently,\" and \"accordingly,\" don't convey the sequential flow of the artist's actions in the sentence. \"Finally\" implies a sense of conclusion, while \"subsequently\" and \"accordingly\" suggest a result or consequence, which are not relevant to the sequence of actions described.",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "reasoning": "The sentence pair describes a situation where the old house being empty for years is the reason why people believe it's haunted and avoid going inside.  This relationship is best expressed by a conjunction showing cause and effect. Of the provided options, only 'because' accurately reflects this connection, indicating that the emptiness of the house is the reason for the belief in its haunting.\n\n**Step 1:** Analyze the relationship between the sentences. The first sentence introduces the house and its location, while the second sentence introduces the belief in its haunting.  The two sentences are connected by a cause and effect relationship, where the emptiness of the house is the reason for the belief in its haunting.\n\n**Step 2:** Identify conjunctions that express cause and effect.  Common conjunctions for cause and effect include 'because,' 'since,' and 'as.'\n\n**Step 3:** Choose the most suitable conjunction based on the context.  'Because' is the most natural and appropriate choice for this specific context. 'Since' and 'as' while they can express cause and effect, are less common and might sound less natural in this sentence.\n\n**Step 4:**  Verify the sentence with the chosen conjunction.  The completed sentence reads: 'The old house stood on a hill overlooking the town, because it had been empty for years. Many people believed it was haunted, and no one dared to go inside.' This sentence flows logically and grammatically, making 'because' the correct conjunction.",

      "reasoning": "The sentence requires two conjunctions to accurately connect the different ideas. The first blank needs a conjunction that indicates a contrast, as the weather conditions posed a challenge despite the hikers' excitement. The correct conjunction here is \"but\" because it shows a contrasting relationship between the hikers' excitement and the difficult conditions. The second blank requires a conjunction that indicates continuation or despite the difficulties, they still reached the top and enjoyed the view. Therefore, the correct conjunction is \"yet\", as it expresses the idea of continuing action despite the challenges. \n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n* **And** - This conjunction doesn't convey the contrast between the hikers' excitement and the challenging conditions. It also wouldn't logically link the two parts of the sentence as it implies a direct consequence or continuation of the same event. \n* **So** - This conjunction implies a consequence of the previous event, suggesting that the weather conditions directly led to a change in the hikers' plans. This is not the case as they still reached the top. \n* **Because** - This conjunction indicates a reason for the following event, suggesting that the challenging weather conditions caused the hikers' excitement. However, the sentence states that they were excited despite the conditions.  \n\nTherefore, the correct conjunctions to fill the blanks are \"but\" and \"yet\".",

Therefore, 'Afterwards' is the correct answer. \n\n The sentence, when completed, reads: \"The ancient civilization meticulously recorded its history on clay tablets; Afterwards, centuries later, archaeologists unearthed these fragile artifacts, providing invaluable insights into a lost world.\" This clearly establishes the temporal sequence of events, making 'Afterwards' the most suitable option.",

The sentence describes two actions: the scientist documenting observations and the assistant compiling data. The actions are parallel and contribute to a shared goal \u2013 project success.

The second clause explains why the treasure was buried in that specific spot, requiring a conjunction of manner. The correct answer is \"beneath\" for place and \"so that\" for manner.  Many students might be tempted to choose \"where\" for the first clause due to the word \"location\" being present, but this is incorrect.

(b) however would indicate a contrast, (c) meanwhile implies simultaneous events, (d) although introduces a concession, and (e) moreover adds further information, which is not relevant to the cause-and-effect relationship.

The sentence conveys a cause-and-effect relationship, indicating the artist's motivation for his meticulous work. While 'since' and 'because' both express cause, they have slightly different nuances. 'Since' emphasizes the time element, suggesting a past action as the cause. It's less appropriate here because the sentence doesn't focus on the time frame of the artist's crafting. 'Because' is more general and directly connects the artist's meticulousness to his eagerness for the exhibition. 'Yet' indicates contrast, which is not present in the sentence. 'Provided that' introduces a condition, which doesn't apply to this scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is 'because', which accurately establishes the causal relationship between the artist's meticulous work and his desire to showcase the painting.",
