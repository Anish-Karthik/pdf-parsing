Understanding the Constraint:**\n\nThe painter only has 6 liters of the lighter shade, which is less than the total required (10 liters).

Setting up the Allegation Cross:**\n\nWe can use the Allegation Cross method to solve this problem.  Draw an 'X' and label as follows:\n\n* **Top:** The desired quick ratio (2.0)\n* **Left Arm:** The lower quick ratio (Arabica - 1.5)\n* **Right Arm:** The higher quick ratio (Robusta - 2.5)\n\n```\n      2.0\n    /   \\\n  1.5     2.5 \n```\n\n**3.

It's designed to be a 'tricky 8/10' difficulty level due to the following factors:\n\n* **Multiple Solutions:** The problem involves mixing three different solutions, making the calculation more complex than using just two. \n* **Constraints:**  The requirement to use all 500ml of the 60% solution and the ratio constraint between the 75% and 90% solutions add an extra layer of difficulty.\n* **Finding Individual Volumes:** The question asks for the specific volumes of the 75% and 90% solutions, not just a ratio, requiring more steps in the solution.\n\n**Here's a step-by-step solution:**\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n    * Let  'x' be the volume (in ml) of the 90% solution.\n    * Since the 75% solution is used twice as much as the 90% solution, its volume is '2x'.\n\n2. **Set up the Alligation Equation:**\n   The total amount of alcohol in the final solution should be equal to the sum of the alcohol amounts from each individual solution.\n\n   * Total alcohol in final solution: 0.70 * (500 + x + 2x) \n   * Alcohol from 60% solution: 0.60 * 500\n   * Alcohol from 75% solution: 0.75 * 2x\n   * Alcohol from 90% solution: 0.90 * x\n\n   The equation becomes: 0.70(500 + 3x) = (0.60 * 500) + (0.75 * 2x) + (0.90 * x)\n\n3. **Solve for x:**\n   * Expand the equation: 350 + 2.1x = 300 + 1.5x + 0.9x\n   * Simplify: 2.1x - 1.5x - 0.9x = 300 - 350\n   * Combine terms: -0.3x = -50\n   * Solve for x: x = -50 / -0.3 = 166.67 ml (approximately)\n\n4. **Calculate the volume of the 75% solution:**\n   * Volume of 75% solution = 2 * x = 2 * 166.67 ml = 333.34 ml (approximately)\n\n**Therefore, the lab should use approximately 166.67 ml of the 90% solution and 333.34 ml of the 75% solution to create the desired hand sanitizer.**",

            "question": "A jeweler is crafting a unique gold alloy for a special order. He has three gold bars with different purities: a 20% gold bar, a 50% gold bar, and a 90% gold bar.  He needs to create 100 grams of a 62% gold alloy.  \n\n**Constraints:**\n* Due to the rarity of the 90% gold bar, the jeweler can use no more than 25 grams of it. \n* To maintain the alloy's workability, at least 30 grams of the 20% gold bar must be used. \n\nWhat is the maximum possible amount of the 50% gold bar the jeweler can use in this mixture while still meeting all requirements?",
            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "This problem falls under the 'Advanced Problems: Mixtures with Constraints' subtopic of 'Quants - Mixtures and Alligations' because it involves mixing different concentrations of gold to achieve a target concentration while adhering to specific usage limitations.  Here's how to solve it:\n\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let 'x' represent the amount (in grams) of the 50% gold bar used.\n* Since we need to maximize 'x', we'll aim to use the minimum amounts of the 20% and 90% bars. \n\n**2.  Set up Equations Based on Constraints:**\n* **Minimum 20% Gold:** 30 grams (given)\n* **Maximum 90% Gold:** 25 grams (given)\n* **Total Weight:** 30 (20% gold) + x (50% gold) + 25 (90% gold) = 100 grams\n\n**3. Solve for 'x' in the Total Weight Equation:**\n* 55 + x = 100\n* x = 45 grams \n\n**4. Check if 45 grams of the 50% bar satisfies the target gold concentration:**\n* Total gold from the 20% bar: 30 grams * 0.20 = 6 grams\n* Total gold from the 50% bar: 45 grams * 0.50 = 22.5 grams\n* Total gold from the 90% bar: 25 grams * 0.90 = 22.5 grams\n* Total gold in the mixture: 6 + 22.5 + 22.5 = 51 grams\n* Gold concentration of the mixture: (51 grams / 100 grams) * 100% = 51%\n\n**5. Adjust the Amounts to Achieve 62% Gold Concentration:**\n* The current mixture has too little gold (51%).  Since we want to maximize the 50% gold bar usage, we'll reduce the amount of the 20% gold bar (which has the lowest gold content).\n* Each gram of 20% gold bar replaced with a gram of 50% gold bar increases the overall gold content by 30% (50% - 20%).\n* We need to increase the gold content by 11% (62% target - 51% current).\n* To achieve an 11% increase, we need to replace (11% / 30% per gram) = 0.3667 grams of the 20% bar for each 1% increase needed. \n* Therefore, we need to replace a total of 0.3667 grams/percent * 11 percent = 4.03 grams of the 20% bar. \n\n**6. Recalculate the Amount of the 50% Gold Bar:**\n* Since we are reducing the 20% bar by approximately 4 grams, the amount of the 50% bar can increase by the same amount to maintain the total weight of 100 grams. \n* The maximum amount of the 50% gold bar the jeweler can use is approximately 45 grams + 4 grams = 49 grams. \n\n**Important Note:**  We made a slight rounding adjustment to the grams of the 20% bar replaced (4.03 grams rounded to 4 grams) to maintain clarity. In a real-world scenario, the jeweler would likely make extremely precise measurements to achieve the exact 62% gold concentration. ",

Visualize the Problem:**\n\n* Draw a horizontal line and mark the desired concentration (40%) in the center.\n* Place the concentrations of the available solutions (10%, 30%, and 50%) on the left side of the line, each on a separate row.\n\n**2.
