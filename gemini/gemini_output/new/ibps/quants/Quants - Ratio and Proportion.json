Convert the weight to grams:**\n\n   Multiply the weight in kilograms by 1000: 3.375 kg * 1000 g/kg = 3375 g\n\n**Therefore, the largest loaf will weigh 3375 grams.**",

The key is that their speeds are in a ratio, and we're interested in the distances they cover *after* they cross paths.\n\n**2. Assign Variables**\n\n* Let Alice's speed be 5x\n* Let Bob's speed be 3x\n* Let the distance Alice covers after crossing Bob be 'a'\n* Let the distance Bob covers after crossing Alice be 'b'\n\n**3. Use the Formula: Time = Distance / Speed**\n\n* We know Alice takes 4 hours to cover 'a' at a speed of 5x:  4 = a / 5x\n* We know Bob takes 9 hours to cover 'b' at a speed of 3x:  9 = b / 3x\n\n**4.

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Magazine Readers:**\n* The ratio of fiction to non-fiction magazine readers is 7:3, meaning that for every 10 magazine readers, 3 read non-fiction.\n* Since 210 residents read non-fiction magazines, they represent 3 parts of the 10-part ratio.\n* To find the value of one part of the magazine reader ratio, divide the number of non-fiction readers by its ratio part: 210 residents / 3 parts = 70 residents per part.\n* Therefore, there are 70 residents/part * 10 parts = 700 magazine readers in total.\n\n**2. Total Residents:**\n* The ratio of newspaper, magazine, and book readers is 5:3:2.\n* We know that 700 residents read magazines, which represents 3 parts of this ratio.\n* To find the value of one part of the total reader ratio, divide the number of magazine readers by its ratio part: 700 residents / 3 parts = 233.33 residents per part (approximately).\n* Finally, to find the total number of residents surveyed, multiply the value of one part by the total parts in the ratio: 233.33 residents/part * (5 parts + 3 parts + 2 parts) = 2333.3 residents (approximately).\n\n**Therefore, approximately 2333 residents were surveyed.**\n\n**Note:** The answer is rounded to the nearest whole number as we cannot have a fraction of a resident.",

However, due to an upcoming festival, they need to finish the tapestry in 32 days. To meet this deadline, they decide to bring in some apprentice weavers. Each apprentice weaver works at 2/3 the speed of a skilled weaver.  What is the minimum number of apprentice weavers they need to hire to complete the tapestry on time?",
            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understand the Inverse Proportion:**\n\n* The number of weavers and the time taken to complete the tapestry are inversely proportional. This means as the number of weavers increases, the time taken decreases, and vice-versa.\n\n**2. Calculate the Workload:**\n\n* Let's assume the total workload of the tapestry is represented by 'W'. \n* We can measure the work rate of one skilled weaver as W/48 (workload divided by the time taken).\n\n**3.  Calculate the Work to be Done in 32 Days:**\n\n* In 32 days, the skilled weavers would complete (32 days / 48 days) = 2/3 of the total work.\n* This means 1/3 of the work (W/3) still needs to be done.\n\n**4. Calculate the Work Rate of an Apprentice:**\n\n* An apprentice works at 2/3 the speed of a skilled weaver, so their work rate is (2/3) * (W/48) = W/72.\n\n**5. Determine the Number of Apprentices:**\n\n* Let 'x' be the number of apprentices needed.\n* The combined work rate of 'x' apprentices in 32 days should equal the remaining workload (W/3).\n* Therefore:  (W/72) * x * 32 = W/3\n* Simplifying: 32x/72 = 1/3\n* Further simplification: 8x/18 = 1/3\n* Cross-multiplying: 24x = 18\n* Solving for x: x = 18/24 = 3/4 \n\n**6.  Find the Minimum Whole Number:**\n\n* Since we cannot have a fraction of an apprentice, we round up to the nearest whole number. \n* Therefore, they need to hire a minimum of 1 apprentice weaver.\n\n**Important Note:**  Even though the calculation results in a fraction, we need a whole number of apprentices. In this context, rounding down would mean they wouldn't finish the tapestry on time. ",

This involves working with ratios, percentages, and a bit of algebra.\n\n**2. Setting up the Equation**\n\nLet 'x' be the percentage of the original yellow pigment used in the adjusted \"Sunset Orange.\"\n\n* **Sunset Orange (Original):** 5 parts yellow : 7 parts red (Total 12 parts)\n* **Sunset Orange (Adjusted):** 5x parts yellow : 7 parts red (Total 5x + 7 parts)\n* **Ocean Blue:** 30% yellow : 70% blue\n* **Tropical Teal (Target):** 40% yellow : 60% other pigments\n\n**3. Calculating Yellow Pigment Contributions**\n\n* **Sunset Orange (Adjusted) contribution to Tropical Teal:** (3/5) * (5x / (5x + 7))\n* **Ocean Blue contribution to Tropical Teal:** (2/5) * 0.30 \n\n**4. Formulating the Equation**\n\nThe sum of yellow pigment contributions from both paints in \"Tropical Teal\" should equal 40%:\n\n[(3/5) * (5x / (5x + 7))] + [(2/5) * 0.30] = 0.40\n\n**5. Solving for x**\n\n* Simplify the equation: (3x / (5x + 7)) + 0.12 = 0.40\n* Subtract 0.12 from both sides: (3x / (5x + 7)) = 0.28\n* Multiply both sides by (5x + 7): 3x = 1.4x + 1.96\n* Subtract 1.4x from both sides: 1.6x = 1.96\n* Divide both sides by 1.6: x = 1.225\n\n**6. Converting to Percentage**\n\nMultiply 'x' by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1.225 * 100% = 122.5%\n\n**Therefore, the manufacturer should use 122.5% of the original amount of yellow pigment in \"Sunset Orange\" to achieve the desired 40% yellow pigment concentration in \"Tropical Teal.\" This means they will need to add more yellow pigment to their original \"Sunset Orange\" mixture.**",
