Calculate the cost price per 900 grams:**\n\n* We need to find out how much the shopkeeper actually paid for 900 grams of rice.\n* Cost price of 1000 grams (1 kg) = Rs. 40\n* Cost price of 1 gram = Rs. 40 / 1000 = Rs. 0.04\n* Cost price of 900 grams = Rs. 0.04 * 900 = Rs. 36\n\n**3.

Define Variables:** \n\n* Let 'x' represent the amount (in ounces) of the less expensive alloy (60% gold) used.\n* Then, (10 - x) represents the amount (in ounces) of the more expensive alloy (80% gold) used.\n\n**2. Set up the Purity Equation:**\n\n* The total gold content in the final necklace should be 70%. We can express this as an equation: \n\n   0.60x + 0.80(10 - x) = 0.70 * 10\n\n**3. Solve for 'x':**\n\n* Simplify and solve the equation:\n   0.60x + 8 - 0.80x = 7\n   -0.20x = -1\n    x = 5 ounces \n\n* Therefore, the jeweler should use **5 ounces** of the less expensive alloy.\n\n**4. Calculate the Cost of Each Alloy Used:**\n\n* Cost of less expensive alloy: 5 ounces * $900/ounce = $4500\n* Cost of more expensive alloy: 5 ounces * $1200/ounce = $6000\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Cost of the Necklace:**\n\n* Total cost = $4500 + $6000 = $10500\n\n**6. Calculate the Selling Price:**\n\n* Profit desired is 25% of the cost price.\n* Profit = 0.25 * $10500 = $2625\n* Selling price = Cost price + Profit = $10500 + $2625 = $13125\n\n**7. Calculate the Profit:**\n\n* Profit = Selling Price - Total Cost = $13125 - $10500 = $2625\n\n**Therefore, the jeweler's profit from selling the necklace will be $2625.**",

            "question": "A fruit vendor buys a batch of mangoes for $60. He aims to make a 25% profit on the entire batch. He initially prices each mango to achieve this profit margin. However, as the day progresses and some mangoes start to ripen quickly, he decides to sell the remaining 40% of the mangoes at a 10% discount to ensure they are sold. What is the vendor's overall profit or loss percentage on the entire batch of mangoes?",
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis question is tricky because it involves multiple calculations and scenarios:\n\n1. **Calculating the target selling price:** The vendor wants a 25% profit on his $60 investment, meaning he wants to earn a profit of $60 * 0.25 = $15. Therefore, his target revenue is $60 + $15 = $75.\n\n2. **Impact of the discount:** Selling 40% of the mangoes at a 10% discount affects the overall revenue. To calculate this, we need to know the original selling price per mango (which we don't). This introduces an element of assumption and careful calculation.\n\n3. **Calculating the actual profit/loss:** We need to find the revenue generated from selling 60% of the mangoes at the original price and 40% at a discount, then compare it to the initial cost price to determine the actual profit or loss percentage.\n\n**Let's break down the calculation (assuming the number of mangoes allows for selling in percentages):**\n\n* **Assume the batch had 100 mangoes.** This is for easier percentage calculation.  You can assume any number.\n* **Target revenue:** $75\n* **Target price per mango:** $75 / 100 = $0.75\n* **Number of mangoes sold at full price:** 100 * 60% = 60 mangoes\n* **Revenue from full-priced mangoes:** 60 * $0.75 = $45\n* **Number of mangoes sold at a discount:** 100 * 40% = 40 mangoes\n* **Discounted price per mango:** $0.75 - ($0.75 * 10%) = $0.675\n* **Revenue from discounted mangoes:** 40 * $0.675 = $27\n* **Total Revenue:** $45 + $27 = $72\n* **Profit:** $72 - $60 = $12\n* **Profit Percentage:** ($12 / $60) * 100 = 20%\n\nTherefore, the vendor's overall profit percentage is **20%**, which is less than his initial target of 25% due to the discounted sales.",
