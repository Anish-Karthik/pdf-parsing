Applying AM-GM:**\n\nThe AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. In this case:\n\n(l + w)/2  >=  \u221a(l * w)\n\nSince 2l + 2w = 100, we know l + w = 50.

Interpretation:**\n\nThis means the maximum possible value of the product of length and width (i.e., the area) is 625 square meters.

Here's how to solve it: \n\n**1. Graphing the Constraints**\n\n* First, we'll need to plot the constraints on a graph where the x-axis represents acres of corn (c) and the y-axis represents acres of soybeans (s).  \n* **c + s <= 200:**  To graph this, find the intercepts. If c=0, then s=200 and if s=0, then c=200. Connect the points (200, 0) and (0, 200). The inequality represents all points below and including this line. \n* **c <= 150:** This is a vertical line at c=150. The inequality represents all points to the left of and including this line.\n* **s <= 120:**  This is a horizontal line at s=120. The inequality represents all points below and including this line. \n* **c >= 0, s >= 0:**  These constraints mean we are only considering solutions in the first quadrant of the graph. \n\n**2. Identifying the Feasible Region**\n\n* The feasible region is the area on the graph where all the constraints are satisfied simultaneously. It is the polygon formed by the intersection of all the shaded areas from the inequalities. \n\n**3. Finding the Optimal Solution**\n\n* The optimal solution lies at one of the vertices (corners) of the feasible region. We need to evaluate the objective function (Profit = 300c + 250s) at each of these vertices to determine which point yields the maximum profit.\n\n    * Vertex 1: (0, 120) - Profit = 300(0) + 250(120) = $30,000\n    * Vertex 2: (80, 120) - Profit = 300(80) + 250(120) = $54,000\n    * Vertex 3: (150, 50) - Profit = 300(150) + 250(50) = $57,500\n    * Vertex 4: (150, 0) - Profit = 300(150) + 250(0) = $45,000\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe farmer will maximize their profit by planting 150 acres of corn and 50 acres of soybeans, resulting in a profit of $57,500.",

Substitute to create a quadratic inequality:**\n\nSubstitute this expression for l in the area formula:\n A = (50 - w) * w = 50w - w\u00b2\n\n**6.  Find the maximum value of the quadratic:**\n\nThe graph of this quadratic equation is a parabola opening downwards.  The maximum value occurs at the vertex. We can find the vertex's x-coordinate (which represents the width, w, that maximizes the area) using:\n w = -b / 2a  (where a = -1 and b = 50 from our quadratic equation)\n w = -50 / (2 * -1) = 25\n\n**7. Check for feasibility:**\n\n* Our calculated width, w = 25, satisfies the constraint w \u2265 5.\n* Substituting w = 25 into l \u2264 50 - w, we get l \u2264 25.  However, the constraint l \u2265 2w requires l to be at least 50, which is not possible. This means we need to adjust our solution.\n\n**8.  Adjusting the solution based on constraints:**\n\n* Since we can't maximize the area at w = 25 due to the length constraint, we need to find the largest possible value of l that satisfies  l \u2265 2w.\n* With w = 25, the smallest possible l is 50. However, this violates l \u2264 50 - w.  \n* We need to decrease w until we find a combination that satisfies all constraints.\n\n**9.  Finding the optimal solution:**\n\n* By trial and error within our constraints, we find that the largest possible width is w = 16.66 (approximately).  \n* This gives us l = 33.33 (approximately), satisfying l \u2265 2w.\n\n**10.  Calculate the maximum area:**\n\n* A = l * w = 33.33 * 16.66 = 555.44 square meters (approximately)\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible area of the pen is approximately 555.44 square meters.",

Here's how we can solve it:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:** \nWe need to find the minimum and maximum possible distances between points X and Z (XZ), given the distances the robotic arm travels between XY and YZ. The constraints on 'a' and 'b' add an extra layer of complexity.\n\n**Applying the Triangle Inequality:**\nThe Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. We can apply this to the three points X, Y, and Z:\n\n1. **XZ < XY + YZ:** This tells us XZ must be less than the sum of the other two sides. Substituting the given values: \n   XZ < (2a + 3b) + (5a - b) \n   XZ < 7a + 2b\n\n2. **XY < XZ + YZ:**  Rearranging to isolate XZ:  XZ > XY - YZ\n   XZ > (2a + 3b) - (5a - b)\n   XZ > -3a + 4b\n\n3. **YZ < XY + XZ:** Rearranging to isolate XZ: XZ > YZ - XY\n   XZ > (5a - b) - (2a + 3b)\n   XZ > 3a - 4b\n\n**Considering the Constraints:**\n*  We know 'a' and 'b' are positive integers, and a > b. This means the smallest possible values for 'a' and 'b' are a = 2 and b = 1.\n*  We need to find the 'tightest' range, so we want the largest possible lower bound and the smallest possible upper bound for XZ.\n\n**Finding the Tightest Range:**\n* **Upper Bound:** The expression '7a + 2b' will always yield a larger value than '3a - 4b'. Therefore, the smallest upper bound for XZ is determined by: XZ < 7a + 2b \n* **Lower Bound:**  The expression '-3a + 4b' could potentially be negative, which isn't physically possible for a distance.  Therefore, the largest lower bound for XZ is determined by: XZ > 3a - 4b \n\n**The answer is therefore: 3a - 4b < XZ < 7a + 2b** \n",
