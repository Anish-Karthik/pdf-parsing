            "reasoning": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis question falls under the topic of 'Equations Involving Surds' and sits at a medium (6/10) difficulty level. Here's why:\n\n**Complexity:** The equation involves two separate surds with different terms under the radical sign, and they are connected through subtraction. Solving this requires manipulating the equation to isolate and square the surds, which adds a layer of complexity. \n\n**Steps to Solve:**\n\n1. **Isolate one surd:** Begin by isolating one of the surds. In this case, adding \u221a(x - 4) to both sides gives: \u221a(2x + 9) = \u221a(x - 4) + 3\n\n2. **Square both sides:**  Squaring both sides of the equation helps eliminate one radical: (\u221a(2x + 9))^2 = (\u221a(x - 4) + 3)^2. This simplifies to: 2x + 9 = x - 4 + 6\u221a(x - 4) + 9\n\n3. **Simplify and Isolate the remaining surd:** Combine like terms and isolate the remaining surd term: x = 6\u221a(x - 4)\n\n4. **Square both sides again:**  Square both sides again to get rid of the remaining radical: x^2 = 36(x - 4)\n\n5. **Solve the quadratic equation:** Expand and rearrange into a standard quadratic equation: x^2 - 36x + 144 = 0.  \n\n6. **Factor the quadratic:** The equation factors nicely to (x - 12)(x - 12) = 0\n\n7. **Solve for x:** This gives a single solution: x = 12\n\n8. **Check for extraneous solutions:** It is crucial to check if the solution is valid by substituting it back into the original equation. In this case, x = 12 satisfies the original equation.\n\n**Therefore, the solution to the equation \u221a(2x + 9) - \u221a(x - 4) = 3 is x = 12.**",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1: Rationalizing the Denominators**\n\n* For each fraction, multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.\n\n  *  \\(\\frac{3 + \\sqrt{7}}{2 - \\sqrt{5}} \\times \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{5}}{2 + \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{(3 + \\sqrt{7})(2 + \\sqrt{5})}{(2)^2 - (\\sqrt{5})^2} = \\frac{6 + 3\\sqrt{5} + 2\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{35}}{-1} = -6 - 3\\sqrt{5} - 2\\sqrt{7} - \\sqrt{35}\\)\n\n  * \\(\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{5}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{7} - \\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{7} - \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{5(\\sqrt{7} - \\sqrt{5})}{(\\sqrt{7})^2 - (\\sqrt{5})^2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{7} - 5\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\)\n\n  * \\(\\frac{2}{2 + \\sqrt{5}} \\times \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{5}}{2 - \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{2(2 - \\sqrt{5})}{(2)^2 - (\\sqrt{5})^2} = \\frac{4 - 2\\sqrt{5}}{-1} = -4 + 2\\sqrt{5}\\)\n\n**Step 2: Combining the Terms**\n\n* Now, substitute the rationalized fractions back into the original expression:\n\n\\((-6 - 3\\sqrt{5} - 2\\sqrt{7} - \\sqrt{35}) - (\\frac{5\\sqrt{7} - 5\\sqrt{5}}{2}) + (-4 + 2\\sqrt{5})\\)\n\n* Combine like terms:\n\n\\(-6 - 4 - 2\\sqrt{7} - \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{2}  - 3\\sqrt{5} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{5}}{2} + 2\\sqrt{5} - \\sqrt{35}\\)\n\n\\(-10 - \\frac{9\\sqrt{7}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} - \\sqrt{35}\\)\n\nTherefore, Algebro's secret code is \\(-10 - \\frac{9\\sqrt{7}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} - \\sqrt{35}\\).",
