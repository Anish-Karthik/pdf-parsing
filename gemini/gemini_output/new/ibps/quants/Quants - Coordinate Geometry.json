Realizing that opposite sides have the same slope, we only need to find the equations of the two diagonals.\n   *  Diagonal 1: Connects the intersection of lines (1) and (2) with the intersection of lines (3) and (4).\n   *  Diagonal 2: Connects the intersection of lines (1) and (4) with the intersection of lines (2) and (3).\n\n3. **Solving Systems of Equations**: To find the intersection points needed for the diagonals, we solve two systems of equations:\n    *  System 1: Equations (1) and (2) to find one endpoint of Diagonal 1. \n    *  System 2: Equations (1) and (4) to find one endpoint of Diagonal 2. \n\n4. **Finding Diagonal Equations**: With one point known for each diagonal, we can use the opposite point's coordinates (from solving the other two systems, which we don't strictly need to do) and the point-slope form to find the equations of the two diagonals.\n\n5. **Final Intersection**: Solve the system of equations formed by the two diagonal equations to find their intersection point, which represents the fountain's location.\n\n**Solution**\n\n* **Diagonal 1 Endpoint (Solving System 1):**\n   Solving 2x - y = 6 and x + 3y = 12 simultaneously (e.g., using elimination) gives us the point (6, 6).\n\n* **Diagonal 2 Endpoint (Solving System 2):**\n   Solving 2x - y = 6 and x + 3y = -3 simultaneously gives us the point (1, -4).\n\n* **Diagonal Equations (using point-slope form):**\n    * Diagonal 1: Passes through (6, 6) and (-3, -3) [we know this without solving the other system]. Its slope is 1. The equation becomes y - 6 = 1(x - 6), simplifying to y = x.\n    * Diagonal 2: Passes through (1, -4) and (4, 1) [again, known without fully solving]. Its slope is 5/3. The equation becomes y + 4 = (5/3)(x - 1), simplifying to y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n\n* **Fountain's Location (Intersection of Diagonals):**\n   Solving y = x and y = (5/3)x - 17/3 simultaneously, we get x = 17/2 and y = 17/2.\n\n**Therefore, the coordinates of the drinking fountain are (17/2, 17/2).**",

            "reasoning": "This question is tricky (8/10 difficulty) because:\n\n1. **Non-standard Application:** It uses a real-world scenario of a whispering gallery, requiring understanding of how hyperbolas relate to sound reflection.\n2. **Missing Information:** It doesn't directly give the vertices' location, requiring calculation using the given distances.\n3. **Multi-step Problem:** It asks for both the hyperbola's equation AND the asymptote's slope, involving multiple concepts.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n* **1. Find key values:**\n    * We know the foci are 50 feet apart, so c = 25 feet (half the distance between foci).\n    * The person standing 14 feet from the wall is 14 feet from one focus and (50-14) = 36 feet from the other. This difference in distances EQUALS 2a, a property of hyperbolas. So 2a = 36, and a = 18 feet.\n* **2. Calculate b:**\n    * We have 'a' and 'c', and the relationship is c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n    * 25\u00b2 = 18\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n    * b\u00b2 = 301, so b = \u221a301\n* **3. Hyperbola Equation:**\n    * Since the transverse axis is horizontal and the center is at the origin, the standard form is (x\u00b2/a\u00b2) - (y\u00b2/b\u00b2) = 1\n    * Plugging in our values: **(x\u00b2/324) - (y\u00b2/301) = 1**\n* **4. Asymptote Slope:**\n    * For a horizontal hyperbola, the slopes are \u00b1(b/a)\n    * Slope = \u00b1(\u221a301 / 18) \n    * **Therefore, the slope of one asymptote is (\u221a301 / 18) and the other is -(\u221a301 / 18)**",

This requires calculating the magnitude of AB first, using the Pythagorean theorem:  \u221a((-5)^2 + (-3)^2) = \u221a34. Then, the magnitude of AC is 2\u221a34.\n\n3. **Using Trigonometry with Vectors:** The 60-degree angle between the vectors introduces trigonometry.

Assume the Earth and the monitoring station lie on the major axis of the satellite's elliptical orbit.",
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n**1. Visualize the Situation:**\n\nImagine the Earth at one focus of the ellipse. The apogee and perigee distances tell us the shape of the ellipse. Since the monitoring station is 20,000 km away from the Earth's center, it lies somewhere along the major axis between the Earth and the satellite's apogee.\n\n**2. Key Ellipse Properties:**\n\n* **Major Axis:**  The line segment passing through both foci and connecting the farthest points on the ellipse (apogee and perigee in this case). \n* **Distance Property:** The sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant. \n\n**3. Finding the Major Axis:**\n\n* The distance from one focus to the apogee is 25,000 km.\n* The distance from that same focus to the perigee is 15,000 km.\n* Since the sum of these distances is constant for all points on the ellipse, the major axis length is 25,000 km + 15,000 km = 40,000 km.\n\n**4. Finding the Distance from the Other Focus to the Perigee:**\n\n* The distance between the two foci is the major axis length minus twice the distance from one focus to the apogee: 40,000 km - 2(25,000 km) = -10,000 km.  The negative sign indicates we've overshot the other focus; the actual distance is 10,000 km.  This also tells us that the Earth is the focus closer to the perigee.\n\n**5. Finding the Distance from the Other Focus to the Monitoring Station:**\n\n* The distance from the Earth (one focus) to the monitoring station is 20,000 km. \n* The distance between the foci is 10,000 km.\n* Therefore, the distance from the other focus to the monitoring station is 20,000 km - 10,000 km = 10,000 km.\n\n**6. Using the Distance Property:**\n\n* Let 'x' be the distance from the satellite to the monitoring station when it's directly overhead.\n* The distance from the satellite to the other focus is 10,000 km.\n* Using the distance property of ellipses: x + 10,000 km = 40,000 km (the constant sum of distances to the foci)\n\n**7. Solving for x:**\n\n* x = 40,000 km - 10,000 km = 30,000 km\n\n**Therefore, the distance between the satellite and the monitoring station when the satellite is directly overhead is 30,000 km.**",
