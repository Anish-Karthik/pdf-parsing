They currently split profits and losses evenly.\n**new_partner**: Their friend, Tom, is interested in joining the bakery.

            "reasoning": "## Reasoning: \n\nThis question is classified as 'easy' due to the straightforward calculation of goodwill and the clear relationship between Tom's desired profit share and his investment. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Calculate Tom's implied total capital balance:**\n\n* Tom wants a 25% share of profits, implying the total capital after his admission should reflect this proportion.\n* Calculation: $70,000 (Tom's investment) / 0.25 (Tom's desired profit share) = $280,000 (Total Implied Capital)\n\n**2.  Calculate Goodwill:**\n\n* Goodwill represents the excess of the implied total capital over the sum of existing capital and the new partner's investment.\n* Calculation: $280,000 (Total Implied Capital) - $80,000 (Sarah's Capital) - $60,000 (Emily's Capital) - $70,000 (Tom's Investment) = $70,000 (Goodwill)\n\n**3. Determine the adjusted capital balances:**\n\n* **Sarah:** $80,000 (Existing Capital) + ($70,000 (Goodwill) x 0.5 (Sarah's Profit Share)) = $115,000\n* **Emily:** $60,000 (Existing Capital) + ($70,000 (Goodwill) x 0.5 (Emily's Profit Share)) = $95,000\n* **Tom:** $70,000 (Investment) = $70,000 (Since his investment aligns with his profit share, he doesn't receive a portion of goodwill).\n\n**Therefore, the answer is:**\n\n* Goodwill: $70,000\n* Sarah's Adjusted Capital: $115,000\n* Emily's Adjusted Capital: $95,000\n* Tom's Adjusted Capital: $70,000 ",

It's tricky (8/10) because: \n\n1. **Varying Time Periods:**  Capital investments and withdrawals happen at different times (initially, after six months, after a year). \n2. **Complex Profit Sharing Ratios:** The profit-sharing depends on a weighted average capital contribution calculated *quarterly*, making it more complex than simple ratios.\n3. **Capital Adjustments:**  Chloe adds capital, while Blake withdraws, requiring adjustments in their respective capital calculations.\n4. **Multiple Calculations:** The solution involves numerous steps: calculating weighted average capital for each partner per quarter, then for the entire year, and finally determining individual profit shares. \n\n**Here's a step-by-step solution:**\n\n**1. Calculate Weighted Average Capital for each Partner per Quarter:**\n\n* **Alex:**\n    - Remains constant at $150,000 throughout the year.\n* **Blake:**\n    - Q1 & Q2: $100,000 \n    - Q3 & Q4: $80,000 (after withdrawal)\n* **Chloe:**\n    - Q1 & Q2: $50,000\n    - Q3 & Q4: $150,000 (after additional investment)\n\n**2. Calculate Weighted Average Capital for the entire year:**\n\n* **Alex:**  ((150,000 * 1) + (150,000 * 2) + (150,000 * 3) + (150,000 * 4)) / (1+2+3+4) = $150,000\n* **Blake:**  ((100,000 * 1) + (100,000 * 2) + (80,000 * 3) + (80,000 * 4)) / (1+2+3+4) = $88,000\n* **Chloe:**  ((50,000 * 1) + (50,000 * 2) + (150,000 * 3) + (150,000 * 4)) / (1+2+3+4) = $110,000 \n\n**3. Calculate Profit Share Percentages:**\n\n* **Total Weighted Average Capital:** $150,000 + $88,000 + $110,000 = $348,000\n* **Alex:** ($150,000 / $348,000) * 100% = 43.10%\n* **Blake:** ($88,000 / $348,000) * 100% = 25.29%\n* **Chloe:** ($110,000 / $348,000) * 100% = 31.61%\n\n**4. Determine Individual Profit Shares:**\n\n* **Alex:** 43.10% of $80,000 = $34,480\n* **Blake:** 25.29% of $80,000 = $20,232\n* **Chloe:** 31.61% of $80,000 = $25,288 \n\n**Therefore, Chloe's share of the profit is $25,288.**",

Alex contributed $60,000 in initial capital, while Blair brought in $40,000. Their partnership agreement stipulated that they would share profits and losses in the ratio of their initial capital contributions.  To support their living expenses, the partners agreed to a drawing plan with an interest rate of 5% per annum on drawings: \n\n* **Alex:** Withdraws $1,000 at the beginning of each month.\n* **Blair:** Makes a single withdrawal of $12,000 sometime during the year. \n\nAt the end of the year, after deducting the interest on drawings from the total profit, the remaining profit available for distribution is $33,900.  What was the total profit for the year before the interest on drawings was deducted?",
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "## Reasoning:\nThis question is tricky because it combines regular and irregular drawings with a two-step calculation.  We need to determine the interest charged on both partners' drawings, work backwards from the final distributable profit to find the total profit before interest deduction. Here's the step-by-step solution: \n\n**1. Calculate Alex's Interest on Drawings:**\n* Alex withdraws $1,000 at the beginning of each month, totaling $1,000 * 12 = $12,000 for the year. \n* Since he withdraws at the beginning of each month, we can assume his money was used for the entire year. \n* Interest on Alex's drawings = $12,000 * 5/100 = $600\n\n**2.  Calculate Blair's Interest on Drawings:**\n* Blair withdraws $12,000 once, but we don't know the exact date.\n* To calculate the maximum possible interest, let's assume Blair withdrew the money at the beginning of the year. \n* Interest on Blair's drawings (maximum) = $12,000 * 5/100 = $600 \n\n**3. Calculate Total Interest on Drawings:**\n* Total interest on drawings = $600 (Alex) + $600 (Blair) = $1,200\n\n**4. Calculate Total Profit Before Interest Deduction:**\n* We know the profit after interest deduction is $33,900\n* Total profit = Profit after interest deduction + Total interest on drawings\n* Total profit = $33,900 + $1,200 = $35,100\n\nTherefore, the partnership's total profit for the year before deducting the interest on drawings was $35,100.  It's important to note that this calculation assumes Blair made her withdrawal at the beginning of the year. If she withdrew the funds later in the year, the total interest on drawings, and therefore the total profit, would be slightly lower.",
