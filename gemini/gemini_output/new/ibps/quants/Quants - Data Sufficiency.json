Similarly, in triangle DEF, angle DEF = angle DFE = 'y'.\n\n   * **Angle Sum Property:** The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Applying this to triangle ABC:  x + x + 40 = 180.

Find Possible Locations for Point C:**\n   - Since Point C lies on the line y = 2x - 3, we can represent its coordinates as (x, 2x - 3).\n\n**3. Use the Distance Formula:**\n   - Calculate the distance between A and B:  \u221a[(4 - (-2))^2 + (7 - 1)^2] = \u221a72 = 6\u221a2\n   - Calculate the distance between A and C: \u221a[(x - (-2))^2 + ((2x - 3) - 1)^2] = \u221a(5x^2 - 16x + 20)\n   - Calculate the distance between B and C: \u221a[(x - 4)^2 + ((2x - 3) - 7)^2] = \u221a(5x^2 - 36x + 100) \n\n**4. Determine the Shortest Side:**\n   - To minimize calculations, observe that the distance formula involves squaring the differences in x and y coordinates. Since the coefficient of the x^2 term is the same (5) in the distances AC and BC, we only need to compare the constant terms under the radical to get a sense of the shortest distance. \n   - Notice that the constant term in the distance BC (100) is much larger than the constant term in the distance AC (20). This suggests that AC is likely to be shorter than BC. \n\n**5. Minimize AC (if necessary):** \n   - To confirm AC is indeed the shortest, we can optionally complete the square or use calculus to minimize the expression for the distance AC (\u221a(5x^2 - 16x + 20)). However, for the purpose of this problem, the comparison of constant terms is sufficient.\n\n**6. Find the Midpoint of AC:**\n   - Since we don't need the exact coordinates of C, we can find the midpoint of AC directly.  Let the midpoint be (M, N). \n   - M = (-2 + x) / 2  \n   - N = (1 + (2x - 3)) / 2 = (2x - 2) / 2 = x - 1\n\n**7.

Calculate the work rate of one artisan:**\n\n* If the original team completes the work in 12 days, their combined work rate is 1/12 of the work per day.\n\n**2. Calculate the reduced efficiency:**\n\n* A 20% reduction in efficiency means they work at 80% of their individual rate. This is equivalent to 0.8 times their original efficiency.\n\n**3. Calculate the team's combined work rate with reduced efficiency:**\n\n* Let 'x' be the number of artisans on the original team. Their combined work rate with reduced efficiency is (0.8 * x)/12 of the work per day.\n\n**4.  Set up an equation to find the total number of artisans needed:**\n\n* Let 'y' be the number of additional artisans needed.\n* The total work rate with the additional artisans should be enough to complete the job in 10 days, meaning their combined work rate is 1/10 of the work per day.\n* The equation becomes:  (0.8x)/12 + (y/12) = 1/10\n\n**5. Simplify and solve for 'y':\n\n* Multiply both sides of the equation by 60 (the least common multiple of 12 and 10) to get rid of the fractions: 4x + 5y = 6\n* We need to find the value of 'y' (additional artisans) required to complete the work in 10 days. \n* Since we don't know the exact value of 'x' (the original number of artisans), we need to find a value for 'y' that satisfies the equation and represents a whole number of artisans.\n* Trying different values, if we assume x = 5 (the original team had 5 artisans), the equation becomes: 20 + 5y = 6\n* Solving for 'y', we get y = -2.8\n* Since we can't have a negative number of artisans, our assumption of x = 5 was incorrect. \n* Let's try x = 10 (the original team had 10 artisans). The equation becomes: 40 + 5y = 6\n* Solving for 'y', we get y = -6.8\n* Again, we can't have negative artisans. \n* Let's try x = 15 (original team had 15 artisans). The equation becomes: 60 + 5y = 6\n* Solving for 'y', we get y = -10.8\n* We still can't have negative artisans.  \n*  Notice that as we increase 'x', the value of 'y' becomes more negative. This indicates that we need to decrease 'x' to get a positive value for 'y'.  Let's try x = 1 (the original team had 1 artisan). The equation becomes: 4 + 5y = 6\n* Solving for 'y', we get y = 0.4 \n*  Since we need whole artisans, this means we need to add **1** artisan to the original team (rounding 0.4 up to 1) to compensate for the reduced efficiency and meet the deadline.\n\n**Therefore, 1 additional artisan needs to be added to complete the collection in 10 days.**",
