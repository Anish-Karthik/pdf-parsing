            "reasoning": "This question utilizes the triangle inequality theorem. This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nLet's denote the unknown side length as 'x'.  We need to consider the following inequalities to find the smallest possible whole number value for 'x':\n\n*  7 + 11 > x\n*  7 + x > 11\n*  11 + x > 7\n\nSolving the second inequality, we get x > 4. Therefore, the smallest possible whole number greater than 4 is 5. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible whole number length for the third side of the triangle is 5 cm.",

Find the side length of the cube:**\n\n* We know the volume of a cube is calculated by side * side * side (or side cubed).\n* Since the volume of the box is 125 cubic inches, we find the cube root of 125, which is 5. This means each side of the box is 5 inches long.\n\n**2. Relate the side length to the diameter of the basketball:**\n\n* The basketball touches all sides of the box, meaning the diameter of the basketball is equal to the side length of the box.\n* Therefore, the diameter of the basketball is 5 inches.\n\n**3.

            "reasoning": "**1. Visualize the Problem:**\n\n   Imagine a regular hexagon perfectly fitting inside a circle.  The center of the circle is also the center of the hexagon. We're interested in the vectors going from the center to a vertex (\\vec{u}) and from that vertex to the next vertex (\\vec{v}).\n\n**2. Use Geometry:**\n\n   * **Angles:** A regular hexagon has six equal central angles, each measuring 360\u00b0/6 = 60\u00b0. Since \\vec{u} goes from the center to a vertex and \\vec{v} goes from that vertex to the next, the angle between \\vec{u} and \\vec{v} is 60\u00b0.\n   * **Magnitudes:** Both \\vec{u} and \\vec{v} are radii of the circle, so their magnitudes are both 1.\n\n**3. Apply the Dot Product Formula:**\n\n   The dot product of two vectors is related to the cosine of the angle between them:\n\n   \\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v} = |\\vec{u}| |\\vec{v}| cos(\u03b8)\n\n   where \u03b8 is the angle between \\vec{u} and \\vec{v}.\n\n**4. Calculate:**\n\n   Substitute the known values:\n\n   \\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v} = (1)(1)cos(60\u00b0) = (1)(1)(1/2) = 1/2\n\n**Therefore, the dot product \\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v} is 1/2.**",
