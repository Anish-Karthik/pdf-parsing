To solve it, we need to determine the individual work rates of Olivia and Ethan, and then combine those rates to find their combined work time.\n\n**1. Olivia's Work Rate:**\n\n* Olivia paints 2/5 of the fence in 6 hours. \n* To find how long it takes her to paint the entire fence, we set up a proportion:\n   (2/5 fence) / 6 hours = (1 fence) / x hours\n* Solving for x, we cross-multiply: 2/5 * x = 6\n* Therefore, x = (6 * 5) / 2 = 15 hours. Olivia takes 15 hours to paint the entire fence.\n* Her work rate is 1/15 of the fence per hour. \n\n**2. Ethan's Work Rate:**\n\n* Ethan paints 1/3 of the fence in 5 hours.\n* Using a similar proportion: (1/3 fence) / 5 hours = (1 fence) / y hours\n* Cross-multiplying: 1/3 * y = 5\n* Solving for y: y = 5 * 3 = 15 hours. Ethan also takes 15 hours to paint the entire fence.\n* His work rate is 1/15 of the fence per hour.\n\n**3. Combined Work Rate:**\n\n* To find their combined work rate, we add their individual rates: 1/15 + 1/15 = 2/15 of the fence per hour.\n\n**4. Time to Complete Together:**\n\n* Let 't' be the time they take to complete the job together.\n* (2/15 fence/hour) * t hours = 1 fence \n* Solving for 't': t = 1 / (2/15) = 7.5 hours\n\n**Therefore, it will take Olivia and Ethan 7.5 hours to paint the entire fence together.**",
