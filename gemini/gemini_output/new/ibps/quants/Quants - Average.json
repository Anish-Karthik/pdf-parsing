It requires calculating the 10-day moving average for day 12 and then comparing it to the day 12 price. Here's how to solve it:\n\n**1. Calculate the 10-day moving average for day 12:**\n   - Sum the closing prices from day 3 to day 12: 15.50 + 15.45 + 15.60 + 15.75 + 15.80 + 15.90 + 16.00 + 15.95 + 16.10 + 16.05 = 158.10\n   - Divide the sum by 10: 158.10 / 10 = 15.81\n\n**2. Compare the 10-day MA to the day 12 price:**\n   - The 10-day MA is 15.81, and the day 12 closing price is 16.05.\n   - Since the day 12 price is *above* the moving average, the strategy would likely signal a 'buy' for day 13.\n\n**Therefore, the hedge fund would likely consider buying the stock on day 13.**\n",

            "reasoning": "This question is designed to be tricky because it involves a two-part journey where the simple average speed is incorrect. Here's why and how to solve it:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\n* **Outbound Trip:** The swimmer fights against the current. Their actual speed is less than what it seems because the current slows them down.\n* **Return Trip:** The swimmer is aided by the current. Their actual speed is faster than it seems because the current pushes them along.\n\n**Why Harmonic Mean?**\n\nThe harmonic mean is used to find the average of rates.  In this case, the 'rates' are the speeds over equal distances.  \n\n**Solution**\n\n1. **Calculate the swimmer's speed in still water:**\n   * Since it takes 50 seconds to cover 200 meters, the swimmer's speed across the river (perpendicular to the current) is 200 meters / 50 seconds = 4 m/s.\n\n2. **Calculate the swimmer's speed against the current (outbound):**\n   * Let the swimmer's speed against the current be 'x' m/s. \n   * Using the Pythagorean theorem (considering the speeds as vectors): x\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 => x = \u221a20 m/s\n\n3. **Calculate the swimmer's speed with the current (return):**\n   * Let the swimmer's speed with the current be 'y' m/s. \n   * Using the Pythagorean theorem: y\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 => y = \u221a20 m/s \n\n4. **Calculate the average speed using the harmonic mean:**\n   * Average speed = 2 / [(1/\u221a20) + (1/\u221a20)] \n   * Average speed = 2\u221a20 / 2 = \u221a20 \u2248 4.47 m/s \n\n**Therefore, the swimmer's average speed over the entire journey is approximately 4.47 m/s.**",

            "reasoning": "Let's break down this problem step-by-step:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts**\n\n* **Arithmetic Series:**  A sequence of consecutive multiples of a number forms an arithmetic series (the difference between consecutive terms is constant).\n* **Average of an Arithmetic Series:** The average of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term.  It's also equal to the middle term if there are an odd number of terms.\n\n**Solving the Problem**\n\n1. **The Middle Number:**  Since we have 21 consecutive multiples of 7, the middle number (the 11th number) is the average of the entire sequence.  Let's call this middle number 'M'.\n\n2. **Average after First Erasure:** After erasing 'M', we have 20 numbers.  The sum of these 20 numbers has decreased by 'M'.  Since the average is the sum divided by the number of terms, the new average is (Sum - M)/20.\n\n3. **Second Erasure's Impact:** Erasing another number reduces the sum and changes the average. The problem states that the average drops by 3.  Let the last erased number be 'X'.  This means:\n\n    (Sum - M - X)/19  = (Sum - M)/20 - 3\n\n4. **Simplifying and Solving for X:**\n    * Multiply both sides of the equation by 19*20 to get rid of the denominators.\n    * Expand and simplify the equation.\n    * You'll eventually arrive at an equation where you can solve for X in terms of M.\n\n5. **Relationship between X and M:** You'll find that X = M - 114.  This means the last number erased is 114 less than the original middle number.\n\n6. **Finding the Last Number:** Since the sequence consists of multiples of 7, and the middle number 'M' is a multiple of 7, the last number erased (X) must also be a multiple of 7.  The only multiple of 7 that is 114 less than another multiple of 7 is **-105** (because -105 + 114 = 9, which is a multiple of 7).\n\n**Therefore, the value of the last number erased is -105.**",

Here's how to solve it:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts**\n\n* **Geometric Sequence:** A sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor, called the common ratio.\n* **Geometric Mean:** The central tendency of a set of numbers in a geometric sequence. For a sequence with 'n' terms, the geometric mean is the nth root of the product of all the terms.\n\n**Solution**\n\n1. **Finding the Common Ratio:** Since the returns follow a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive years' returns is constant. We can find this common ratio (r) using the information about the 3rd and 5th-year returns:\n\n    * 3rd year return: a*r^2 = 0.05  (where 'a' is the first-year return)\n    * 5th year return: a*r^4 = 0.10\n\n    * Dividing the second equation by the first: (a*r^4) / (a*r^2) = 0.10 / 0.05\n    * Simplifying: r^2 = 2\n    * Therefore: r = sqrt(2)\n\n2. **Geometric Mean without All Terms:** The beauty of the geometric mean is that we don't need all the terms in a geometric sequence to calculate it if we know the common ratio and the number of terms. The geometric mean in this case is:\n\n    * GM = (a * a*r * a*r^2 * a*r^3 * a*r^4 * a*r^5)^(1/6)\n    * This simplifies to: GM = a*r^2.5  \n\n3. **Utilizing Known Information:** We know a*r^2 = 0.05 (from the 3rd-year return).
