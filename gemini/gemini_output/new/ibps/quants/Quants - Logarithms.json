They observe that the number of bacteria in the culture, denoted by N(t), after t hours, can be modeled by the equation N(t) = 500 * e^(kt), where k is a constant.  To analyze the growth further, the researchers define a new function, L(t), which represents the logarithm (base 10) of the number of bacteria present at time t.  What is the relationship between the growth rate 'k' of the bacteria culture and the slope of the graph of L(t) as a function of t?",

            "reasoning": "This question dives into the connection between exponential growth and logarithmic functions, requiring a solid understanding of derivatives and logarithmic properties. Here's how we solve it:\n\n1. **Understanding L(t):**  We're given that L(t) is the base-10 logarithm of N(t): \n   L(t) = log\u2081\u2080(N(t)) = log\u2081\u2080(500 * e^(kt))\n\n2. **Applying Logarithmic Properties:** Using the properties of logarithms, we can simplify this expression:\n   L(t) = log\u2081\u2080(500) + log\u2081\u2080(e^(kt))\n   L(t) = log\u2081\u2080(500) + kt * log\u2081\u2080(e) \n\n3. **Finding the Slope:** The slope of L(t) as a function of t is its derivative with respect to t: \n   dL(t)/dt = d/dt [log\u2081\u2080(500) + kt * log\u2081\u2080(e)]\n   Since log\u2081\u2080(500) and log\u2081\u2080(e) are constants, their derivatives are zero: \n   dL(t)/dt = k * log\u2081\u2080(e)\n\n4. **The Relationship:** The slope of the graph of L(t) is equal to the growth rate 'k' multiplied by the constant log\u2081\u2080(e).\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the growth rate 'k' and the slope of the graph of L(t) is that the **slope is directly proportional to the growth rate**, with the constant of proportionality being **log\u2081\u2080(e)**.",

It's designed as 'tricky 8/10' due to the multi-step process involved:\n\n1. **Finding the decay constant (k):**  We first need to use the given information (initial mass, mass after 5 years) to solve for the decay constant 'k' in the equation.\n2. **Setting up the equation for 25 grams:**  Next, we need to plug in 25 grams for the remaining mass (M) and solve the equation for time (t).\n3. **Using Logarithms:** This step requires applying the natural logarithm to both sides of the equation to isolate 't'.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n**Step 1: Finding k**\n\n* We know M<sub>0</sub> = 100 grams, M = 75 grams, and t = 5 years.\n* Substitute these values into the equation: 75 = 100e<sup>5k</sup>\n* Divide both sides by 100: 0.75 = e<sup>5k</sup>\n* Take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.75) = ln(e<sup>5k</sup>)\n* Use the property ln(e<sup>x</sup>) = x: ln(0.75) = 5k\n* Solve for k: k = ln(0.75) / 5 \u2248 -0.0575\n\n**Step 2: Solving for time (t) when M = 25 grams**\n\n* Substitute M = 25 grams and the calculated k value into the equation: 25 = 100e<sup>-0.0575t</sup>\n* Divide both sides by 100: 0.25 = e<sup>-0.0575t</sup>\n* Take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.25) = ln(e<sup>-0.0575t</sup>)\n* Use the property ln(e<sup>x</sup>) = x: ln(0.25) = -0.0575t\n* Solve for t: t = ln(0.25) / -0.0575 \u2248 24.09 years\n\n**Therefore, it will take approximately 24.09 years for the remaining mass of the isotope to reach 25 grams.**",
