Here's why the solution involves the steps mentioned:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find a path, represented by a function y=f(x), that minimizes the travel time of a particle under gravity. This is an optimization problem involving a function, fitting the scope of Calculus of Variations.\n\n2. **Setting up the Functional:**  The time taken is given by the integral of (ds/v). We can express ds using the Pythagorean theorem: ds = sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)\u00b2)dx = sqrt(1 + (f'(x))\u00b2)dx.  From conservation of energy, we can relate the speed 'v' to the height 'y'. Assuming the particle starts from rest, we have (1/2)mv\u00b2 = mgy, which gives us v = sqrt(2gy) = sqrt(2gf(x)).  \n\n3. **Applying Euler-Lagrange Equation:** The time taken is now an integral dependent on f(x) and f'(x).  This is our functional. To minimize this functional, we employ the Euler-Lagrange equation.  Solving this differential equation will give us the function f(x) that minimizes the travel time.\n\n4. **Boundary Conditions:** The constraints f(0)=0 and f(1)=1 are crucial in determining the specific solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation and finding the unique minimizing path.\n\nTherefore, the problem clearly utilizes core concepts of Calculus of Variations, making it a suitable question for testing understanding in this area.  While it involves physics, the emphasis is on applying the mathematical tools of Calculus of Variations to a concrete scenario.  The level is 'easy' as it involves a standard formulation and does not require advanced manipulation or techniques beyond the basic Euler-Lagrange approach.",

Since we only have discrete data points for displacement at certain times, we cannot directly compute the derivative using calculus. Instead, we use a numerical method to approximate the derivative from the given data.\n\n**Choosing the Central Difference Method**\n\nThe central difference method is a suitable choice for this problem because it provides a more accurate approximation of the derivative compared to the forward or backward difference methods, especially when the data points are evenly spaced.\n\n**Applying the Central Difference Formula**\n\nThe central difference formula for approximating the first derivative is given by:\n\n```\nf'(x) \u2248 [f(x + h) - f(x - h)] / 2h\n```\n\nWhere:\n* f'(x) is the approximate derivative of f at x\n* f(x + h) is the function value at a small step h ahead of x\n* f(x - h) is the function value at a small step h behind x\n* h is the step size\n\nIn our case:\n* x = 1.5 (the time at which we want to estimate the velocity)\n* h = 0.5 (the time interval between data points)\n* f(x + h) = 4.2 (displacement at t = 2.0)\n* f(x - h) = 2.5 (displacement at t = 1.0)\n\n**Calculating the Velocity**\n\nPlugging these values into the central difference formula, we get:\n\n```\nv(1.5) \u2248 [4.2 - 2.5] / (2 * 0.5)\n     \u2248 1.7 / 1\n     \u2248 1.7 cm/s\n```\n\nTherefore, the approximate velocity of the pendulum bob at t = 1.5 seconds is 1.7 cm/s.",

Therefore, the rate of change of the volume of water is given by:\n\ndV/dt = 4\u03c0(dV/dt)\n\nWe are given that dV/dt is proportional to the square root of the volume of water already in the tank, so we can write:\n\ndV/dt = k\u221aV\n\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality.  We are also given that dV/dt = 0.5 when the tank is half full. The volume of the full tank is \u03c0(2)^2h = 4\u03c0h, where h is the height of the tank. Thus, when the tank is half full, V = 2\u03c0h. We can use this information to solve for k:\n\n0.5 = k\u221a(2\u03c0h)\n\nk = 0.5/\u221a(2\u03c0h)\n\nSubstituting this value of k back into the differential equation, we get:\n\ndV/dt = (0.5/\u221a(2\u03c0h))\u221aV\n\nThis is a separable differential equation.

Using the initial condition V(0) = 0, we find that C = 0.  Therefore, we have:\n\n2\u221aV = (0.5/\u221a(2\u03c0h))t\n\nSolving for V, we get:\n\nV = (1/16\u03c0h)t^2\n\nTo find the volume of water in the tank after 1 hour (60 minutes), we substitute t = 60 into this equation:\n\nV(60) = (1/16\u03c0h)(60)^2 = 225/\u03c0h\n\nTherefore, the volume of water in the tank after 1 hour is 225/\u03c0h cubic meters.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 225\u03c0h \nB) 225/\u03c0h\nC) 225h\nD) 225/h\n\nCorrect Option: B) 225/\u03c0h",

Finding an analytical solution, which would involve obtaining an explicit formula for the comet's position as a function of time, is highly challenging for the following reasons:\n\n* **Non-linearity:** The gravitational forces involved are nonlinear functions of the comet's position, making the differential equation highly nonlinear.\n* **Coupling:** The x and y components of the comet's motion are coupled through the distance terms in the denominators, adding further complexity.\n* **No Closed-Form Solution:** Three-body problems, even in their simplest forms, generally do not possess closed-form solutions in terms of elementary functions.\n\n**(b)** A suitable numerical method for this second-order differential equation is the **Velocity Verlet** method. It offers a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency and is particularly well-suited for problems involving forces dependent only on position. Here's how to implement it:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n    * Define the initial conditions: the comet's initial position (x_0, y_0) and initial velocity (v_x0, v_y0).\n    * Set the values for G_1, G_2, M_1, M_2, (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), and the simulation time step (\u0394t).\n\n2. **Iteration:**\n    * For each time step from t = 0 to t = T, perform the following calculations:\n        * **Calculate the acceleration:**\n            * a_x(t) = -G_1*M_1*(x(t) - x_1)/(((x(t) - x_1)^2 + (y(t) - y_1)^2)^(3/2)) - G_2*M_2*(x(t) - x_2)/(((x(t) - x_2)^2 + (y(t) - y_2)^2)^(3/2))\n            * a_y(t) = -G_1*M_1*(y(t) - y_1)/(((x(t) - x_1)^2 + (y(t) - y_1)^2)^(3/2)) - G_2*M_2*(y(t) - y_2)/(((x(t) - x_2)^2 + (y(t) - y_2)^2)^(3/2))\n        * **Update the position:**\n            * x(t + \u0394t) = x(t) + v_x(t)*\u0394t + 0.5*a_x(t)*\u0394t^2\n            * y(t + \u0394t) = y(t) + v_y(t)*\u0394t + 0.5*a_y(t)*\u0394t^2\n        * **Calculate the new acceleration:**\n            * a_x(t + \u0394t) = -G_1*M_1*(x(t + \u0394t) - x_1)/(((x(t + \u0394t) - x_1)^2 + (y(t + \u0394t) - y_1)^2)^(3/2)) - G_2*M_2*(x(t + \u0394t) - x_2)/(((x(t + \u0394t) - x_2)^2 + (y(t + \u0394t) - y_2)^2)^(3/2))\n            * a_y(t + \u0394t) = -G_1*M_1*(y(t + \u0394t) - y_1)/(((x(t + \u0394t) - x_1)^2 + (y(t + \u0394t) - y_1)^2)^(3/2)) - G_2*M_2*(y(t + \u0394t) - y_2)/(((x(t + \u0394t) - x_2)^2 + (y(t + \u0394t) - y_2)^2)^(3/2))\n        * **Update the velocity:**\n            * v_x(t + \u0394t) = v_x(t) + 0.5*(a_x(t) + a_x(t + \u0394t))*\u0394t\n            * v_y(t + \u0394t) = v_y(t) + 0.5*(a_y(t) + a_y(t + \u0394t))*\u0394t\n\n3. **Output:** After completing the iterations, the values x(T) and y(T) represent the comet's predicted position at time T. \n\n**(c) Step Size Considerations:**\n\n* **Accuracy:** A smaller time step (\u0394t) generally leads to higher accuracy.  This is because a smaller step size better approximates the continuous nature of the comet's motion. Larger steps introduce errors as the calculation assumes constant acceleration over the duration of the step, which might not be accurate, especially in regions with rapidly changing gravitational forces.\n* **Computational Cost:** Smaller time steps increase the number of iterations required to reach the final time T, directly increasing computational cost. A good balance between accuracy and efficiency is essential.\n\nIn practice, one can start with a reasonable step size and then perform convergence analysis by successively decreasing the step size and observing the changes in the solution. If the changes become insignificant below a certain step size, that value can be considered a suitable compromise between accuracy and cost.",
