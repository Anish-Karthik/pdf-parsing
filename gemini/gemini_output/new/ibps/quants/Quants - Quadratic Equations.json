This involves recognizing the vertical stretch by a factor of -5 (leading to reflection across the x-axis) and a vertical shift upwards by 0 units. \n\n**2. Vertex Interpretation:**\n* The question requires finding the vertex of the parabola, which represents the maximum height of the firework and the time it takes to reach it.

Finding the Vertex:**\n   *  The vertex of the parabola represents the maximum point.

The solutions of this equation represent the points where the parabola intersects the x-axis.  We need to find the values of 'k' for which there are 7 integers between these roots.\n\n3. **Visualizing:** Imagine the parabola. Since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is negative, it opens downwards. For the inequality to hold true for exactly 7 integer values, the parabola needs to intersect the x-axis at points such that there are 7 integers between the points of intersection. \n\n4. **Factoring and Integer Solutions:** The key is to realize that for the quadratic to have integer solutions, its discriminant must be a perfect square. The discriminant (\u0394) is given by:\n\n   \u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac = 5\u00b2 - 4(-2)(k-3) = 25 + 8k - 24 = 8k + 1 \n\n   We need to find values of 'k' such that 8k + 1 is a perfect square and the parabola encloses 7 integers.\n\n5. **Testing Values:**  We start testing integer values of 'k' to find suitable values that result in a perfect square for the discriminant and satisfy the 7 integer solution criteria:\n\n   - For 'k' = 1, \u0394 = 9 (perfect square), but the parabola won't enclose 7 integers\n   - Continue testing values of 'k' systematically (k = 3, k = 6, etc.)\n\n6. **Solution:** Through trial and error, we discover that when k = 10, the discriminant \u0394 = 81, which is a perfect square.

The integers -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 satisfy the inequality, giving us exactly 7 integer solutions.\n\n   Therefore, the only integer value of 'k' that satisfies the given conditions is k = 10. \n",

            "reasoning": "This question falls under the 'Quadratic Functions: Domain, Range, and Transformations' topic as it involves analyzing a quadratic function representing a parabolic trajectory. It requires understanding transformations (shifting, stretching) and their impact on the function's range. \n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify Transformations:** The function h(t) = -2(t - 3)^2 + 100 is a transformation of the basic quadratic function f(t) = t^2.\n    * -2 coefficient: Reflects the parabola across the x-axis and stretches it vertically by a factor of 2.\n    * (t - 3): Shifts the parabola 3 units to the right.\n    * +100: Shifts the parabola 100 units up.\n\n2. **Visualize the Parabola:**  Imagine a basic parabola. The transformations indicate it's flipped, stretched vertically, and shifted right and up.\n\n3. **Find Time Intervals for Visible Height:** We need to find when the height, h(t), is between 50 and 90 pixels.\n    * **Lower Bound (50 pixels):** Solve the equation -2(t - 3)^2 + 100 = 50 \n       *  -2(t - 3)^2 = -50\n       *  (t - 3)^2 = 25\n       *  t - 3 = \u00b15 \n       *  t = 8 or t = -2 (We discard t = -2 as time cannot be negative.)\n    * **Upper Bound (90 pixels):** Solve -2(t - 3)^2 + 100 = 90\n       * -2(t - 3)^2 = -10\n       * (t - 3)^2 = 5\n       * t - 3 = \u00b1\u221a5\n       * t = 3 + \u221a5  or t = 3 - \u221a5\n\n4. **Time Interval:** Combining the solutions, the firework is visible between t = 3 - \u221a5 seconds and t = 3 + \u221a5 seconds, and also between t = 8 seconds and the time it takes to reach the ground after the second crossing of 90 pixels. Since the question asks for the interval where it's visible between 50 and 90 pixels, the final answer is **3 - \u221a5  \u2264 t \u2264 3 + \u221a5**\n\nThis question is challenging due to the required understanding of transformations, solving quadratic inequalities, and interpreting the results within the context of the problem.",

            "reasoning": "## Reasoning: \n\nThis question combines several challenging aspects to thoroughly test the understanding of completing the square:\n\n1. **Decimal Coefficients:** The presence of -2.5 as the leading coefficient increases the complexity of the calculations. \n2. **Contextual Application:** The problem is embedded in a financial scenario requiring the student to understand the meaning of zero profit and its relationship to the quadratic equation.\n3. **Non-Standard Form:** The equation needs to be rearranged first, which adds an extra step.\n4. **Solution Involving k:**  The solution is not a numerical value but an expression involving the constant k, testing the student's ability to work with parameters.\n5. **Specific Form Requirement:** The answer needs to be expressed in a specific radical form, further assessing algebraic manipulation skills.\n\n## Solution:\n\n**Step 1: Set P to zero and rearrange the equation:**\nSince we're looking for the values of P where the profit is zero, we substitute P = 0: \n-2.5(0)\u00b2 + 15(0) - 17.5 = -k \nThis simplifies to -17.5 = -k, or k = 17.5 \nNow, substitute this value of k back into the original equation and set P to zero to solve for the values of P that give zero profit:\n-2.5P\u00b2 + 15P - 17.5 = -17.5\nSimplifying, we get:\n-2.5P\u00b2 + 15P = 0\n\n**Step 2:  Divide by the leading coefficient:**\nTo complete the square, we need the coefficient of the P\u00b2 term to be 1. Divide both sides of the equation by -2.5:\nP\u00b2 - 6P = 0\n\n**Step 3:  Complete the square:**\nTake half of the coefficient of the P term (-6), square it ((-6/2)\u00b2 = 9), and add it to both sides of the equation:\nP\u00b2 - 6P + 9 = 0 + 9\n\n**Step 4: Factor the left side and simplify the right side:**\nThe left side now forms a perfect square trinomial: \n(P - 3)\u00b2 = 9\n\n**Step 5:  Solve for P:**\nTake the square root of both sides:\nP - 3 = \u00b1\u221a9\nP - 3 = \u00b13\n\n**Step 6: Isolate P:**\nP = 3 \u00b1 3\n\n**Therefore, the values of P that would result in a profit of zero are P = 0 and P = 6.**\n\n**Expressing the answer in the required form a \u00b1 b\u221a(ck + d), although not directly applicable here since we get integer solutions, would involve recognizing that 9 can be expressed as \u221a(9 * 1) = 3\u221a(1 * 17.5 - 16.5). This gives us:**\n\nP = 3 \u00b1 3\u221a(1 * 17.5 - 16.5) \n\nThis elaborate form, while not strictly necessary for the specific solutions, reinforces the understanding of the required format and demonstrates how the solution could be expressed with the constant k if it were part of the radical.",
