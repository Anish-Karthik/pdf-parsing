Calculate the maximum mass of NaCl:**\n   - The balance has a precision of \u00b10.01 g, meaning the actual mass could be as high as 2.54 g + 0.01 g = 2.55 g\n\n**2. Calculate the minimum volume of the solution:**\n   - The volumetric flask has a tolerance of \u00b10.5 mL, so the minimum volume could be 500.0 mL - 0.5 mL = 499.5 mL. Convert this to liters: 499.5 mL / 1000 mL/L = 0.4995 L \n\n**3. Calculate the maximum concentration:**\n   - Concentration (g/L) = Mass (g) / Volume (L)\n   - Maximum concentration = 2.55 g / 0.4995 L = 5.1051 g/L\n\n**4. Apply significant figures:**\n   - The mass measurement (2.55 g) has three significant figures.\n   - The volume measurement (0.4995 L) has four significant figures. \n   - When dividing, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest. Therefore, the final answer should have three significant figures.\n\n**5.

            "reasoning": "Let 'x' be the length of each plank and 'y' be the total length to cover.  \n\nFrom the problem, we can set up two equations:\n\n**Equation 1:**  y = 14x + 13 * 5  (14 planks and 13 spaces of 5cm each)\n**Equation 2:**  y = 10x + 9 * 7   (10 planks and 9 spaces of 7cm each)\n\nSince 'y' represents the same total length in both equations, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n14x + 65 = 10x + 63\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n4x = -2\n\nx = -0.5\n\nA negative length for a plank is not physically possible. This indicates an error in our initial assumption.  The error lies in assuming the number of spaces is one less than the number of planks.  The number of spaces *could* be one less, but the problem doesn't explicitly state that the fence *starts and ends* with a plank.  \n\nLet's revise our equations to account for a potential extra space at the beginning or end:\n\n**Equation 1:** y = 14x + 5n  (where 'n' is the number of spaces)\n**Equation 2:** y = 10x + 7n\n\nWe know from the problem that the difference in the number of spaces between the two scenarios is 4 (13 spaces - 9 spaces = 4 spaces).  Therefore, the difference in length due to the spaces alone must be 28cm (4 spaces * 7cm/space = 28cm).\n\nThis 28cm difference corresponds to the difference in length covered by the planks in the two scenarios (14x - 10x = 4x).  Therefore:\n\n4x = 28cm\nx = 7cm (The length of each plank)\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of 'x' back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find 'y'.
