            "difficulty": "easy",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts**\n\n* **Relative Speed:** The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes (6 degrees per minute), and the hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours (0.5 degrees per minute). Therefore, the minute hand gains 5.5 degrees on the hour hand every minute.\n* **Target Separation:** We want the minute hand to be 15 minutes ahead, which translates to an angular separation of 15 minutes * 6 degrees/minute = 90 degrees.\n\n**Calculations**\n\n1. **Initial Separation:** At 4:00, the hour hand is at the number 4, and the minute hand is at the number 12. This represents an angular separation of 4 hours * 30 degrees/hour = 120 degrees.\n\n2. **Degrees to Gain:** To be 15 minutes ahead, the minute hand needs to gain another 90 degrees - 120 degrees = -30 degrees (meaning it needs to close the gap by 30 degrees).\n\n3. **Time Taken:** Since the minute hand gains 5.5 degrees every minute, it will take -30 degrees / 5.5 degrees/minute = -5.45 minutes (approximately) to close the gap. The negative sign indicates moving backward in time.\n\n4. **Final Time:** Since we're moving backward from 4:00, the time when the minute hand is 15 minutes ahead is approximately 3:54:33 (4:00 minus 5 minutes and 27 seconds, which is the approximate equivalent of 5.45 minutes).\n\n**Therefore, the minute hand will be exactly 15 minutes ahead of the hour hand at approximately 3:54:33.**",

            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "Let's break down the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Upstream and Downstream:**\n\n* **Downstream:** When a boat travels in the same direction as the current, its speed is increased. The speed downstream is the boat's speed in still water plus the speed of the current.\n* **Upstream:** When a boat travels against the current, its speed is reduced. The speed upstream is the boat's speed in still water minus the speed of the current.\n\n**2.  Setting Up the Equations:**\n\n* Let 'x' be the speed of the boat in still water (km/h).\n* Let 'y' be the speed of the current (km/h).\n\n* Downstream speed = (x + y) km/h\n* Upstream speed = (x - y) km/h\n\n**3. Using the Formula:**\n\n* Speed = Distance / Time\n\n* From the problem, we know:\n    * Distance (downstream) = Distance (upstream) = 72 km\n    * Time (downstream) = 6 hours\n    * Time (upstream) = 10 hours\n\n* We can set up two equations:\n    * Equation 1 (Downstream): x + y = 72 km / 6 hours = 12 km/h\n    * Equation 2 (Upstream): x - y = 72 km / 10 hours = 7.2 km/h\n\n**4. Solving for the Speed of the Current (y):**\n\n* Notice that in the two equations, 'x' has opposite signs.  We can solve for 'y' by adding the two equations together:\n\n    (x + y) + (x - y) = 12 + 7.2\n    2x = 19.2\n    x = 9.6 km/h \n\n* Now that we know 'x', we can substitute it back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for 'y'. Let's use Equation 1:\n\n    9.6 + y = 12\n    y = 12 - 9.6\n    y = 2.4 km/h\n\n**Therefore, the speed of the current is 2.4 km/h.**",

Alice runs at a constant speed of 5 meters per second, while Bob starts at 6 meters per second but reduces his speed by 1% every time he completes a lap.  Who will win the race, and what will be the distance between them when the winner crosses the finish line?",
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n**1. Calculate Alice's time to finish the race:**\n\n* Time = Distance / Speed\n* Time = 1000 meters / 5 meters/second = 200 seconds\n\n**2. Calculate how many laps Bob needs to complete:**\n\n* Laps = Total Distance / Lap Distance\n* Laps = 1000 meters / 400 meters = 2.5 laps \n\nThis means Bob needs to complete 2 full laps and then another half lap to finish the race.\n\n**3. Calculate Bob's speed for each lap:**\n\n* Lap 1 Speed: 6 meters/second\n* Lap 2 Speed: 6 * (1 - 1/100) = 5.94 meters/second \n* Lap 3 Speed (for the remaining half): 5.94 * (1 - 1/100) = 5.88 meters per second (approx)\n\n**4. Calculate Bob's time for each lap:**\n\n* Lap 1 Time: 400 meters / 6 meters/second = 66.67 seconds (approx)\n* Lap 2 Time: 400 meters / 5.94 meters/second = 67.34 seconds (approx)\n* Lap 3 Time (for 200 meters): 200 meters / 5.88 meters/second = 34.01 seconds (approx)\n\n**5. Calculate Bob's total time:**\n\n* Total Time = Lap 1 Time + Lap 2 Time + Lap 3 Time\n* Total Time = 66.67 seconds + 67.34 seconds + 34.01 seconds = 168.02 seconds (approx)\n\n**6. Determine the winner:**\n\n* Alice finishes in 200 seconds, and Bob finishes in approximately 168.02 seconds. Therefore, Bob wins the race.\n\n**7. Calculate the distance between them when Bob finishes:**\n\n* Time difference between Bob and Alice: 200 seconds - 168.02 seconds = 31.98 seconds (approx)\n* Distance Alice covers in that time difference: 31.98 seconds * 5 meters/second = 159.9 meters (approx)\n\n**Answer:** Bob wins the race.

Determine the relative speeds of the truck and car when the truck begins its return journey:**\n\n* The car is traveling at 60 km/h and the truck is traveling at 40 km/h in the opposite direction. Their relative speed is 60 km/h + 40 km/h = 100 km/h.\n\n**5. Determine the distance between the car and truck when the truck starts heading back:**\n\n* The car traveled 165 km while the truck traveled 150 km.

Determine the Ratio of Speeds:**\n\n* The distance covered is directly proportional to their speeds since they run for the same time until their first meeting. \n* This implies the ratio of Alice's speed to Bob's speed is 150:250, which simplifies to 3:5.\n\n**3. Analyze the Second Meeting:**\n\n* For their second meeting, they will again collectively cover the entire track length of 400 meters.\n* Let's assume Alice covers '3x' meters for this meeting.

However, he is delayed and, knowing he must travel 50% faster to make it back on time, increases his car's speed accordingly. After traveling for 2 hours at this faster pace, he realizes he's forgotten a crucial item and must travel back to the fair again. To compensate for this detour, he decides to travel at his initial speed of 24 km/h for 150 minutes, then increase his speed by 25% for the rest of the return journey.

Subtract the time spent traveling at the increased speed (2 hours), the time spent traveling at the initial speed after returning to the fair (2.5 hours), and the initial travel time to the fair (which we'll call 'x') to find the remaining time: 8 hours - 2 hours - 2.5 hours - x hours = 3.5 hours - x hours\n\n**Step 7:  Set up an equation to represent the total distance traveled.**\n* Let 'x' represent the initial travel time to the fair.  The total distance is the sum of the distances of each leg of the journey: 24x + 72 + 60 + 30(3.5 - x)  \n\n**Step 8: Solve for 'x'.**\n* 24x + 72 + 60 + 105 - 30x = total distance\n* -6x + 237 = total distance\n* Since we know the total travel time is 8 hours and we've already accounted for 4.5 hours, the initial trip to the market took 8 hours - 4.5 hours = 3.5 hours.\n* Therefore, x = 3.5 hours\n\n**Step 9: Calculate the total distance.**\n* Substitute the value of 'x' back into the equation from Step 7:\n* -6(3.5) + 237 = total distance\n* -21 + 237 = 216 km\n\n**Therefore, the total distance the merchant traveled by car is 216 km.** ",

            "question": "A driver is traveling downhill on a mountain road with a 5% gradient.  The car is traveling at a speed of 72 km/h when the driver notices a stationary vehicle obstructing the road 100 meters ahead. The driver has a reaction time of 0.8 seconds.  Assuming the car's braking system can provide a maximum deceleration of 4 m/s\u00b2 and accounting for the influence of gravity on the car's braking distance, will the driver be able to stop before hitting the obstruction? If yes, what is the remaining distance to the obstacle?",
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to break down the solution to this problem:\n\n**1. Convert km/h to m/s:**\n\n* The car's speed is 72 km/h, which translates to 72 * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 20 m/s.\n\n**2. Calculate the distance traveled during the reaction time:**\n\n* Distance = Speed * Time\n* Distance = 20 m/s * 0.8 s = 16 meters\n\n**3. Calculate the component of gravity acting parallel to the road surface:**\n\n* The gradient of the road is 5%, which means that for every 100 meters traveled horizontally, the road descends 5 meters vertically. We can use trigonometry (sine function) to find the component of gravity acting parallel to the slope.\n* Gravity component (parallel) = 9.8 m/s\u00b2 * sin(arctan(0.05)) \u2248 0.49 m/s\u00b2 \n\n**4. Calculate the effective deceleration:**\n\n* Since the car is traveling downhill, gravity will reduce the effectiveness of the braking. \n* Effective Deceleration = Braking Deceleration - Gravity Component\n* Effective Deceleration = 4 m/s\u00b2 - 0.49 m/s\u00b2 = 3.51 m/s\u00b2\n\n**5. Calculate the braking distance:**\n\n* We can use the following equation of motion: final velocity\u00b2 = initial velocity\u00b2 + 2 * acceleration * distance\n* In this case, the final velocity is 0 m/s (car comes to a stop), initial velocity is 20 m/s, and acceleration is -3.51 m/s\u00b2 (negative since it's deceleration).\n* 0\u00b2 = 20\u00b2 + 2 * (-3.51) * distance\n* Distance = (20\u00b2)/(2*3.51) \u2248 57 meters\n\n**6. Calculate total stopping distance:**\n\n* Total Stopping Distance = Reaction Distance + Braking Distance\n* Total Stopping Distance = 16 m + 57 m = 73 meters\n\n**7. Determine if the car will stop before the obstacle:**\n\n* The driver notices the obstacle at 100 meters and the total stopping distance is 73 meters. \n* Remaining distance = 100 m - 73 m = 27 m\n\n**Final Answer:** Yes, the driver will be able to stop before hitting the obstruction. The remaining distance to the obstacle is 27 meters. ",
