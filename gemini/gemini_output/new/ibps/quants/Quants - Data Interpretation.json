Here's a breakdown:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:** \n\nA 'false buy' signal occurs when the stock price drops two standard deviations below the mean due to random fluctuations, not a genuine trend change. The question hinges on comparing the probabilities of this event under two different distributions: normal and Laplace. \n\n**2. Normal Distribution Calculation:**\n\n* We need to find the probability of a stock price being below $46 (50 - 2*2).  \n* This involves standardizing the value (z-score) and using a standard normal distribution table or calculator.\n\n**3. Laplace Distribution Calculation:**\n\n* This requires understanding the probability density function of the Laplace distribution and integrating it to find the probability of the price being below $46.\n\n**4. The 'Trick':**\n\n* The trick lies in the fact that the Laplace distribution has 'fatter tails'. This means extreme events, like a two-standard deviation drop, are more likely under the Laplace distribution than under the normal distribution, even if they share the same mean and standard deviation. \n\n**5. Ratio Calculation:**\n\n* Finally, we need to calculate the ratio of the probability calculated under the Laplace distribution to that under the normal distribution to quantify how much more likely a false buy signal is under the Laplace distribution. \n\n**Detailed Solution:**\n\nLet X be the random variable representing the stock price. \n\n* **Normal Distribution:**\n    * We want to find P(X < 46). Standardizing, we get P(Z < (46-50)/2) = P(Z < -2). \n    * Using a standard normal table, P(Z < -2) is approximately 0.0228.\n\n* **Laplace Distribution:**\n    * The probability density function of a Laplace distribution with mean \u03bc and scale parameter b is f(x) = (1/(2b)) * exp(-|x-\u03bc|/b).\n    * In this case, \u03bc = 50 and b = 2. \n    * We want to find P(X < 46) = \u222b from -\u221e to 46 of  (1/4) * exp(-|x-50|/2) dx. \n    * Solving this integral (which might require some calculus), we get a probability of approximately 0.0677.\n\n* **Ratio:**\n    * The ratio of probabilities is 0.0677 / 0.0228, which is approximately 2.97. \n\n**Therefore, the probability of a false buy signal is approximately 2.97 times higher under the Laplace distribution than under the normal distribution.**",

            "question": "A company experienced fluctuating sales figures over a three-year period. In 2020, their sales revenue was $500,000. The following year, sales increased by 15%, but unfortunately, in 2022, they experienced a decline of 8% compared to their 2021 sales.  The company aims to achieve a cumulative sales growth of 10% by the end of 2023, based on their 2020 figures. \n\n What percentage increase in sales will they need to achieve in 2023, relative to their 2022 sales, to reach their target?",
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "**1. Calculate 2021 sales:**\n* Increase in 2021: $500,000 * 0.15 = $75,000\n* Total sales in 2021: $500,000 + $75,000 = $575,000\n\n**2. Calculate 2022 sales:**\n* Decrease in 2022: $575,000 * 0.08 = $46,000\n* Total sales in 2022: $575,000 - $46,000 = $529,000\n\n**3. Calculate the target sales for 2023:**\n* Target increase by 2023: $500,000 * 0.10 = $50,000\n* Total target sales in 2023: $500,000 + $50,000 = $550,000\n\n**4. Calculate the required increase from 2022 to 2023:**\n* Sales increase needed: $550,000 - $529,000 = $21,000\n\n**5. Calculate the percentage increase from 2022 to 2023:**\n* Percentage increase: ($21,000 / $529,000) * 100% = **3.97%** (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n**Therefore, the company needs to achieve a 3.97% increase in sales in 2023, relative to their 2022 sales, to reach their target.**",
