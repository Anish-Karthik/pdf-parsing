In this graph, the midline is the x-axis, and the highest point is 2 units above it.

Reducing the Modulus (Signal Strength):**\n\nThe initial signal strength is represented by the modulus of z, which is 2. Reducing it by a factor of \u221a2 gives us a new modulus of 2/\u221a2 = \u221a2.\n\n**3.  Shifting the Argument (Phase):**\n\nThe initial phase is 45\u00b0. Adding the phase shift of 135\u00b0 results in a final phase of 45\u00b0 + 135\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.\n\n**4. Forming the New Complex Number:**\n\nThe trigonometric form of a complex number is given by  r cis(\u03b8), where r is the modulus and \u03b8 is the argument. Using the new modulus (\u221a2) and argument (180\u00b0) we calculated, the final complex number representing the signal strength is \u221a2 cis(180\u00b0).",

Now, we have a right triangle formed by the roof, the solar panel, and a line segment connecting their endpoints. We know one angle is 70 degrees, and another is 30 degrees (the sun's angle of elevation). The remaining angle, which is the angle we need to find, is 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 30 degrees = 60 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the solar panel should be mounted at a 60-degree angle relative to the roof's surface.",

What is this time, to the nearest tenth of a second?",
            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis problem is tricky because it requires a multi-step approach combining understanding of trigonometric functions with problem-solving skills:\n\n1. **Understanding the function:** The function y(t) = -2cos(\u03c0/4(t-3)) + 5 describes the vertical motion of the buoy. \n    * Amplitude: |-2| = 2 feet (the buoy moves 2 feet above and below its average position)\n    * Period: (2\u03c0)/(\u03c0/4) = 8 seconds (time for one complete cycle)\n    * Phase Shift: 3 seconds to the right (the graph is shifted 3 units to the right)\n    * Vertical Shift: 5 feet upwards (the average position of the buoy is 5 feet above the resting water level)\n\n2. **Visualizing the problem:** Imagine the buoy bobbing up and down. We need to find the time it takes for the buoy to travel from its highest point down to a point 3 feet above its average position.\n\n3. **Setting up the equation:**\n   * The highest point the buoy reaches is 5 (vertical shift) + 2 (amplitude) = 7 feet.\n   * We want to find the time (t) when y(t) = 3 feet.\n   * So, we need to solve the equation: -2cos(\u03c0/4(t-3)) + 5 = 3\n\n4. **Solving for t:**\n   * Subtract 5 from both sides: -2cos(\u03c0/4(t-3)) = -2\n   * Divide both sides by -2: cos(\u03c0/4(t-3)) = 1\n   * Take the inverse cosine of both sides: \u03c0/4(t-3) = 0  (The cosine function equals 1 at 0 radians)\n   * Multiply both sides by 4/\u03c0: t-3 = 0\n   * Add 3 to both sides: t = 3 seconds. This is the time the buoy is at its peak.\n\n5. **Finding the time difference:** Since the buoy reaches its peak at t=3 seconds, and we want to know how long it takes to go from the peak to 3 feet above average position, we know the time difference is **0 seconds** because it's already there.\n\nTherefore, the time it takes for the buoy to go from its highest point to a point 3 feet above its average position is **0 seconds**.\n",

She then changes direction and walks for 80 meters on a bearing of 120\u00b0 measured clockwise from north.  To reach the final corner of the triangular plot, she must walk due west. What is the magnitude and direction (measured clockwise from east) of the final displacement vector the surveyor must take to reach the last corner?",
            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "This problem combines vectors and trigonometry to determine displacement. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Visualize the Problem**\n\n   Imagine a coordinate system with the base point as the origin. The surveyor's first movement is 50 meters along the positive x-axis (east). The second movement is at 120\u00b0 from north, which translates to 30\u00b0 below the negative x-axis (or 210\u00b0 from the positive x-axis).\n\n**2. Break Down the Vectors**\n\n   *  **Vector 1 (East):** 50 meters along the x-axis can be represented as <50, 0>.\n   *  **Vector 2 (120\u00b0 from North):** We need to find the x and y components of this vector:\n      *  x-component = 80 * sin(30\u00b0) = -40 meters (negative as it's going west)\n      *  y-component = 80 * cos(30\u00b0) = -69.28 meters (negative as it's going south)\n      So, Vector 2 is <-40, -69.28>\n\n**3.  Find the Resultant Vector (First Two Movements)**\n\n   Add the x and y components of the two vectors:\n   *  Resultant Vector = <50 - 40, 0 - 69.28> = <10, -69.28>\n\n**4.  Determine the Final Displacement Vector**\n\n   The surveyor needs to walk due west to reach the starting point. This means the final displacement vector must cancel out the y-component of the resultant vector we just calculated.  Therefore, the final displacement vector will have a y-component of +69.28 meters.\n\n   The x-component of the final displacement vector needs to bring the surveyor back to the starting point. Since the current x-component of the resultant vector is 10 meters east, the final displacement vector must have an x-component of -10 meters.\n\n   Final Displacement Vector:  <-10, 69.28>\n\n**5.  Calculate the Magnitude**\n\n   Magnitude = \u221a((-10)^2 + (69.28)^2) = 70 meters \n\n**6.  Calculate the Direction**\n\n   The angle (\u03b8) of the final displacement vector from the positive x-axis can be found using:\n   tan(\u03b8) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side) = 69.28 / 10\n   \u03b8 = arctan(6.928) = 81.87\u00b0\n\n   Since the vector is in the second quadrant (northwest direction), we need to subtract this angle from 180\u00b0 to get the direction clockwise from east:\n\n   Direction = 180\u00b0 - 81.87\u00b0 = 98.13\u00b0\n\n**Therefore, the magnitude of the final displacement vector is 70 meters, and the direction is 98.13\u00b0 clockwise from east.**",
