Finding the Side Length of the Cube:**\n\n   * The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * base area * height. \n   * Since the pyramid's base coincides with the cube's face, the base of the pyramid is a square with sides equal to the cube's side length.  \n   * The height of the pyramid is also equal to the side length of the cube. \n   * Let 's' be the side length of the cube. \n   * Volume of pyramid = (1/3) * s\u00b2 * s = 64 cm\u00b3 \n   * s\u00b3 = 192 cm\u00b3\n   * s = \u221b192 cm = 4\u221b3 cm \n\n**3.

Since we don't know the slant height of the pyramid to calculate the area of the triangular faces, we can realize that the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces is equal to the area of the square base. This is because if we were to flatten the pyramid, its four triangular faces would perfectly cover the square base.\n   * Total surface area = Surface area of cube - Area of pyramid's base + Area of pyramid's four triangular faces\n   * Total surface area =  96\u221b9 cm\u00b2 - 16\u221b9 cm\u00b2 + 16\u221b9 cm\u00b2 = 96\u221b9 cm\u00b2\n\n**Therefore, the total surface area of the remaining solid is 96\u221b9 cm\u00b2.**",

Formulate Equations:**\n   * **Surface Area (SA):**  \n      * Cylindrical part: 2\u03c0rh + \u03c0r\u00b2 (including the circular base)\n      * Hemispherical lid: 2\u03c0r\u00b2\n      * Total SA:  2\u03c0rh + \u03c0r\u00b2 + 2\u03c0r\u00b2 = 600\u03c0\n      * Simplifying: 2rh + 3r\u00b2 = 600  \n   * **Volume (V):**\n      * Cylindrical part: \u03c0r\u00b2h\n      * Hemispherical lid: (2/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n      * Total Volume: V = \u03c0r\u00b2h + (2/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n\n**3. Express Volume as a Function of One Variable:**\n   * From the SA equation, solve for h: \n      * 2rh = 600 - 3r\u00b2\n      * h = (600 - 3r\u00b2) / (2r)\n   * Substitute this value of h in the volume equation:\n      * V = \u03c0r\u00b2 * [(600 - 3r\u00b2) / (2r)] + (2/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n      * V = 300\u03c0r - (3/2)\u03c0r\u00b3 + (2/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n      * V = 300\u03c0r - (5/6)\u03c0r\u00b3\n\n**4. Find the Critical Points:**\n   * To maximize V, find the derivative dV/dr and set it equal to 0:\n      * dV/dr = 300\u03c0 - (5/2)\u03c0r\u00b2 = 0\n      * Solve for r:\n         * (5/2)\u03c0r\u00b2 = 300\u03c0\n         * r\u00b2 = 120\n         * r = \u221a120 = 2\u221a30 cm (Since radius cannot be negative)\n\n**5. Determine the Height:**\n   * Substitute the value of r back into the equation for h:\n      * h = (600 - 3(2\u221a30)\u00b2) / (2 * 2\u221a30)\n      * h = (600 - 360) / (4\u221a30)\n      * h = 60 / \u221a30 = 2\u221a30 cm \n\n**6. Verify Maximum Volume:**\n   * Use the second derivative test to confirm that this value of r gives a maximum volume. Calculate d\u00b2V/dr\u00b2: \n      * d\u00b2V/dr\u00b2 = -5\u03c0r \n      * At r = 2\u221a30 cm, d\u00b2V/dr\u00b2 is negative, indicating a maximum point.\n\n**Solution:**\n* The radius of the cylindrical base (r) should be **2\u221a30 cm**. \n* The height of the cylindrical portion (h) should be **2\u221a30 cm** to maximize the volume of the jewelry box while maintaining the specified surface area.\n",

A plane cuts through the cone parallel to its base, creating a smaller cone at the top and a frustum at the bottom.  The ratio of the volume of the smaller cone to the volume of the frustum is 1:7. Determine the distance of the cutting plane from the base of the original cone.",
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe have a cone sliced parallel to its base, resulting in a smaller, similar cone at the top and a frustum (a cone with its top sliced off) at the bottom. Our goal is to find the distance from the cut to the base of the original cone.\n\n**2. Using Similar Triangles:**\n\n* Let the height of the smaller cone be *h* cm.\n* The height of the frustum will then be (12 - *h*) cm.\n* Since the plane cuts parallel to the base, the smaller cone and the original cone are similar triangles.\n* This means their corresponding side lengths are proportional.  Let the radius of the smaller cone's base be *r* cm. We can set up a proportion:\n\n   *r*/5 = *h*/12\n\n**3. Volume Ratios:**\n\n* We're given that the volume ratio of the smaller cone to the frustum is 1:7. Let's express this mathematically.\n* Volume of a cone = (1/3)\u03c0*r\u00b2*h\n* Volume of the smaller cone = (1/3)\u03c0*r\u00b2*h\n* Volume of the original cone = (1/3)\u03c0*5\u00b2*12 = 100\u03c0 \n* Volume of the frustum = Volume of original cone - Volume of smaller cone = 100\u03c0 - (1/3)\u03c0*r\u00b2*h\n\n* Now we can set up the ratio:\n [(1/3)\u03c0*r\u00b2*h] / [100\u03c0 - (1/3)\u03c0*r\u00b2*h] = 1/7\n\n**4. Solving for h:**\n\n* Simplify the volume ratio equation:\n  *r\u00b2*h / (300 - *r\u00b2*h) = 1/7\n\n* Cross-multiply:\n  7*r\u00b2*h = 300 - *r\u00b2*h\n\n* Combine like terms:\n  8*r\u00b2*h = 300\n\n* Substitute the proportion we got from similar triangles (*r*/5 = *h*/12  or  *r* = 5*h*/12): \n  8*(5*h*/12)\u00b2 * h = 300\n\n* Simplify and solve for *h*:\n  (50/144) * h\u00b3 = 300\n  h\u00b3 = 864\n  h = \u221b864 = 9.52 cm (approximately)\n\n**5. Finding the Distance:**\n\n* The distance of the cutting plane from the base is the height of the frustum.\n* Distance = 12 cm - 9.52 cm = 2.48 cm (approximately)\n\n**Therefore, the distance of the cutting plane from the base of the original cone is approximately 2.48 cm.** ",
