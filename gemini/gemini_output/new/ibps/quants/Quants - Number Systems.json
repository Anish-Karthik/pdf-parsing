Reducing Exponents using Modulo:**\n   - To find the units digit of 3^1234, divide the exponent (1234) by the cycle length (4): 1234 \u00f7 4 = 308 remainder 2.  This means 3^1234 will have the same units digit as 3^2, which is 9.\n   - Do the same for 7^5678: 5678 \u00f7 4 = 1419 remainder 2.

The bakery wants to make 192 cookies.  There are 4 cups of flour in a bag.  To make 192 cookies, how many bags of flour does the bakery need, keeping in mind they must use whole bags?\n**Answer Choices**: \n",
            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "First find how many times larger the desired batch of cookies (192) is than the original recipe (48 cookies): 192 cookies / 48 cookies = 4 times larger.\n\nSince the desired batch is 4 times larger, multiply the original flour amount by 4 to find the total flour needed: 2 1/4 cups * 4 = 9 cups of flour.\n\nFinally, divide the total flour needed by the amount of flour per bag to determine the number of bags needed: 9 cups / 4 cups/bag = 2.25 bags.\n\nSince the bakery can only use whole bags, they would need to purchase 3 bags of flour to have enough.",

Multiply this by the largest single-digit prime number, written in base-5.

            "reasoning": "Let's break down the riddle step-by-step:\n\n1. **\"Days in a week, expressed in base-7\"**: There are 7 days in a week. In base-7, the number 7 is represented as 10 (1 group of seven and 0 ones). \n\n2. **\"Largest single-digit prime number, written in base-5\"**: The largest single-digit prime number is 7. To convert 7 to base-5, we find the largest power of 5 less than 7 (which is 5) and see how many times it fits in. We have one '5' and 2 left over.  So, 7 in base-5 is represented as 12 (1 group of five and 2 ones).\n\n3. **Multiplication in respective bases**: Now we need to multiply 10 (base-7) by 12 (base-5).  To avoid confusion, let's convert both numbers to base-10:\n    * 10 (base-7) = 7 (base-10)\n    * 12 (base-5) = 7 (base-10)\n\n    Therefore, the multiplication becomes 7 * 7 = 49\n\n4. **\"Convert the result to base-10\"**:  Our result, 49, is already in base-10. \n\nTherefore, the sacred number that unlocks the chamber is 49.",

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Find a common ratio for all colors:**\n\n* To compare all three colors, we need a common ratio. Notice that the ratio of green marbles is present in both given ratios.  \n* To make the green marble portions equal, find the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 (from the first ratio) and 2 (from the second ratio). The LCM of 5 and 2 is 10.\n* Adjust the ratios to have 10 representing the green marbles:\n    * Red:Green = 3:5 = **6:10**\n    * Green:Blue = 2:3 = **10:15**\n\n**2. Combine the ratios:**\n\n* Now we have a combined ratio of Red:Green:Blue = 6:10:15\n\n**3. Calculate the reduction in red marbles:**\n\n* 20% of the red marbles are removed, so we need to find 20% of 6 (the initial number of red marbles in our ratio).\n* 20/100 * 6 = 1.2\n\n**4. Adjust the number of red marbles:**\n\n* Subtract the removed red marbles from the initial number: 6 - 1.2 = 4.8\n\n**5. Determine the new ratio of red to blue marbles:**\n\n* The new ratio is 4.8:15. To simplify, we can multiply both sides by 10 to get rid of the decimal: 48:150. \n* This ratio can be further simplified by dividing both sides by their greatest common factor, 6, resulting in a final ratio of **8:25**.\n\nTherefore, the new ratio of red marbles to blue marbles is 8:25.",
