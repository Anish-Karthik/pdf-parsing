Since we need to find the shortest path, it's helpful to 'unfold' the cube to see the faces more clearly. \n\n2. **Possible Paths:** There are multiple ways to reach the yellow face from the red face. One approach is to move across one edge to reach an adjacent face, then across another edge to reach the yellow face. This would require traversing two edges.\n\n3. **Vertex Constraint:** However, the rule about not passing through the same vertex twice complicates things. If we follow the initial approach, we'll inevitably revisit a vertex when trying to reach the center of the yellow face.\n\n4. **Optimal Solution:** The key is to visualize a path that takes us to the yellow face without revisiting a vertex.  We can achieve this by moving across two edges to reach the opposite edge of the yellow face. From there, we only need to move across one more edge to reach the center of the yellow face.\n\n5. **Minimum Edges:** Therefore, the minimum number of edges you need to traverse is **three**.",
