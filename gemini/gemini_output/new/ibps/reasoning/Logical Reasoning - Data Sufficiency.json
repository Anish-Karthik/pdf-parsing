For example, if x = 6 and y = -7, then x + y = -1, which is not greater than 10.\n\n* **Statement 2:** y > 5  tells us that y is greater than 5.

For example, if x = -8 and y = 6, then x + y = -2, which is not greater than 10.\n\n* **Combining Statements 1 and 2:**  We know x > 5 and y > 5.

To find the number of vanilla cakes, we can set up a proportion:\n     (70 cakes / 100% ) = (420 chocolate cakes / x%)\n     - Solving for x, we get x = 600%  This means 420 chocolate cakes represent 600% of the vanilla cakes.\n     - Since we know 30% of the cakes are vanilla, we can calculate the number of vanilla cakes by dividing the total number of cakes (600%) by 30%:\n       (600% / 30%) * 1 vanilla cake = 20 vanilla cakes\n\n2. **Finding the ratio of chocolate to vanilla:**\n   - The ratio of chocolate cakes to vanilla cakes is 420 : 20.
