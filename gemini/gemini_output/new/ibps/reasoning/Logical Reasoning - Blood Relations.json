Considering only those present at the gathering, what is the maximum possible number of people in this family?",
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to break down the solution to find the maximum number of people:\n\n* **Start with the minimum:** We have four couples, meaning 8 people (4 husbands + 4 wives).\n* **Maximize daughters:**  Two couples have *only* daughters, so to maximize the family size, assume each of these couples has the maximum possible number of daughters (let's say 2 daughters each for now).\n* **Other couples' children:** The other two couples must have at least one child each. To maximize the family size, assume each of these couples has one son and one daughter. \n* **Three generations:** To have three generations, we need at least one child from the younger generation to have a child of their own.  Since we're maximizing, assume one of the daughters from the second generation has a child. \n\n**Calculations:**\n\n* **First generation:** We don't have information about the first generation, but since there are three generations present, we know there must be at least two people in the first generation (to be the parents of the second generation).\n* **Second generation:** 8 people (4 couples) \n* **Third generation:** 4 daughters (2 couples x 2 daughters each) + 2 sons + 2 daughters (2 couples x 1 son and 1 daughter each) + 1 grandchild = 9 grandchildren \n* **Total:** 2 (first generation) + 8 (second generation) + 9 (third generation) = **19 people**\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of people in this family is 19.",

            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to solve the relationship between G and E:\n\n**1. Visualize the Setup:**\nImagine a circular table with seven spots. Since they are facing inwards, 'right' and 'left' will be from their perspective, not ours.\n\n**2. Place Key Individuals:**\n* **D and G:** G is third to the right of D. Place them on your circle, leaving space for two people between them.\n* **B, E, and F:** B (mother of F) is second to the left of E (her son). This means E is to the right of B, with one space between them. Place them tentatively.\n* **A and C:** C (sister of E) sits to the immediate left of A, and A is G's father. Since we know where G is, and there's a connection between C and E, try fitting A and C into the arrangement.\n\n**3. Final Arrangement:**\nBy carefully considering the relative positions, you'll arrive at the following arrangement (one possibility):\n\n* **G** - - **D** - **C** - **A** - **E** - **B** - **F**\n\n**4. Determine the Relationship:**\nFrom the arrangement, we can see that:\n* A is the father of G.\n* A is beside E, and C (E's sister) is to A's left.\n\nTherefore, **G and E are cousins.**\n",

            "reasoning": "Let's break down Gaurav's movements step-by-step:\n\n1. **Starts facing east, walks 10 meters north:** This sets up his initial position.\n2. **Turns left, walks 5 meters:** Now he's facing west and has moved 5 meters in that direction.\n3. **Turns right, walks 15 meters:** He's facing north again and has moved a total of 25 meters north from his starting point (10 meters initial + 15 meters now).\n4. **Turns left, walks 10 meters:** He's facing west again and is 15 meters west from his position after step 2.\n\nNow, let's analyze Rani's movements:\n\n1. **Facing west, walks 5 meters backward:** This means she's essentially walking 5 meters east.\n2. **Turns right, walks 10 meters:** Now she's facing south and has moved 10 meters in that direction. \n3. **Meets her father-in-law, who is 5 meters to the west of his son:** This tells us the relative position of Rani's husband (her father-in-law's son) to her father-in-law. \n\n**Key Point:**  Gaurav and Priya are facing each other directly from opposite directions. Since Priya is Rani's daughter, and we know Rani's husband is somewhere nearby, we can deduce that Gaurav is standing opposite Rani's husband.\n\nTherefore, Gaurav is the **brother-in-law** of the son of Rani's father-in-law.",
