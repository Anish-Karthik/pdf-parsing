This is subjective. Some viewers might prefer character development or a strong plot over constant action.\n\n* **Statement 2:** This assumes that book adaptations are always inferior to the source material. While this is sometimes true, there are exceptions. A film might excel in areas the book couldn't (visuals, pacing, etc.).\n\n* **Statement 3:**  This assumes that all fans of a genre are homogenous in their tastes.
