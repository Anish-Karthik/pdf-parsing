            "reasoning": "This alphanumeric series combines multiple patterns:\n\n**1. Alternating Letters and Numbers:** The series alternates between letters and numbers (Z1A3Y6...).\n\n**2. Alphabetical Pattern:** The letters follow a pattern of moving one step forward, then two steps backward in the alphabet:\n   - Z \u2192 A (Forward 1)\n   - A \u2192 Y (Backward 2)\n   - Y \u2192 B (Forward 1)\n   - B \u2192 X (Backward 2)\n   - And so on...\n\n**3. Numerical Pattern:** The numbers initially increase by 2, then 4, then 6, and so on, creating an expanding difference:\n   - 1 \u2192 3 (+2)\n   - 3 \u2192 6 (+3)\n   - 6 \u2192 8 (+2)\n   - 8 \u2192 12 (+4)\n   - 12 \u2192 13 (+1)\n   - 13 \u2192 18 (+5)\n   - 18 \u2192 20 (+2)\n   - 20 \u2192 24 (+4)\n\n**Error Identification:** The error lies in the numerical pattern. Instead of 'C13', it should be 'C14' to maintain the expanding difference. \n\n**Therefore, the incorrect term is 'C13'.**",
