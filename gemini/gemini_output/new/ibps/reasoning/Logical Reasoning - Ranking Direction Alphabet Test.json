They are playing a game with the following rules:\n\n* **Round 1:** Everyone shifts two places to their right.\n* **Round 2:** Everyone shifts one place to their left.\n* **Round 3:**  Everyone shifts three places to their right.\n\nInitially, Priya is facing North. After each round, the direction they face changes based on their movement.\n**instructions**: Determine the net change in position (in terms of the number of sides of the hexagon) and the final facing direction of each student after 3 rounds.  Use '+' for clockwise and '-' for anti-clockwise shifts. For directions, use N for North, E for East, W for West, and S for South. \n\nFor example, if Rohan ends up facing West and is one position clockwise from his starting point, write 'Rohan: +1, W'. \n**example**: Let's say Urvi is initially facing East. After Round 1, she moves two places right and faces South-West.  In Round 2, she moves one place left, now facing South. Finally, after three places right in Round 3, she ends up facing North-West, which is two positions clockwise from her starting point. So the answer would be 'Urvi: +2, NW'.\n",
