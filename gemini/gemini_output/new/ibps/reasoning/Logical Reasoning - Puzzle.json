            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe start with the Roman numeral 'VII' which is 5 + 1 + 1 = 7.\n\n**Analyzing the Arrangement:**\n\nLooking at the matchsticks, we need to find a way to form a different valid Roman numeral by moving only one.\n\n**The Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the movable matchstick:** The most obvious candidate is the middle matchstick forming the 'V'.\n2. **Experiment with movements:** Moving the matchstick to the left side creates the Roman numeral 'XI' which represents 11.\n\n**Verification:** 'XI' is a valid Roman numeral and represents the number 11, making this the correct solution.",

Combining Clues:**\n   - \"The Indigo house is three houses away from the Violet house.\" tells us there are two houses between them.\n   - \"Neither the Violet house nor the Indigo house is at an end of the street.\" implies they are somewhere in the middle.\n\n**2. Possible Arrangements:** Considering the above, we have a few possible arrangements for Violet (V) and Indigo (I), keeping two spaces between them: \n   -  _ _ V I _ _ _\n   -  _ _ I V _ _ _\n\n**3. Placing Red and Orange:** \"The Red house is immediately next to the Orange house\" limits their positions. They can be placed together at either end of the existing arrangement or in the middle.\n\n**4. Integrating Green and Yellow:** \"The Green house is to the right of the Yellow house, but not immediately next to it\" means there's at least one house between Green (G) and Yellow (Y). This information is crucial for determining the final order.\n\n**5. Placing Blue:** The clue \"The Blue house is not at either end of the street\" eliminates two potential spots for it. \n\n**6. Final Deduction:** By carefully trying to fit the Red/Orange (R/O) and Green/Yellow (G/Y) pairs into the possible arrangements, considering the restrictions on Blue (B), we arrive at the only logical order:\n\n_ V R O B I G Y\n\n**7.

The rule 'no elements sharing a side or corner' is key, making it a spatial reasoning puzzle as well. \n2. **Strategic Placement:** Start with one element, say Fire (F). Place it in a corner.

The only way to do so without touching is in the opposite corner and an edge, creating a diagonal pattern:\n\n  F - F\n  - - -\n  F - -\n\n4. **Introduce Other Elements:** Now place the Water (W) elements.

Define the Events:**\n\n* **A:** The sum of the numbers rolled is even.\n* **B:** At least one die lands with a blue face up.\n\n**2. Calculate the Probabilities:**\n\n* **P(B):**  The probability of at least one blue face up is easier to calculate by finding the probability of its complement (no blue faces) and subtracting from 1.\n    * Probability of the first die NOT landing blue: 2/3\n    * Probability of the second die NOT landing blue: 2/3\n    * Probability of both dice NOT landing blue: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9\n    * Therefore, P(B) = 1 - (4/9) = 5/9 \n\n* **P(A and B):** The probability of both events happening (even sum AND at least one blue face).  We can think about the combinations:\n    * Blue - Blue: Can have even or odd sum.\n    * Blue - Red: Can have even or odd sum. \n    * Blue - Yellow: Can have even or odd sum. \n\nSince the color doesn't directly dictate even or odd sums in any combination, we can simply calculate the probability of getting an even sum regardless of color, which is 1/2 (as there are 3 even and 3 odd numbers on a standard die).\n\n* **P(A | B):** This is the probability of event A (even sum) happening GIVEN that event B (at least one blue face) has already occurred.  We use the formula:\n\n    *  P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n    *  P(A | B) = (1/2) / (5/9) = 9/10\n\n**Therefore, the probability of the sum being even given that at least one die lands on blue is 9/10.** ",

Remaining Books:**\n   * We started with 20 books and have used 12, leaving us with 20 - 12 = 8 books to distribute.\n\n**3. Maximizing the Largest Section:**\n   * To maximize one section, we need to minimize the others while still following the rules.\n   * We can't have sections with the same number of books, so the remaining sections must hold a minimum of 4, 5, and 6 books (in addition to the initial 3 in each).\n\n**4. Calculation:**\n   * This means the largest section can have a maximum of 20 (total books) - 4 - 5 - 6 = 5 books.\n\n**Therefore, the librarian can place a maximum of 5 books in the largest section.**",

The inspector has narrowed down the suspects to four individuals: the Butler, the Maid, the Gardener, and the Chef. Each suspect was in a different room of the manor at the time of the theft, and each claims to have been engaged in a specific activity. Use the clues below to deduce who stole the necklace and which room they were in: \n\n**Clues:** \n1. The Butler claims to have been polishing the silver in the Dining Room, but the inspector notes the silver hasn't been polished in weeks. \n2. The Maid, who claims to have been dusting the Library, has a smudge of what appears to be silver polish on her apron. \n3. The Gardener was indeed tending to the roses in the Greenhouse, as evidenced by the fresh soil under his fingernails, but he also has a cut on his hand consistent with the thorns on the rose bushes. \n4. The Chef was preparing dinner in the Kitchen, but there's a distinct lack of noise or activity coming from that room, and a faint scent of roses lingers in the air. \n5. The thief left muddy footprints near the window in the Library, and a single white rose, missing its thorns, was found on the floor near the Lady's jewelry box. \n\n**Your task is to identify the thief, the room where the theft took place, and explain your reasoning.**\n**Difficulty Level**: 7/10\n",
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the puzzle: \n\n**1. Analyzing the Clues:**\n   * **Clue 1:** This clue casts doubt on the Butler's alibi. He's clearly lying about polishing the silver. \n   * **Clue 2:** The silver polish on the Maid's apron contradicts her story of dusting the Library. This makes her a prime suspect. \n   * **Clue 3:** This clue confirms the Gardener was in the Greenhouse but also reveals he could have obtained a cut consistent with the thorns on the roses. \n   * **Clue 4:**  This clue suggests the Chef may not be telling the truth about preparing dinner. The scent of roses is suspicious. \n   * **Clue 5:** This is crucial evidence. The muddy footprints in the Library and the rose (missing thorns) strongly suggest the thief was in the Library and had recently been near the roses. \n\n**2. Connecting the Clues:**\n   * We know from Clue 5 the theft likely occurred in the **Library** due to the footprints and the rose. \n   * The Maid (Clue 2) was in the Library and had silver polish on her, which could have easily transferred onto her apron while planting the rose from the Greenhouse. \n   * The rose missing its thorns (Clue 5) connects to the Gardener (Clue 3) who had a cut on his hand from the rose thorns. It's plausible he gave the rose to the Maid. \n\n**3. Deduction:**\n   * The most logical conclusion is that the **Maid** stole the necklace. She was in the **Library** (proven by footprints), had a motive (planting the rose to divert suspicion), and her alibi is weak (silver polish). \n   * It's possible the Gardener was an accomplice, providing the rose, but there's not enough evidence to definitively incriminate him. \n\n**Therefore, the answer is the Maid stole the necklace from the Library.** ",

Since yellow is adjacent to the other four colors, a possible arrangement is to place yellow in the center of the net and the other colors around it. \n\n**Step 3: Incorporating the Third Clue**\n\n- The third clue is crucial: When red is facing up, blue is adjacent. This means that on our net, red and blue must be beside each other.\n\n**Step 4: Deducing the Opposite Face**\n\n- Given our deductions, the only possible arrangement leaves the face opposite yellow undetermined.
