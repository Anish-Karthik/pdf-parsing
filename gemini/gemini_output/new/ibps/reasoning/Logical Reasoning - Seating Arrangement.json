This doesn't definitively tell us about either person's chances of selection, just how their selections impact each other.\n* **Clue 2:** Indicates a strong likelihood of David and Emily being selected or rejected together.

Corner Positions:** Since people with circular cards occupy corners, and Bella has a circular card, she must be at a corner. Alex is opposite Bella, so he is also at a corner.\n\n**2.  Alternating Cards:**  The rule about triangular cards means the seating pattern around the table must alternate: circle-triangle-circle-triangle, etc.\n\n**3. Placing Carlos and David:** Carlos (triangle) is to David's right. Because of the alternating pattern, David must be holding a circle card and therefore sits at a corner. There are two possible corner positions for David, let's analyze one:\n\n* **Scenario 1:** Let's say David is at the corner to Bella's immediate right. This forces Carlos into the position to David's right (which is not a corner, fulfilling the rules). \n\n* **Scenario 2:** If David is at the corner to Bella's left, Carlos would have to be at a corner (to David's right), which violates the rules. Therefore, this scenario is incorrect.\n\n**4. Placing Emily:** We know Emily has a triangular card.

Let's temporarily place them in our diagram:\n\n     ?     \n  ?       ?\n\nIshaan(C)  Hritik\n\n  Jai      Photography\n     ?     \n\n* **Clue 2:** Neither the one who likes Coding nor the one who enjoys Gardening are adjacent to Hritik. This eliminates Coding and Gardening as possibilities for the positions immediately to Hritik's right and left.\n\n**3. Further Deductions:**\n\n* **Clue 4:** The person who enjoys Coding sits second to the right of the one who enjoys Reading. Since the positions around Hritik are ruled out, let's try fitting this clue into the remaining spots.  We get two possibilities:\n\n     Reading  \n  ?       ?\n\nIshaan(C)  Hritik\n\n  Jai      Photography\n     Coding  \n\n**OR**\n\n     Coding     \n  ?       ?\n\nIshaan(C)  Hritik\n\n  Jai      Photography\n     Reading  \n\n* **Clue 5:** Kunal doesn't enjoy Reading, and Farhan is not seated adjacent to Ishaan.  In both of our possibilities above, only one spot remains next to Ishaan. This means Farhan must occupy that spot.  Let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n**Possibility 1:**\n\n     Reading  \n  Farhan    ?\n\nIshaan(C)  Hritik\n\n  Jai      Photography\n     Coding  \n\nIn this possibility, Kunal can't enjoy Reading (Clue 5), and the only spot left for him would be next to Hritik, violating Clue 2. Therefore, Possibility 1 is incorrect. Let's analyze Possibility 2:\n\n**Possibility 2:**\n\n     Coding     \n  ?       Farhan \n\nIshaan(C)  Hritik\n\n  Jai      Photography\n     Reading  \n\n* In this arrangement, Kunal cannot be adjacent to Hritik (Clue 2), so Kunal must enjoy Reading.  This leaves Gautam to occupy the only remaining spot and Painting as the only hobby left. \n\n**Final Arrangement:**\n\n     Coding     \n  Gautam    Farhan\n\nIshaan(C)  Hritik\n\n  Jai      Photography\n     Kunal(R) \n\n**Therefore, Gautam enjoys Painting.**",

Placing the Friends:**\n   * **Start with a fixed pair:** The most straightforward clue is that Catherine and David sit opposite each other. Place them arbitrarily across from each other on your circle. \n   * **Branch out:** Now use the clues that branch directly from Catherine and David's positions.  Eric sits two places to David's right. Determine which direction is right from David's perspective (clockwise or counter-clockwise based on your initial placement) and count two spots to place Eric. \n   * **More connections:**  We know Bella sits three places to the right of Adam. Since we don't know their exact positions yet, keep this information in mind but don't place them yet. \n   * **Strategic placement:** Fiona is not a neighbor of Eric or Adam. This negative information helps us narrow down Fiona's possible positions.  Mark the spots next to Eric and Adam as unavailable for Fiona.\n   * **Connecting the dots:** We know George sits to Fiona's immediate right and Heather sits two places to George's left.  Experiment with placing Fiona and George in the remaining spots, considering the restrictions on Fiona's placement.

Let's try different possibilities, remembering to keep the Grey shirt person three spaces from Priya.\n\n**Step 6:** After careful trial and error with the remaining clues, we arrive at the following arrangement:\n\n[Pink] - [Sanjay/Violet] - [Umesh/Yellow] - [Waqar/Orange]\n\n[Rahul/Blue]-----------------------[Tanvi/Green]\n\n[Priya/Red] - [Queen/Grey] - [Varun] - [Empty]\n\n**Step 7:** By carefully reviewing our final arrangement against all the clues, we can see it fulfills every condition. \n\n**Therefore, Queen is wearing the Grey shirt.**",

            "question": "Eight renowned scientists from different fields - Alice (astrophysicist), Brian (biologist), Carol (chemist), David (doctor), Emily (engineer), Felix (physicist), Gina (geologist), and Henry (historian) - are seated around a circular table for a multidisciplinary conference.  They are each seated facing the center of the table.  Deduce their seating arrangement based on the following clues:\n\n1. The biologist is seated directly opposite the historian.\n2. The physicist is seated three seats to the right of the historian.\n3. Neither the doctor nor the engineer is seated adjacent to the physicist.\n4. The chemist is seated two seats to the left of the astrophysicist.\n5. The geologist is not seated adjacent to the historian.\n6. The doctor and the engineer are not seated opposite each other.\n\nQuestion: If the historian is considered to be at the 12 o'clock position on the table, who occupies the 4 o'clock position?",
            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "Let's break down the clues and deduce the seating arrangement step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1: Establishing a Starting Point**\n\nWe are told to consider the historian, Henry, as being at the 12 o'clock position. This gives us a reference point to begin our deductions.\n\n**Step 2:  Using Direct Relationships**\n\n* Clue 1 tells us the biologist (Brian) sits directly opposite the historian (Henry). Therefore, Brian is at the 6 o'clock position.\n* Clue 2 states the physicist (Felix) is three seats to the right of the historian. Counting clockwise, Felix would be at the 3 o'clock position.\n\n**Current Arrangement:**\n\n* 12 o'clock - Henry (Historian)\n* 3 o'clock - Felix (Physicist)\n* 6 o'clock - Brian (Biologist)\n\n**Step 3:  Negative Constraints**\n\n* Clue 3 states neither the doctor (David) nor the engineer (Emily) sits next to the physicist (Felix). This eliminates the 2 o'clock and 4 o'clock positions for both David and Emily.\n* Clue 5 tells us the geologist (Gina) does not sit next to the historian (Henry).  This eliminates the 11 o'clock and 1 o'clock positions for Gina. \n\n**Step 4:  Multi-Step Deductions**\n\n* Clue 4 states the chemist (Carol) is two seats to the left of the astrophysicist (Alice). Let's consider possible positions for Alice and Carol. If Alice were at the 5 o'clock position, Carol would have to be at the 7 o'clock position. However, this would leave no valid position for Gina (the geologist) as she cannot be adjacent to Henry. Therefore, Alice cannot be at 5 o'clock.\n* The only other valid position for Alice is at the 10 o'clock position. This places Carol at the 8 o'clock position, satisfying Clue 4.\n* With the 11 o'clock and 1 o'clock positions eliminated for Gina, she must be at the 9 o'clock position.\n\n**Current Arrangement:**\n\n* 12 o'clock - Henry (Historian)\n* 1 o'clock -  Open\n* 2 o'clock - Open \n* 3 o'clock - Felix (Physicist)\n* 4 o'clock - Open\n* 5 o'clock - Open\n* 6 o'clock - Brian (Biologist)\n* 7 o'clock - Open\n* 8 o'clock - Carol (Chemist)\n* 9 o'clock - Gina (Geologist)\n* 10 o'clock - Alice (Astrophysicist)\n* 11 o'clock - Open \n\n**Step 5: Final Placement**\n\n* Clue 6 states the doctor and engineer are not seated opposite each other. The only remaining positions are 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock, and 7 o'clock.  We need to find two positions that are not directly across from each other. \n* The only valid combination is to place David (doctor) at the 2 o'clock position and Emily (engineer) at the 5 o'clock position. \n\n**Final Arrangement:**\n\n* 12 o'clock - Henry (Historian)\n* 1 o'clock - Open\n* 2 o'clock - David (Doctor) \n* 3 o'clock - Felix (Physicist)\n* 4 o'clock - Open\n* 5 o'clock - Emily (Engineer)\n* 6 o'clock - Brian (Biologist)\n* 7 o'clock - Open\n* 8 o'clock - Carol (Chemist)\n* 9 o'clock - Gina (Geologist)\n* 10 o'clock - Alice (Astrophysicist)\n* 11 o'clock - Open \n\n**Answer:** The 4 o'clock position remains unoccupied.",
