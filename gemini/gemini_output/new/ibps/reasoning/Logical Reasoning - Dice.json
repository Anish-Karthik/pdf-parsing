Analyzing the Visible Faces:**\n   * **Top Die (3):**  We only know the top face. We can deduce that the bottom face is a 4 (since 3 + 4 = 7). However, we don't know its orientation in relation to the other dice. \n   * **Middle Die (Side: 5):**  We know one side is 5, meaning its opposite face is 2.  However, we don't know if the 2 is facing up towards the top die or down towards the bottom die. \n   * **Bottom Die (Side: 2):**  We know one side is 2, meaning its opposite face is 5.  We don't know its orientation in relation to the other dice.\n\n**3. The Key Deduction:** Notice that both the middle and bottom dice have a visible '2' and a hidden '5'.  Since a '5' and a '2' must be on adjacent faces (not opposite), this tells us how the middle and bottom dice are aligned. Imagine rotating the bottom die so its visible '2' is facing the same direction as the middle die's visible '2'.
