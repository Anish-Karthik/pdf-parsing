Here's how to solve it:\n\n1. **Analyze the Example:** We need to find how 'CAT' results in 28 using the positions of letters in the alphabet.\n2. **Assign Numerical Values:**\n   * C = 3 (as it's the 3rd letter)\n   * A = 1\n   * T = 20\n3. **Test Operations:** Try different operations to see if we can get 28 using 3, 1, and 20.  Adding them directly (3+1+20) gives us 24.  Let's try something else.\n4. **Identify the Pattern:** Notice that if we multiply the first two numbers (3 x 1 = 3) and then add the third number (3 + 20), we get 23. We are close to 28. What if we add the positions of the first and last letters (3+20=23) and then multiply it by the position of the middle letter (23*1 = 23)? This does not work either. The rule must involve some other combination of arithmetic operations. \n5. **Refine the Rule:**  What if we square the position of the middle letter (1 x 1 = 1) and then add the product of the positions of the first and third letters (3 x 20 = 60)? 1 + 60 = 61.  We are closer. Let's try squaring the position of the first letter (3*3=9), adding the position of the second letter (9+1=10) and finally multiplying by the position of the third letter (10 * 20 = 200). This does not work.  What if we multiply the positions of the first and third letters (3 x 20 = 60),  divide this number by 2 (60/2=30) and subtract the position of the second letter (30-1=29)?  We are very close! Perhaps we need to adjust the divisor slightly. Let's try dividing by 2.1 instead of 2 (60/2.1 = 28.57). This is very close to 28. It is possible that the rule involves rounding the result to the nearest whole number.\n6. **Verify the Rule:** The rule seems to be: (Position of First Letter x Position of Third Letter) / 2.1 -  Position of Second Letter = Output. Round the output to the nearest whole number. \n",
