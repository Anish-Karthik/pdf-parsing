      "question": "John was always the life of the party, but his friends noticed that he was often withdrawn and quiet when alone.  They realized that  _______.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "reasoning": "The proverb that best fits this scenario is \"All that glitters is not gold.\" John appears to be outgoing and vibrant, but his true personality is different.  This proverb highlights the contrast between appearance and reality, suggesting that things are not always what they seem. The other options are not as relevant to the situation. \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" is too general, and \"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\" and \"A stitch in time saves nine\" are not related to the concept of appearance vs. reality.",

      "correct_option": "A",
      "valid": "```json\n{\n  \"valid\": false\n}\n```\n\nThe question is grammatically correct. However, the answer \"All that glitters is not gold\" does not fit the context of the question. The answer is a proverb that suggests that appearances can be deceiving. While it may be relevant to the idea that John's outward personality might be different from his inner self, it doesn't directly address the specific observation of his friends.\n\nA more fitting answer might be something like:\n\n* **John might have a difficult time expressing himself when he's alone.** \n* **He may be using his outgoing personality as a way to cope with feelings of loneliness or insecurity.** \n* **John could be struggling with social anxiety or introversion.**\n\nThese answers directly address the contrast between John's behavior in social settings and when he's alone. \n"

      "question": "A _____ bird catches the worm.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "reasoning": "This proverb suggests that those who are quick and proactive are more likely to succeed. The blank should be filled with a word that describes a bird that is known for its quickness and alertness.  The correct answer is 'early' because an early bird is one that wakes up and starts its day before others, thus increasing its chances of catching a worm.

      "difficulty": "easy",
      "reasoning": "The proverb that best fits the context is \"Practice makes perfect\".  It conveys the idea that consistent effort and dedication will lead to improvement and ultimately, mastery. The young artist is struggling with her painting, which implies a lack of skill or experience. Her mentor encourages her to keep practicing, suggesting that with time and effort, she will eventually achieve her desired outcome.  The other options are not as relevant to the situation:  \"Don't put all your eggs in one basket\" is about risk management; \"Haste makes waste\" is about avoiding rushing; \"The grass is always greener on the other side\" is about appreciating what you have.

      "reasoning": "The proverb \"A little learning is a dangerous thing\" implies that limited knowledge can be harmful as it can create a false sense of understanding and lead to poor judgment. Therefore, the missing word should reflect this idea of potential harm or misguided confidence.\n\n* **Option (a) arrogance** -  A little learning can lead to arrogance because someone with limited knowledge might overestimate their abilities. \n* **Option (b) complacency** - Limited knowledge can lead to complacency, where someone feels satisfied with their understanding without striving to learn more. \n* **Option (c) ignorance** -  This option contradicts the meaning of the proverb. The proverb highlights the danger of *some* knowledge, not the absence of knowledge. \n* **Option (d)  humility** - This option is also incorrect. The proverb does not suggest that a little learning leads to humility.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **(a) arrogance**, as it aligns best with the proverb's message about the potential pitfalls of limited knowledge.",

      "reasoning": "The idiom 'chasing the clock' means to be working quickly to complete something before a deadline. In this sentence, the phrase 'seems like we're still ... the clock' implies a sense of urgency and a struggle to finish on time. Therefore, 'chasing' is the correct word to fill the blank, as it accurately describes the feeling of being under time pressure and trying to catch up. \n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **stalling:** Stalling means delaying or postponing, which doesn't fit the context of trying to finish a project. \n* **breaking:** Breaking the clock doesn't make sense in the context of time management. \n* **stopping:** Stopping the clock would mean pausing the time, not working against it. \n\nTherefore, 'chasing the clock' is the only idiom that accurately reflects the sentence's meaning.",

The sentence describes a situation where a business venture failed, leading to a lack of funds and an inability to meet financial obligations. This aligns perfectly with the meaning of \"broke.\" \n\nOption A: \"broke\" is the correct word from the idiom. It directly signifies being without money and aligns with the sentence context. \n\nOption B: \"destitute\" means extremely poor and lacking basic necessities, while the sentence focuses on financial ruin specifically. While related, \"destitute\" is not the exact idiom. \n\nOption C: \"bankrupt\" is also related to financial ruin, but it has a more formal legal connotation.  The sentence doesn't explicitly mention a legal process. \n\nOption D: \"penniless\" describes having no money at all. While accurate, it doesn't convey the broader idea of being financially ruined, which the sentence implies. \n\nTherefore, \"broke\" is the most fitting word to complete the idiom and accurately reflect the context of the sentence.",

In this context, the negotiations are described as \"a tough cookie\" because both sides are stubborn and unwilling to compromise. This makes it difficult to reach an agreement, indicating that the negotiations are challenging and require perseverance. \n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the idiom:** The sentence mentions \"negotiations\" and implies a challenging situation. This suggests an idiom related to difficulty or stubbornness. \n2. **Analyze the context:** The phrase \"both sides refusing to budge on their demands\" indicates a lack of compromise and a tense situation. This reinforces the idea of a challenging scenario.\n3. **Apply the idiom:** The idiom \"a tough cookie\" fits the context, as it describes a person or situation that is difficult to handle.  \n4. **Eliminate incorrect options:**  The other options are not appropriate in this context:  \"a piece of cake\" means something easy, \"a hot potato\" refers to a controversial issue, and \"a bad apple\" represents someone who spoils things.  These do not fit the situation of the negotiations being difficult and stubborn.",

      "reasoning": "The proverb \"A rolling stone gathers no moss\" suggests that constant movement can prevent stagnation. However, it can also be interpreted to imply that by moving around too much, you might not be able to build strong foundations or establish roots in a particular place. Therefore, the blank needs to be filled with an idiom that signifies a lack of stability or a lack of focus on a specific goal. \n\n**Step-by-step analysis:** \n1. **Understand the proverb:** The proverb implies that constant change can be beneficial for avoiding stagnation but can also lead to missing out on opportunities for growth.\n2. **Identify the missing concept:** The sentence emphasizes the potential negative side of constant change, suggesting that missing out on opportunities for growth is a possible outcome.\n3. **Choose the appropriate idiom:** The idiom \"all over the place\" signifies a lack of focus, direction, and stability. This aligns perfectly with the concept of constantly moving without establishing roots.\n4. **Verify the correctness:** The complete sentence now reads \"The proverb \"A rolling stone gathers no moss\" implies that constant change can prevent stagnation. However, it can also suggest that you might miss out on opportunities for growth if you are too all over the place.\" This sentence accurately conveys the dual interpretation of the proverb and demonstrates how the chosen idiom captures the essence of the negative implication.\n\nTherefore, \"all over the place\" is the most appropriate idiom to complete the sentence, considering its meaning and how it aligns with the proverb's message.",

The other options do not accurately capture the essence of the situation.  \"A stitch in time saves nine\" refers to the importance of addressing problems promptly, \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" implies avoiding hasty judgments based on outward appearances, and \"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\" encourages taking immediate opportunities rather than waiting for potentially better ones.
