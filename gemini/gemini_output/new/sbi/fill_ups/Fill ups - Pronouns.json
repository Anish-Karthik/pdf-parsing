Identify the pronoun: The blank needs a pronoun to replace the noun phrase \"the professor\".\n2. Determine the pronoun's function: The pronoun functions as the object of the preposition \"for\".

Check for pronoun-antecedent agreement: \"Whom\" agrees with the singular antecedent \"professor.\"\n5.

            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "The sentence describes the archaeologists' discovery of treasures within the hidden chamber.  We need a possessive adjective that indicates ownership belonging to the archaeologists. Of the options, only \"their\" signifies ownership by a plural subject, which is \"the archaeologists.\"  The other options are incorrect: \"my\" refers to a single speaker, \"your\" refers to the listener, \"his\" refers to a male singular subject, and \"its\" refers to a singular non-human subject.",

            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "The correct pronoun to use here is \"in\" because it refers to a location.  We are resting *within* the shade of the tree. The preposition \"in\" is used to indicate a location, and the pronoun \"we\" is in the nominative case.  The pronoun \"we\" is the subject of the verb \"decided.\"  It is important to use the correct case of pronoun when using prepositions, as this can change the meaning of the sentence. For instance, \"under\" would be used to indicate something is beneath the shade of the tree, and \"into\" would be used to indicate the act of moving into the shade of the tree.",

            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "The correct pronoun is \"its\" because it refers to the singular noun \"committee.\" The committee is a singular entity, even though it is made up of multiple people.  The pronoun \"their\" is incorrect because it is a plural pronoun and does not agree with the singular subject \"committee.\" The other options, \"our\" and \"we,\" are also incorrect because they do not refer to the committee. \"Our\" refers to the speaker and others, while \"we\" refers to the speaker and a group that includes the listener. \n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. **Identify the antecedent:** The antecedent is the word or phrase that the pronoun refers to. In this sentence, the antecedent is \"committee.\" \n2. **Determine the pronoun's case:** The pronoun needs to be in the possessive case because it is modifying the noun \"findings.\" \n3. **Check for agreement:** The pronoun must agree with the antecedent in number (singular or plural).  \"Committee\" is singular, so the pronoun must also be singular. \n4. **Choose the correct pronoun:** Based on these steps, the correct pronoun is \"its.\" \n5. **Eliminate incorrect options:** The options \"their,\" \"our,\" and \"we\" are incorrect because they are either plural pronouns or do not refer to the committee.",

We need a pronoun that agrees in number and gender with the noun.  The correct pronoun is \"it.\"  'They' and 'her' are incorrect because they are plural and feminine, respectively.  'This' could potentially work grammatically but is not the most natural choice in this context, as it refers to something close at hand, while 'it' can refer to something more distant.  Therefore, \"it\" is the most grammatically correct and natural choice for this sentence.",

            "reasoning": "The sentence refers to two maps. The first is described as 'old' and 'worn-out', indicating it is in the past and no longer relevant. The second map is described as 'bright' and 'detailed', implying it is the one being considered for the journey. Since the second map is being introduced and discussed, the correct demonstrative pronoun is 'this'. 'That' would be used for something further away or already mentioned, while 'these' and 'those' are plural and wouldn't apply to a single map.",

            "reasoning": "The correct possessive adjective is \"their\". The sentence refers to the team's excitement about their new stadium. It might be tempting to choose \"its\" because of the phrase \"under construction\". However, \"its\" is used for singular nouns, while \"their\" is used for plural nouns. Since the sentence talks about \"the team\", which is plural, the correct possessive adjective is \"their\".",

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "This sentence requires careful analysis to determine the correct pronoun case. The blank represents the object of the preposition 'to'.  The prepositional phrase 'to ______' modifies the verb 'presented', indicating the recipient of the portrait. Since the recipient is the object of the preposition, the objective case pronoun 'her' is the correct choice.  The other options are incorrect because they are nominative case pronouns, which are used for subjects of verbs or predicate nominatives.",

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "The antecedent of the pronoun is \"committee.\"  Although the sentence includes the phrase \"several brilliant minds,\" which might lead some to think the pronoun should be plural, \"committee\" itself is a singular noun. Therefore, the correct pronoun is \"its.\"  The sentence describes the actions of the committee as a single entity, not the actions of individual members.  The word \"its\" refers to the committee's report, signifying a singular possession.",

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "The correct pronoun is \"its.\" The sentence refers to the leaves of the oak tree, and \"its\" is the possessive pronoun for \"it.\" While the word \"it's\" may seem tempting due to its similar sound, it is a contraction of \"it is\" and doesn't function as a possessive pronoun. The possessive pronoun \"its\" is used to show that the leaves belong to the oak tree. The sentence structure is slightly complex due to the descriptive phrases, requiring the student to correctly identify the subject and its related possessive pronoun.",

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "The correct reflexive pronoun is **itself**. The sentence describes the house as a solitary entity, separate from the past that once filled it with life. The reflexive pronoun emphasizes this separation by showing that the house stands alone, without any external influence or connection.  \n\nThe options 'them' and 'themselves' would be incorrect because they refer to a plural subject, which doesn't align with the singular noun 'house.'  The option 'it' is a personal pronoun and doesn't reflect the action of the house standing alone.  The reflexive pronoun 'itself' accurately reflects the subject's action and emphasizes its isolation.\n\nIn this sentence, the reflexive pronoun 'itself' clarifies that the house is standing alone, without the need for an external entity to abandon it.  It establishes the house as the subject of the action of standing alone, highlighting its independent existence.",

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "This question is tricky because it tests the understanding of \"whose\" as a possessive pronoun referring to the artist's painting. The sentence structure can lead students to mistakenly choose \"who\" or \"whom\" due to the presence of the relative clause. The correct answer is \"whose\" as it functions as the possessive pronoun, indicating ownership of the painting by the artist.  \n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. **Identify the pronoun:** The sentence requires an interrogative pronoun to replace the missing word in the phrase \"___ painting\". \n2. **Analyze the function:** The phrase needs a pronoun that shows possession, indicating that the painting belongs to the artist. \n3. **Consider the choices:**  \"Who\" and \"whom\" are not suitable as they refer to the subject or object of a sentence. \"Whose\"  is the correct choice as it signifies possession.\n4. **Final answer:**  The correct answer is \"whose\" as it accurately connects the artist's ownership of the painting.",

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "This question tests the ability to correctly use pronouns in different parts of a complex sentence, especially when dealing with prepositional phrases.  Let's break it down:\n\n1. **First Blank:** The first blank requires a possessive pronoun since it modifies the noun 'discoveries.' The sentence is referring to the scientist's discoveries.  The pronoun 'his' is the correct choice because it is possessive and agrees with the singular antecedent 'scientist'.\n\n2. **Second Blank:** The second blank needs a pronoun that acts as the object of the verb 'commended.' 'Him' is the correct pronoun choice because it is in the objective case and refers back to the antecedent 'scientist'.\n\n3. **Third Blank:** The third blank requires a possessive pronoun to modify the noun 'contributions.'  Again, 'his' is the correct choice as it agrees with the antecedent 'scientist' and indicates possession. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: 'his, him, his'.  \n\n**Explanation:**  This question is particularly challenging because it involves multiple pronouns within a single sentence, each with a different grammatical function. The test taker must be able to identify the correct pronoun case for each blank and ensure consistency with the antecedent. The use of prepositional phrases further complicates the structure of the sentence, requiring a nuanced understanding of pronoun placement.",
