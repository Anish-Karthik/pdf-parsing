            "reasoning": "The phrasal verb \"give out\" means to distribute or provide something. In this context, the doctor is providing a prescription to the patient. Therefore, the correct phrasal verb is \"gave out.\"  The other options are not appropriate in this context.  \"Gave off\" means to emit something, \"gave up\" means to stop trying, and \"gave in\" means to yield to pressure.",

            "difficulty": "easy",
            "reasoning": "The correct phrasal verb is 'got away'. This phrasal verb means 'passed quickly'. The sentence describes the speaker's feeling of the weekend passing quickly, and the phrase 'got away' best expresses that idea. The other options are not appropriate in this context.  'Get out' typically refers to leaving a place, and 'get in' can mean entering something or becoming involved in something, both of which are unrelated to the passage of time. The sentence focuses on the subjective experience of time passing quickly, making 'got away' the best choice.",

The sentence states that the children were so excited about the trip, they couldn't handle or contain their excitement. The other options are incorrect because they don't fit the context of the sentence.

The other options are not appropriate in this context: 'pick up' means to lift or acquire something, 'pick on' means to tease or bully, and 'pick at' means to eat something in a small, unappetizing way.

This fits the context of the sentence, as the doctor wants the patient to keep taking the medication. \n* **Carry out:** To complete or perform a task. This doesn't fit the context because the sentence is about continuous action. \n* **Carry through:** To succeed in completing something that is difficult. This doesn't fit the context because the sentence is about a simple action of taking medication. \n* **Carry off:** To manage to succeed in doing something that is difficult.
