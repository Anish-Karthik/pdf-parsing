            "reasoning": "The correct collocation is \"cool down\", which is a common phrase used in the context of exercise. It refers to the process of gradually reducing your heart rate and body temperature after physical activity. The other words, \"warm\", \"stretch\", \"relax\", and \"recover\", while related to fitness, do not form a common collocation with \"down\" in this context.",

The other options are less precise in this context: 'invest' refers to putting money into something with the expectation of a return, 'distribute' implies sharing, and 'spend' is too general.\n",
            "difficulty": "easy",
            "reasoning": "The question tests the student's understanding of the collocation 'allocate profits', which refers to setting aside a portion of profits for a specific purpose. The sentence context suggests a planned and directed use of profits, which aligns with the meaning of 'allocate'.  The other options are less accurate:  'invest' implies putting money into something for a return, 'distribute' suggests sharing, and 'spend' is too general and doesn't convey the deliberate allocation of funds.",

The other options are not grammatically correct or do not create a natural-sounding sentence in this context. For example, \"criticism on\" implies a specific target of the criticism, while \"criticism at\" would suggest a location. \"criticism through\" is not a common collocation.

The phrase \"evolution of ancient Egyptian art\" is a typical collocation, highlighting the development and changes in artistic styles over time. The other options are not common collocations in this context. 'Influence' could be used, but it wouldn't be as natural as 'evolution'.

This is a common phrase used in technology contexts to describe the creation of a physical facility for storing and processing data. The other options do not form natural collocations with \"data center.\"  \n\n* **Build a data center:** This is the most common and natural collocation for the sentence. It accurately reflects the action of creating a physical facility for data storage and processing. \n\n* **Construct a data center:** While grammatically correct, \"construct\" is less commonly used than \"build\" in this context, making it less natural. \n\n* **Develop a data center:** \"Develop\" implies a more gradual process of creating something, which doesn't align with the direct action of building a physical structure. \n\n* **Generate a data center:** \"Generate\" doesn't fit the context because it implies creating something new, but a data center is a physical infrastructure, not something that is generated.

The phrase \"constant _______ of social media\" is a common way to describe the overwhelming amount of information and activity found on these platforms. The answer choices are all words that can be used to describe information or activity, but \"buzz\" is the most common and appropriate word for this context.  The other options are less likely to be used in this way. \n\nThe difficulty level is set as easy because the collocation \"buzz of social media\" is relatively common and the answer choices are straightforward.

The correct answer is \"growth\" because it directly relates to increasing market share. The other options are either too general or don't fit the context of the sentence.

Other options are incorrect because they don't fit the context: \n\n* **Impact** is too general and doesn't imply danger.\n* **Damage** is more specific to physical harm, not necessarily a threat.\n* **Influence** refers to an effect, but not necessarily a negative one.",

While \"splash\" and \"drop\" are used for liquids, \"handful\" is more appropriate for larger quantities like vegetables.  The context of \"enhancing aroma and flavor\" implies a small amount being added, making \"pinch\" the most suitable choice.\n\nThe question requires the student to understand the specific uses of various collocations and the nuances of the sentence's context.

The sentence describes a post that gained widespread attention and popularity on social media, which is the definition of a viral post. \n\nThe other options are not as strongly associated with social media or the concept of rapid spread: \n\n* **trending**  - while related to popularity, it implies a gradual increase in interest rather than sudden explosion. \n* **popular** - is too general, and doesn't convey the rapid spread on social media. \n* **widespread** -  while suggesting broad reach, lacks the dynamic element of social media virality. \n\nTherefore, \"viral\" is the most suitable choice for the sentence, accurately depicting the rapid spread and significant engagement of the influencer's post.",

Folk art is often created by people within a specific community or tradition, typically with a focus on local customs and beliefs. The other options, 'abstract', 'impressionist', and 'minimalist', do not align with the characteristics described in the sentence.

'at a period of' and 'on a period of' are not common collocations, and 'with a period of' is grammatically incorrect in this context. The step-by-step reasoning is as follows: 1. Identify the noun: The noun in question is 'period'. 2. Consider common prepositions: The most likely prepositions to be used with 'period' are 'in' and 'during'. 3. Analyze the context: The sentence describes a state of being (rapid growth), making 'in' the most suitable preposition. 4. Eliminate incorrect options: The remaining options are not grammatically correct or are not commonly used with the noun 'period'.",

This makes the question a medium difficulty level as it requires the student to consider common usage and not just the possibility of drinking from different containers.  \n\nHere's a breakdown of why the answer choices are correct or incorrect:\n\n* **a) cup:** While a cup can be used for juice, it's less common for orange juice specifically.\n* **b) bowl:** Bowls are typically used for solid food, not liquids.\n* **c) glass:** This is the most common and standard collocation for serving orange juice, making it the correct answer.\n* **d) plate:** Plates are used for solid food, not liquids.",

'Increase' implies an upward trend, suggesting the company is adding to its existing investments. This is a plausible option, but the sentence doesn't explicitly state the company is increasing its investments.  'Invest' is a more general term that doesn't specify the direction of change. It's not incorrect, but it lacks the specific nuance needed for the sentence.  'Diversify' implies spreading investments across different areas to reduce risk. This is the most suitable option because the sentence mentions 'recent market volatility,' suggesting the company is seeking a more balanced investment strategy.  'Boost' indicates a sudden and significant increase, which doesn't align with the context of 'planning' and 'despite market volatility.' Therefore, the correct answer is 'diversify' because it best captures the company's strategy to spread investments across different sectors to mitigate risk.",

'Implement' means to put something into effect, which implies the strategy already exists and needs to be enacted.

This aligns with the context of the sentence, which describes a period of difficulty within the technology sector, but emphasizes the company's resilience in maintaining its market position.\n\nThe distractors are designed to be tricky.  \n* 'Market volatility'  is a broader concept that encompasses price fluctuations, but doesn't necessarily imply a negative decline. \n* 'Market consolidation' usually refers to a period of industry consolidation, where smaller companies are acquired by larger ones, rather than a decline in the overall market. \n* 'Market analysis' is a general term for studying and evaluating a market, and doesn't directly relate to a decline in value. \n\nTherefore, the correct collocation is 'market downturn' because it accurately reflects the negative trend in the technology sector described in the sentence.",

In this context, it perfectly fits the idea of fighting jet lag. \n* **Overcome:**  While 'overcome' can be used to describe dealing with challenges, it doesn't have the same sense of active fight as 'combat'. \n* **Reduce:**  This option implies lessening the effects of jet lag, but not actively fighting against it. \n* **Minimize:** Similar to 'reduce', this option focuses on lessening the impact of jet lag, but not actively battling it. \n\nThe sentence uses the phrase 'jet lag', which is a specific travel-related term, making the context more challenging and requiring the test taker to identify the specific collocation that conveys the intended meaning.",
