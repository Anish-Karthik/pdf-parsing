This indicates a past action that was completed before the present state of exhaustion. \n\n**Step 2: Determine the verb:** The action is 'playing' in the park.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Past Perfect Continuous:** The Past Perfect Continuous tense is formed by using 'had been' + the present participle of the verb.

The past participle of \"complete\" is \"completed\".\n\nStep 5: Combine the elements: \"will have\" + \"completed\" = \"will have completed\".\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"will have completed\".",

The context states that John has been studying for a long period (all week) and the action continues (for hours every day). Therefore, the correct answer should reflect a continuous action in the past that is still ongoing.  The verb phrase \"has been studying\" fits this description perfectly.  The other options are incorrect because:\n\n* **studied:** This is in the Simple Past Tense and doesn't convey the ongoing nature of the action.\n* **is studying:** This is in the Present Continuous Tense and implies the action is happening right now, but not necessarily for an extended period.\n* **will be studying:** This is in the Future Continuous Tense and describes an action that will occur in the future.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"has been studying\" because it accurately reflects the continuous action that started in the past and continues until the present.",

This type of conditional expresses a hypothetical situation in the past and its unrealized consequence.\n2. **Identify the blank:** The blank requires a verb tense that reflects the past hypothetical condition.

The correct answer is the only option that accurately reflects the Future Perfect Continuous tense, emphasizing the ongoing action and its extended duration before the specific future time.",

            "reasoning": "This question tests the understanding of the present perfect tense and its relationship with duration and completion. The sentence describes an action that started in the past (beginning of the season) and continues to the present (they are still playing well). The use of 'yet' indicates that the action hasn't been completed (winning a championship). The correct answer is 'have been playing' because the action is ongoing and hasn't reached its conclusion. It signifies the action is in progress and continues up to the present moment.  The other options like 'played', 'have played', 'has played' are incorrect because they signify a completed action, not an ongoing action.  'Played' is simple past tense, which implies the action has finished. 'Have played' and 'Has played' could be correct in other contexts but not in this scenario because the context implies an ongoing action. Therefore, 'have been playing' is the correct answer to complete the sentence and convey the intended meaning.",

            "reasoning": "The correct tense for the blank is the **past participle** 'carved'.  The sentence describes a past event that is completed and has a lasting effect (Petra's existence).  The sentence structure uses the passive voice, where the action ('carving') is done to the subject ('Petra') rather than the subject performing the action.  This passive voice structure often uses the past participle with 'be' as the helping verb. Here's why other options are incorrect:\n\n* **a) carving:**  This is the present participle, which is used for ongoing actions. It doesn't accurately depict the completed act of carving.\n* **b) was carving:** This is the past continuous tense, implying an action in progress at a specific point in the past.  The sentence suggests a completed act, not an ongoing one.\n* **c) will have been carving:**  This is the future perfect continuous tense, describing an action that will continue for a period in the future.

            "reasoning": "This sentence uses the third conditional, which describes hypothetical situations in the past. The first clause, 'If I ______ (be) more careful with my finances last year,' requires the past perfect tense ('had been') to express an action that didn't happen in the past. The second clause, 'I ______ (not need) to take on so much debt,' requires the conditional perfect tense ('wouldn't have needed') to express the consequence that wouldn't have occurred if the first action had been different.

The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the sequence of events: \n\n* **Reached:**  This is in the simple past tense, suggesting the speaker arrived at the same time as the train left.\n* **Had been reaching:** This implies a continuous action that was completed before the train left, which doesn't fit the context.\n* **Will have reached:** This refers to a future action, not a past action.",

The sentence is in the simple past tense, describing a completed action in the past. 'Made' is the correct answer because it accurately reflects the past tense of the phrasal verb 'make their way'. The sentence tells us that the hikers completed the action of descending the mountain path after the sun began to set. Therefore, the correct past tense verb to fill the blank is 'made'.",

The correct tense is the past participle, as it describes an action completed in the past and whose effects are still visible. The phrase 'were slowly being reclaimed' indicates an ongoing process in the past, implying that the weathering and neglect happened before this process began. The passive voice is crucial here because it focuses on the ruins themselves (the object) as the receiver of the action (weathering and neglect). \n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Action:** Weathering and neglect\n2. **Object:** Ancient ruins\n3. **Passive voice construction:** The object (ancient ruins) becomes the subject, and the verb 'be' is used in the appropriate tense along with the past participle of the verb 'to weather' and 'to neglect.'\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 'weathered and neglected' because it accurately reflects the passive voice construction and the past participle tense, highlighting the long-term effects of the action on the ruins.",

Therefore, the correct answer is 'had been tending,' as it accurately portrays the ongoing nature of the keeper's actions. \n\n**Step-by-step breakdown:**\n\n1. **Identify the timeframe:**  The sentence tells us that the keeper's actions were ongoing for 'the past three hours' before the storm. This indicates a duration of time that began in the past and continued until a specific event occurred. \n2. **Identify the action:** The sentence describes the keeper 'tending the lamp,' which is an ongoing activity.\n3. **Combine the timeframe and the action:** To convey the action's duration in the past, we need the Past Perfect Continuous tense, which uses 'had been' followed by the present participle of the verb. Therefore, the correct verb phrase is 'had been tending.'\n4. **Contextual Clues:** The sentence emphasizes the keeper's diligence and preparation, further reinforcing that the lamp-tending was an ongoing activity before the storm's interruption.",

The correct verbs must be in the Future Continuous Tense to reflect this ongoing action. \n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify the time frame:** The sentence indicates the actions will take place 'while the judges are evaluating the projects.'
