This indicates a past action that was completed before the present state of exhaustion. \n\n**Step 2: Determine the verb:** The action is 'playing' in the park.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Past Perfect Continuous:** The Past Perfect Continuous tense is formed by using 'had been' + the present participle of the verb.

This makes the question moderately challenging, as it requires students to recognize the subtle differences between the tenses.\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n1. **Identify the tense:** The sentence uses the phrase \"Next week\" which indicates a future action. \n2. **Determine the subject:** The subject is \"my family and I\", which is a plural subject.\n3. **Choose the correct verb form:** The verb needs to be in the Simple Future Tense and agree with the plural subject.

The correct answer is \"will have been working\" because it accurately reflects the ongoing action that will be completed by a specific future time (next Friday) and will have continued for a period of three months. The other options are incorrect because they either represent the wrong tense, incorrectly conveying the duration of the action, or are not grammatically correct in this context.  For example, 'will be working' only indicates the action will be happening at the specific time in the future, but not its duration. 'Will have worked' indicates the action will be completed at the specific time but does not imply it has been ongoing for a specific duration. 'Will worked' is grammatically incorrect.

The sentence structure uses the passive voice, where the action ('carving') is done to the subject ('Petra') rather than the subject performing the action.  This passive voice structure often uses the past participle with 'be' as the helping verb. Here's why other options are incorrect:\n\n* **a) carving:**  This is the present participle, which is used for ongoing actions. It doesn't accurately depict the completed act of carving.\n* **b) was carving:** This is the past continuous tense, implying an action in progress at a specific point in the past.  The sentence suggests a completed act, not an ongoing one.\n* **c) will have been carving:**  This is the future perfect continuous tense, describing an action that will continue for a period in the future.

The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the sequence of events: \n\n* **Reached:**  This is in the simple past tense, suggesting the speaker arrived at the same time as the train left.\n* **Had been reaching:** This implies a continuous action that was completed before the train left, which doesn't fit the context.\n* **Will have reached:** This refers to a future action, not a past action.",
