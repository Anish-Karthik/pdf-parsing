Option \"b) apply icing\" is the only option that maintains parallel structure with the first action.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the subject:** The subject of the sentence is \"cake.\"\n2. **Determine the correct verb:** The verb must agree with a singular subject. Of the options, \"it\" is the only singular pronoun.\n3. **Analyze the parallel structure:** The sentence uses \"and\" to connect two actions. Both actions should be in the same tense.
