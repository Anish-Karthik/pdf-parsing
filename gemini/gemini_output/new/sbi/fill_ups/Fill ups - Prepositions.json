            "reasoning": "The preposition \"to\" is used to express purpose. It clarifies the reason for going to the library \u2013 to borrow a book.  The sentence conveys that the action of going to the library is directly linked to the purpose of borrowing a book.  Therefore, \"to\" is the correct preposition in this context.",

            "reasoning": "The question tests the understanding of prepositions of frequency in the context of a routine activity. The sentence describes a recurring action that happens on weekends.  The correct preposition of frequency is 'often' as it indicates a regular occurrence but not necessarily every weekend. \n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n* **Always:**  Implies the action happens every weekend without exception.  This doesn't fit the context of a routine that might have variations. \n* **Sometimes:**  Suggests the action happens occasionally, not necessarily regularly. This doesn't align with the 'on weekends' indication. \n* **Never:**  Contradicts the statement, implying the action doesn't occur at all on weekends. \n* **Often:**  Accurately portrays the action happening regularly, but not necessarily every weekend, which is consistent with the context of 'on weekends.'",

The phrase '10:00 PM' refers to a specific point in time. \n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n1. **Identify the preposition:** The sentence requires a preposition to complete the phrase about the time of going to bed.\n2. **Consider the context:** The sentence indicates a specific time, which is 10:00 PM.\n3. **Apply the appropriate preposition:** The preposition 'at' is used to indicate specific times of the day, such as hours, minutes, or seconds. \n4. **Final answer:** Therefore, the correct answer is 'at.'",

The sentence describes the dog moving through the park, so 'across' accurately depicts the direction of movement.

'In' would mean the cat is inside the table, 'under' would mean the cat is below the table, and 'beside' would mean the cat is next to the table.",

The hikers are moving in the same direction as the path, hence 'along' is the appropriate choice.\n\nThe sentence describes a specific type of movement, following a designated path.  Other prepositions like 'through' (going through something) or 'across' (going over something) don't accurately represent the movement described. 'Towards' implies a destination, not necessarily following a path. Therefore, 'along' is the only preposition that logically fits the context.",

'Through' implies movement from one point to another within an enclosed space, like a forest.\n\nOther options are incorrect because they do not fit the context:\n\n* 'On' indicates movement on top of something, which doesn't apply here.\n* 'Into' indicates movement from outside to inside, but the hikers are already inside the forest.\n* 'Around' indicates movement in a circle, which isn't implied in the sentence.",

The sentence implies a direct causal relationship between the illness and the postponement.  The other options are not suitable in this context:\n\n* **because of:**  While \"because of\" is a valid preposition for expressing reasons, it sounds slightly less formal than \"due to\" in this context. \n* **in spite of:**  \"In spite of\" indicates something happening despite a challenge or obstacle, which is not the case here. \n* **despite:**  Similar to \"in spite of\",  \"despite\" implies that the meeting would have happened regardless of the speaker's illness, which contradicts the sentence's meaning.",

This eliminates \"in\", \"beside\", and \"under\" as possibilities.  The most logical preposition here is \"on\".\n\n**Step 2:** The bird feeder is \"dangling\" from something.  This requires a preposition that indicates something hanging from above.  \"Above\" could be used, but it doesn't emphasize the hanging aspect.  \"From\" doesn't fit the context.

It signifies something being part of or belonging to another thing.\n3. **Other prepositions:** Prepositions like 'with' or 'from' are not suitable in this context. 'With' would imply the threads were simply used in the weaving process, not made of the metals. 'From' would suggest the origin of the threads, but not their material.  \n4. **Conclusion:** 'Of' accurately conveys the relationship between the tapestry's threads and the materials they are composed of, making it the correct choice for this sentence.",
