Here's why:\n\n1. **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The subject of the sentence is \"Some of the evidence.\" Even though \"evidence\" is singular, the phrase \"some of\" indicates that we are talking about a portion of the evidence, which is plural. \n\n2. **'Some' as a Plural Determiner:**  When \"some\" is used before a plural noun, it acts as a plural determiner, indicating that more than one item is being considered. This means the verb must agree with the plural subject. \n\n3. **Verb Choice:**  Since \"some of the evidence\" is plural, we need the plural form of the verb \"to be\" in the present tense, which is \"are.\"  The options \"is\" and \"was\" are singular and incorrect.",

            "reasoning": "The subject of the sentence is 'collection,' which is a singular noun despite being a collective noun. Even though 'coins' are plural, the word 'collection' refers to the entire group as a single unit. Therefore, the verb must be singular, making 'has' the correct choice.

Here, the focus is on the group as a whole, so the verb should be singular. \"The cast\" is acting as a single unit, so the correct verb is \"is\". The other options are incorrect because \"are\" is plural and \"was\" is past tense. The phrase \"including the talented Dr. Smith\" is an appositive, which simply adds more information about the cast. It does not change the singular nature of the subject.",

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "This question is tricky because it uses two collective nouns: 'majority' and 'group'. The first blank requires the verb to agree with 'majority', which acts as a singular noun in this context, referring to the group as a whole. The second blank requires the verb to agree with 'group', which also acts as a singular noun, referring to the group as a whole.  Therefore, the correct verbs are 'have' and 'is' respectively. \n\n**Step 1: Analyzing the First Blank**\n The phrase 'the majority of the students' refers to the group of students as a single unit, not individual students. Therefore, 'majority' acts as a singular noun, requiring a singular verb. \n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Second Blank**\n Similarly, 'a small group' refers to the group of students as a single unit. Therefore, 'group' acts as a singular noun, requiring a singular verb.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Correct Verb Forms**\n The correct verb form for the first blank is 'have' because it agrees with the singular noun 'majority'. The correct verb form for the second blank is 'is' because it agrees with the singular noun 'group'.\n\n**Conclusion:** The correct answer choices are 'have' and 'is' because they accurately reflect the subject-verb agreement for each collective noun in the sentence.",

Although the phrase appears complex, it's important to recognize that 'each' always refers to a single item. Since the subject is singular, the verb must also be singular.

Therefore, the correct verb is 'are'.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Subject:**  The subject is 'a group of artisans', which is plural.\n2. **Identify the Verb:**  The verb is missing and needs to be chosen from the options.\n3. **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The verb needs to agree with the subject in number.
