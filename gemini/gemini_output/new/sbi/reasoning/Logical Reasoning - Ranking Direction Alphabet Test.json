            "question": "Imagine a grid where each cell holds a letter from A to Z, starting with A in the top left corner and proceeding row by row to Z in the bottom right.  Use the following code to decipher the movement instructions: \n\n* '+' represents a clockwise rotation of the grid by 90 degrees.\n* '-' represents a counter-clockwise rotation of the grid by 90 degrees. \n* '>' represents shifting all letters one cell to the right, wrapping around from the rightmost cell of a row to the leftmost cell of the next row (e.g., H moves to the position of I, Z moves to the position of A).\n* '<' represents shifting all letters one cell to the left, wrapping around from the leftmost cell of a row to the rightmost cell of the previous row (e.g., I moves to the position of H, A moves to the position of Z). \n\nApply these instructions in order to find the final arrangement of the letters: \n\n1. + > + < \n2. - < - >\n3. + + > - <",

            "reasoning": "This question is tricky because it combines rotations with shifts, and the wrapping effect adds another layer of complexity.  Here's how to break it down:\n\n**Understanding the Code:**\n* **'+':** Turns the grid clockwise, changing row-column orientation. \n* **'-':** Turns the grid counter-clockwise, changing row-column orientation. \n* **'>':**  Shifts letters within the grid's current orientation (rightward wrap). \n* **'<':** Shifts letters within the grid's current orientation (leftward wrap). \n\n**Applying the Instructions:**\nIt's helpful to visualize the grid (even sketching it out) and carefully track the movement of letters through each rotation and shift.  Due to the complexity, listing the intermediate positions of all 26 letters after each step would be very lengthy. The key is to focus on the cumulative effect of the rotations and how they influence the direction of the shifts.\n\n**Let's illustrate with a few key steps:**\n\n* **Initial Grid:** \n ABCDEF\nGHIJKLMN\nOPQRSTU\nVWXYZ\n\n* **After '1. + > + <':**  The two '+' rotations cancel each other out. The '>' shifts all letters one position to the right, and then the '<' shifts them back one position.  The grid returns to its initial state.\n\n* **After '2. - < - >':**  Similar to the previous step, the two '-' rotations cancel each other out. The '<' and '>' shifts also reverse each other's effect. The grid remains in its initial state.\n\n* **3. + + > - <:**  The two '+' rotations result in a 180-degree turn.  The '>' shifts letters to the right (which is now effectively left due to the rotation).  The '-' rotation then brings the grid back to its original orientation. Finally, the '<' shifts letters one position to the left. \n\n**Final Result:** The cumulative effect of all the rotations and shifts is a single leftward shift ('<').  Therefore, the final arrangement is: \nZABCDEF\nGHIJKLMN\nOPQRSTU\nVWXY",

            "reasoning": "Let's break down the clues step by step to establish the order:\n\n**Step 1:** From clues 1 and 2, we understand the guitar and flute players are somewhere in the middle, with at least two spaces between them and three students on either side.\n\n**Step 2:** Clue 3 tells us D and B sit together, away from the musicians. We can represent this as (DB).\n\n**Step 3:** Clue 4 places E and F with three spaces between them. It also clarifies they aren't musicians. This can be represented as (E---F).\n\n**Step 4:** Combining clue 5 with the previous deductions, we can try different placements for G to be two spaces away from F.  However, we need to consider the restrictions posed by the musicians and the (DB) pair. \n\n**Step 5:**  Clue 6 places A at one of the ends.  Since A is reading, he cannot be adjacent to the musicians. This limits the placement possibilities for the musicians, (DB), and the (E---F) groups. \n\n**Step 6:** By carefully trying to fit the pieces together, we find the following arrangement works, satisfying all conditions:\n\n A - E - G - (Flute) - D B - H - (Guitar) - F\n\n**Step 7:** Now, if the guitarist and C are moved to the ends with the guitarist on the left, the new arrangement becomes:\n\n(Guitar) - F - A - E - G -  H - D B - C \n\n**Final Step:** Counting from D in the new arrangement, the fourth student to D's right is C. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.",
