We can now test values for a and b to see if they produce valid values for c. \n\nIf a = 2 and b = 2, then (2 - 1)(2 - 1) = c + 1, so c = 0. This is impossible.\nIf a = 2 and b = 3, then (2 - 1)(3 - 1) = c + 1, so c = 1. This is a possible solution.\nIf a = 2 and b = 4, then (2 - 1)(4 - 1) = c + 1, so c = 2. This is a possible solution.\n...\nWe continue in this way, testing values for a and b and finding the corresponding value for c. We find that there are a few possible combinations of a, b, and c that satisfy the given condition. However, we are asked to find the product of all three dice rolled, which is abc. Calculating this product for each possible combination, we find that the only possible product is 12 (2 x 3 x 2, or 2 x 2 x 3). \n\nTherefore, the product of all three dice rolled is 12.",

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to solve this tricky stacked dice problem: \n\n**1. Understanding Dice Mechanics:**\n   * **Opposite Faces:** On a standard die, opposite faces always add up to 7 (e.g., 1 & 6, 2 & 5, 3 & 4).\n   * **Adjacent Faces:** Knowing one number, you can deduce its adjacent faces, as they cannot be the opposite number. \n\n**2. Analyzing the Visible Faces:**\n   * **Top Die (3):**  We only know the top face. We can deduce that the bottom face is a 4 (since 3 + 4 = 7). However, we don't know its orientation in relation to the other dice. \n   * **Middle Die (Side: 5):**  We know one side is 5, meaning its opposite face is 2.  However, we don't know if the 2 is facing up towards the top die or down towards the bottom die. \n   * **Bottom Die (Side: 2):**  We know one side is 2, meaning its opposite face is 5.  We don't know its orientation in relation to the other dice.\n\n**3. The Key Deduction:** Notice that both the middle and bottom dice have a visible '2' and a hidden '5'.  Since a '5' and a '2' must be on adjacent faces (not opposite), this tells us how the middle and bottom dice are aligned. Imagine rotating the bottom die so its visible '2' is facing the same direction as the middle die's visible '2'.  This means the hidden '5' on the bottom die is facing the bottom face of the middle die.\n\n**4. The Answer:** Because standard dice follow a specific arrangement, if a '5' is on the bottom of the bottom die (facing up), then the face touching the middle die must be a '3'. \n\n**Therefore, the number on the bottom face of the middle die is 3.**",

            "question": "A game developer wants to design a dice-rolling mechanic for a board game. The goal is to create a system where players roll two six-sided dice and calculate the absolute difference between the results. However, the developer wants to minimize the probability of rolling a difference of 1, making it a less common outcome in the game. To achieve this, they decide to modify one of the standard six-sided dice. They replace the '6' face on one die with a second '3' face. \n\n What is the percentage decrease in the probability of rolling a difference of 1 when using the modified die compared to using two standard six-sided dice?",
            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Calculate the probability of rolling a difference of 1 with standard dice:**\n\n* There are 36 possible combinations when rolling two six-sided dice (6 sides x 6 sides = 36 outcomes).\n* The combinations that result in a difference of 1 are: (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,3), (4,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,5).\n* There are 10 such combinations.\n* The probability of rolling a difference of 1 with standard dice is 10/36.\n\n**2. Calculate the probability of rolling a difference of 1 with the modified die:**\n\n* The possible combinations with the modified die are still 36.\n*  The combinations that result in a difference of 1 are now: (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,5), (5,4). Note the repetition due to the extra '3' face.\n* There are 12 such combinations. \n* The probability of rolling a difference of 1 with the modified die is 12/36.\n\n**3. Calculate the percentage decrease in probability:**\n\n*  Subtract the probability with the modified die from the probability with standard dice: (10/36) - (12/36) = -2/36\n*  Divide the difference by the original probability (with standard dice) and multiply by 100% to express the change as a percentage: (-2/36) / (10/36) * 100% = -20%\n\n**Therefore, the probability of rolling a difference of 1 actually *increases* by 20% when using the modified die compared to using two standard six-sided dice.**\n\n**The question is tricky because it leads you to assume the probability would decrease.  The wording emphasizes minimizing the probability of a difference of 1, making it easy to overlook the counterintuitive outcome of the modification.**",
