'O' is a vowel. This means we first rotate the star *counter-clockwise* from its current position.  Then we encode 'O' based on its position relative to 'N' on this newly rotated star. \n6. **'V' decoded:**  Determine 'V's position relative to 'O' on the star (which was rotated counter-clockwise in the previous step). \n\nBy meticulously tracking each rotation and the relative positions of letters, we can decode the entire fragment. The complexity arises from the constant star rotations and the conditional counter-clockwise rotations triggered by vowels.",
