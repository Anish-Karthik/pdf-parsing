Also, A > C.  Therefore, A > F is a valid deduction.\n\n   * **(B) E > B:** We know C < E and B = C. Therefore, E > B is a valid deduction.\n\n   * **(C) D < A:** We have D < C and A > C. While this suggests A is likely greater than D, there's no direct relationship established between A and D. This makes (C) potentially invalid. \n\n   * **(D) F < E:** We know F = D and D < E. Therefore, F < E is a valid deduction.\n\n**Conclusion:** Only option (C) cannot be definitively proven from the given information.

Each friend expresses an opinion, but their statements are laced with assumptions. Your task is to analyze these statements and identify the underlying assumptions.\n\n**Statements:**\n\n*  \"The movie was good, but it would have been better if it had focused more on the action scenes.\"\n\n*  \"I heard the book was amazing, so the movie must be a letdown.\"\n\n* \"Anyone who enjoys romantic comedies will absolutely love this film.\"\n\n**Question:** Choose ONE of the statements above and identify the key assumption being made. Explain how this assumption might be flawed or inaccurate. How could the statement be rephrased to be less reliant on assumptions and more objective?",

It presents a common real-life scenario \u2013 subjective opinions \u2013 and requires the test-taker to dissect them. \n\n**Here's a breakdown of the analysis:**\n\n* **Statement 1:** This assumes that a greater focus on action inherently improves a movie. This is subjective. Some viewers might prefer character development or a strong plot over constant action.\n\n* **Statement 2:** This assumes that book adaptations are always inferior to the source material. While this is sometimes true, there are exceptions. A film might excel in areas the book couldn't (visuals, pacing, etc.).\n\n* **Statement 3:**  This assumes that all fans of a genre are homogenous in their tastes. Just because someone enjoys some romantic comedies doesn't mean they'll automatically love *every* film in that genre.\n\n**Re-phrasing:**\n\nLet's take Statement 2 as an example. A less assumptive version could be: \"I've heard great things about the book, so I'm going in with high expectations. It'll be interesting to see how the movie interprets the story.\"\n\n**Why this is 'tricky 9/10':**\n\n* **Subtlety:** The assumptions aren't glaringly obvious, requiring careful reading.\n* **No Single Answer:** Each statement has multiple layers of assumptions that could be unpacked. \n* **Application:** The question goes beyond identification, asking for rephrasing, which demonstrates a deeper understanding of objectivity.",

The key is to find connections between them. Notice that we have both 'Q < T' and 'S = T'.\n\n2. **Applying Transitive Property:** Since 'S = T', we can substitute 'S' for 'T' in the inequality 'Q < T'. This gives us 'Q < S'.\n\n3. **Chaining Inequalities:** Now we have 'P < Q' and 'Q < S'.  Applying the transitive property again, we can conclude 'P < S'.\n\n4. **Final Comparison:** We also know 'R > S'. Combining this with our derived inequality 'P < S', we can definitively say that 'R > P'. \n\nTherefore, the statement 'R > P' must be true.",
