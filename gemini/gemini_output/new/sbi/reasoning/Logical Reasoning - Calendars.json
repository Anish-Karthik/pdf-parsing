Since there are 28 years in a cycle, there was one full cycle (28 years) and part of another (22 years) between the two dates.  \n\n3. **Focus on the remaining years:** Since each 28-year cycle repeats the days of the week, we only need to focus on the remaining 22 years (50 total years - 28 years in a full cycle = 22 years). \n\n4. **Account for leap years:** Over 22 years, there are five leap years that occur (1924, 1928, 1932, 1936, 1940, 1944, 1948, 1952, 1956, 1960, 1964, and 1968 - remember, we aren't counting 1920 or 1968 because we are only concerned with the 22 years *after* 1919). \n\n5. **Calculate the total day shift:**\n    * Each normal year causes a day shift of 1 (365 days / 7 days in a week = 52 weeks with 1 day left over).\n    * Each leap year causes a day shift of 2 (366 days / 7 days in a week = 52 weeks with 2 days left over). \n    * Total day shift: (22 years * 1 day/year) + (5 leap years * 1 extra day/leap year) = 27 days\n\n6. **Determine the day of the week shift:**\n    * Divide the total day shift by the number of days in a week: 27 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks with a remainder of 6 days. \n    * This means the day of the week shifted forward by 6 days. \n\n7. **Find the final day of the week:**\n    * Start with the original day of the week: Monday\n    * Shift forward 6 days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. \n\nTherefore, the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles signing fell on a **Sunday**.",

A century year is a leap year only if it is divisible by 400.\n\n**Applying the Rules to 2100:**\n\n1. **Divisible by 4?** Yes, 2100 is divisible by 4.\n2. **Century Year?** Yes, 2100 ends in 00, making it a century year.\n3. **Divisible by 400?** No, 2100 is not divisible by 400.\n\n**Conclusion:** While 2100 is divisible by 4, the century year exception takes precedence.

This means that on March 8th, the city is still observing standard time.\n\n3. **Standard Time Difference:** Since the city hasn't transitioned to DST yet, the actual time difference remains at 11 hours during the opening ceremony.\n\nTherefore, the organizers need to consider an 11-hour time difference to ensure the attendees can watch the opening ceremony live at 8:00 PM their time.",

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the total time passed on the fast clock:**\n   - From January 1st to February 15th, there are 31 days (January) + 15 days (February) = 46 days.\n   - Total time passed on the fast clock: 46 days * 24 hours/day = 1104 hours\n   - The fast clock shows an additional 10 hours (from 12:00 AM to 10:00 AM on Feb 15th) bringing the total to 1114 hours.\n\n**2. Calculate the time difference created by the fast clock:**\n   - The clock gains 20 minutes every 60 minutes.\n   - Over 1114 hours, the clock gains an extra: (20 minutes / 60 minutes) * 1114 hours = 371 hours and 20 minutes.\n\n**3. Convert the extra time into days and hours:**\n   - 371 hours and 20 minutes is equivalent to 15 days, 11 hours, and 20 minutes.\n\n**4. Subtract the extra time from the time shown on the fast clock to get the actual time:**\n   - Start date on fast clock: February 15th, 10:00 AM \n   - Subtract extra time: 15 days, 11 hours, 20 minutes\n   - Actual Date and Time: January 31st, 10:40 PM\n\n**5. Determine the actual day:**\n   - January 1st was a Monday.\n   - January 31st is exactly 30 days after January 1st.\n   - Since there are seven days in a week, 30 days represent four full weeks plus two additional days (30 / 7 = 4 R 2).\n   - Therefore, the actual day is two days after Monday, which is **Wednesday**.\n\n**Therefore, the actual day and time are Wednesday, January 31st, 10:40 PM.**",

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Finding the Sunday:**\n* A month with five Saturdays means the last Saturday falls on the 29th, 30th, or 31st.\n* To have the third Sunday within the month, the third Saturday must be on the 21st (leaving space for the 28th as the fourth Saturday).\n* Therefore, the third Sunday of the month falls on the 22nd.\n\n**2. Counting Back 100 Days:** \n* We know the celestial event was 100 days before the 22nd.\n* Instead of counting back 100 days individually, we can simplify by using weeks (multiples of 7) to move back faster.\n* 100 days contain 14 full weeks (14 x 7 = 98 days). \n* This means we've accounted for 98 days, and need to count back 2 more days (100 - 98 = 2).\n\n**3. Determining the Day:**\n* Counting back two days from Sunday (the 22nd) brings us to Friday (the 20th).\n* This Friday (the 20th) represents the day that was 100 days before the third Sunday.\n\n**4.  Finding the 1st:**\n*  We are 19 days away from the 1st of the month (20th counting back to the 1st).\n* 19 days contain two full weeks and 5 extra days (19 - (2 x 7) = 5).\n* Counting back five days from Friday (20th) brings us to Sunday.\n\n**Therefore, the 1st of that month fell on a Sunday.**\n",

The Pattern:**\n* Each normal year, the day of the week for January 1st shifts forward by one day.\n* Each leap year, the day of the week for January 1st shifts forward by two days.\n* A cycle of days repeats every 7 days and a cycle of leap years mostly repeats every 4 years.\n\n**3.

Given a user's local time zone, a target time zone, and a desired meeting time in the target time zone, write a function to calculate the equivalent meeting time in the user's local time zone.  Consider daylight saving time (DST) for both time zones, as this can shift the time difference by an hour. Assume you have access to a utility function `isDST(date, timeZone)` which returns `true` if DST is active on the given date and time zone, and `false` otherwise.\n\nFor simplicity, assume all time zones are represented as offsets from UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), e.g., 'UTC-5' for New York or 'UTC+2' for Cairo.\n\n**Input:** \n* `userTimeZone`: String representing the user's local time zone (e.g., 'UTC-7')\n* `targetTimeZone`: String representing the target time zone (e.g., 'UTC+3')\n* `targetTime`: String representing the desired meeting time in the target time zone in 24-hour format (e.g., '15:30')\n\n**Output:**\nA string representing the equivalent meeting time in the user's local time zone in 24-hour format (e.g., '06:30'), or 'Invalid Input' if any input is invalid.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* `userTimeZone` : 'UTC-4' (New York)\n* `targetTimeZone` : 'UTC+2' (Cairo)\n* `targetTime` : '14:00'\n\nLet's assume the date is June 1st. On June 1st, both New York and Cairo observe DST. Therefore:\n\n* New York (UTC-4) with DST becomes UTC-5\n* Cairo (UTC+2) with DST becomes UTC+3\n\nThe total time difference is 8 hours.

For example, 'UTC-7' should yield -7, and 'UTC+3' should yield 3.\n\n2. **Calculate Initial Time Difference:**  Calculate the initial time difference between the two time zones by subtracting the user's time zone offset from the target time zone offset. \n\n3. **Account for Daylight Saving Time:** Using the provided `isDST` function, determine if DST is active in both the user's and the target time zone for the given date (Note: You'll need to extract the date from the context, or it could be passed as an additional parameter). If DST applies to one time zone but not the other, adjust the time difference by 1 hour accordingly.\n\n4. **Calculate the Final Time Difference:**  Add the DST adjustments (if any) to the initial time difference to get the final time difference.\n\n5. **Convert Target Time to User's Local Time:**\n    * Convert the `targetTime` string to hours and minutes.\n    * Apply the final time difference calculated in step 4 to the target time's hours and minutes.\n    * Adjust the hours and minutes if they exceed 24 or fall below 0, wrapping around appropriately.\n\n6. **Format Output:**  Format the resulting hours and minutes back into a string in 24-hour format ('HH:MM').\n\n**Applying this to the example:**\n\n1. **Time Zone Offsets:**  New York: -4, Cairo: +2\n\n2. **Initial Time Difference:** 2 - (-4) = 6 hours\n\n3. **Daylight Saving Time:** Assuming June 1st for the example, both New York and Cairo observe DST, resulting in an additional hour difference.

Ordinary Years vs. Leap Years:**\n   - An ordinary year has 365 days, which is exactly 52 weeks and 1 day.\n   - A leap year has 366 days (52 weeks and 2 days) due to the addition of February 29th.\n\n**2. Day Shift:**\n   - Each ordinary year shifts the day of the week forward by 1. (e.g., If January 1st is a Monday, the next year it will be a Tuesday.)\n   - Leap years shift the day of the week forward by 2.\n\n**3. The 400-Year Cycle:**\n   - A regular century year (e.g., 1700, 1800, 1900) is NOT a leap year unless it's divisible by 400. Thus, the year 2000 was a leap year, but 1900 was not.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n* **Years between:**  2300 - 1900 = 400 years\n* **Leap Years:** In 400 years, there are 97 leap years (every 4 years except for the three century years not divisible by 400). \n* **Ordinary Years:**  400 total years - 97 leap years = 303 ordinary years\n* **Total Day Shift:** (303 ordinary years * 1 day shift) + (97 leap years * 2-day shift) = 497 days\n* **Days in a Week:** 497 days / 7 days/week = 71 weeks with no remainder\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince there's no remainder after dividing the total day shift by 7, the day of the week will be the same.
