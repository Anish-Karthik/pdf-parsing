All the answer choices are divisible by 4, so this alone doesn't give us the answer.\n3. **Apply Century Year Rule:**  Both 1700 and 1800, while divisible by 4, are not divisible by 400, eliminating them as possibilities. \n4. **Remaining Options:** This leaves us with 1724 and 1748.

            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Calculate the target year:** The 50th anniversary of the treaty signing occurred in 1919 + 50 = 1969.\n\n2. **Determine the number of 28-year cycles:** The difference between 1969 and 1919 is 50 years.  Since there are 28 years in a cycle, there was one full cycle (28 years) and part of another (22 years) between the two dates.  \n\n3. **Focus on the remaining years:** Since each 28-year cycle repeats the days of the week, we only need to focus on the remaining 22 years (50 total years - 28 years in a full cycle = 22 years). \n\n4. **Account for leap years:** Over 22 years, there are five leap years that occur (1924, 1928, 1932, 1936, 1940, 1944, 1948, 1952, 1956, 1960, 1964, and 1968 - remember, we aren't counting 1920 or 1968 because we are only concerned with the 22 years *after* 1919). \n\n5. **Calculate the total day shift:**\n    * Each normal year causes a day shift of 1 (365 days / 7 days in a week = 52 weeks with 1 day left over).\n    * Each leap year causes a day shift of 2 (366 days / 7 days in a week = 52 weeks with 2 days left over). \n    * Total day shift: (22 years * 1 day/year) + (5 leap years * 1 extra day/leap year) = 27 days\n\n6. **Determine the day of the week shift:**\n    * Divide the total day shift by the number of days in a week: 27 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks with a remainder of 6 days. \n    * This means the day of the week shifted forward by 6 days. \n\n7. **Find the final day of the week:**\n    * Start with the original day of the week: Monday\n    * Shift forward 6 days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. \n\nTherefore, the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles signing fell on a **Sunday**.",

Work Backwards:** \n* To maximize the location use, the ideal scenario is to film for all 7 days it's available.\n* However, the actor is unavailable on October 8th. Since we can't film past the 7th, this constraint doesn't affect our calculation.\n*  The equipment constraint DOES matter. To have the equipment for the full location availability (Oct 1st-7th), the rental MUST start no later than October 1st (to ensure a full 7 days). \n\n**4.

Calculate the total time passed on the fast clock:**\n   - From January 1st to February 15th, there are 31 days (January) + 15 days (February) = 46 days.\n   - Total time passed on the fast clock: 46 days * 24 hours/day = 1104 hours\n   - The fast clock shows an additional 10 hours (from 12:00 AM to 10:00 AM on Feb 15th) bringing the total to 1114 hours.\n\n**2. Calculate the time difference created by the fast clock:**\n   - The clock gains 20 minutes every 60 minutes.\n   - Over 1114 hours, the clock gains an extra: (20 minutes / 60 minutes) * 1114 hours = 371 hours and 20 minutes.\n\n**3. Convert the extra time into days and hours:**\n   - 371 hours and 20 minutes is equivalent to 15 days, 11 hours, and 20 minutes.\n\n**4.

            "reasoning": "Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Finding the Sunday:**\n* A month with five Saturdays means the last Saturday falls on the 29th, 30th, or 31st.\n* To have the third Sunday within the month, the third Saturday must be on the 21st (leaving space for the 28th as the fourth Saturday).\n* Therefore, the third Sunday of the month falls on the 22nd.\n\n**2. Counting Back 100 Days:** \n* We know the celestial event was 100 days before the 22nd.\n* Instead of counting back 100 days individually, we can simplify by using weeks (multiples of 7) to move back faster.\n* 100 days contain 14 full weeks (14 x 7 = 98 days). \n* This means we've accounted for 98 days, and need to count back 2 more days (100 - 98 = 2).\n\n**3. Determining the Day:**\n* Counting back two days from Sunday (the 22nd) brings us to Friday (the 20th).\n* This Friday (the 20th) represents the day that was 100 days before the third Sunday.\n\n**4.  Finding the 1st:**\n*  We are 19 days away from the 1st of the month (20th counting back to the 1st).\n* 19 days contain two full weeks and 5 extra days (19 - (2 x 7) = 5).\n* Counting back five days from Friday (20th) brings us to Sunday.\n\n**Therefore, the 1st of that month fell on a Sunday.**\n",

Consider daylight saving time (DST) for both time zones, as this can shift the time difference by an hour.

For example, 'UTC-7' should yield -7, and 'UTC+3' should yield 3.\n\n2. **Calculate Initial Time Difference:**  Calculate the initial time difference between the two time zones by subtracting the user's time zone offset from the target time zone offset. \n\n3. **Account for Daylight Saving Time:** Using the provided `isDST` function, determine if DST is active in both the user's and the target time zone for the given date (Note: You'll need to extract the date from the context, or it could be passed as an additional parameter). If DST applies to one time zone but not the other, adjust the time difference by 1 hour accordingly.\n\n4. **Calculate the Final Time Difference:**  Add the DST adjustments (if any) to the initial time difference to get the final time difference.\n\n5. **Convert Target Time to User's Local Time:**\n    * Convert the `targetTime` string to hours and minutes.\n    * Apply the final time difference calculated in step 4 to the target time's hours and minutes.\n    * Adjust the hours and minutes if they exceed 24 or fall below 0, wrapping around appropriately.\n\n6. **Format Output:**  Format the resulting hours and minutes back into a string in 24-hour format ('HH:MM').\n\n**Applying this to the example:**\n\n1. **Time Zone Offsets:**  New York: -4, Cairo: +2\n\n2. **Initial Time Difference:** 2 - (-4) = 6 hours\n\n3. **Daylight Saving Time:** Assuming June 1st for the example, both New York and Cairo observe DST, resulting in an additional hour difference.
