            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to solve this:\n\n* **Understanding the Rule:** The key is that opposite sides of a standard die always sum to 7.\n* **Finding the Opposite:** Since the '3' is facing up, its opposite face must hold the number that, when added to 3, equals 7.\n* **Calculation:** 7 - 3 = 4\n\n**Therefore, the number on the face directly opposite the '3' is 4.**",

            "difficulty": "medium",

Calculate Net Movement in Each Direction:**\n   * **North-South:** He walks 10 steps North + 5 steps North = 15 steps North. He also walks 15 steps South. This means his net movement in the North-South direction is 0.\n   * **East-West:** He walks 5 steps East and 10 steps West. This means his net movement is 5 steps West (10 - 5 = 5).\n\n**3. Determine Final Position and Direction:**\n   * Since his net movement in the North-South direction is 0, he ends up at the same vertical level as his starting point.\n   * He has moved 5 steps West from his starting point.\n   * His last movement was 5 steps North, so he is facing **North**.\n\n**4.

Possible Combinations:**\n   - First, we need to figure out how many different ways we can get a sum of 10 using three dice.

Total Possible Outcomes:**\n   - Each die has 6 sides. Since we're rolling three dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 * 6 = 216.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability:**\n   - Divide the number of successful combinations (where the sum is 10) by the total number of possible outcomes.  \n   - Let's say there are 27 successful combinations (you'll need to list them out to find the exact number). \n   - The probability would be 27 / 216, which can be simplified. \n\n**Important:**  The actual calculation of the number of successful combinations can be a bit tedious.

Nobody drinks Coffee.\n**question**: What color is the house of the musician who lives directly across from the Tea drinker, and what beverage does that musician prefer?\n",
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "Let's break down the clues step by step:\n\n**1. House Numbering & Initial Placement:**\n   - We have houses numbered 1 through 6 clockwise.\n   - We know Espresso is in house #3.\n\n**2. Using Direct Relationships:**\n   - Green house is immediately to the right (clockwise) of the Blue house.\n   - Yellow house (Tea drinker) is directly across from the violinist.\n   - Guitarist is immediately to the left of the Milk drinker.\n\n**3. Placing the Drummer and Pianist:**\n   - The drummer drinks only Water. \n   - The pianist lives two houses to the right of the drummer.  We need to test possibilities to fit them in the circle without contradicting other clues.\n\n**4.  Flutist and Odd Numbers:**\n   - The flutist lives in an odd-numbered house.  This limits the possibilities for the flutist's placement.\n\n**5.  Orange House Exclusion:**\n   - The Orange house is not house number 1. \n\n**6.  Deductions and Placement:**\n   - By carefully combining the clues and eliminating possibilities, we can deduce the positions of each musician and their preferred drink. \n   - For example, we can determine the placement of the Milk drinker and guitarist relative to each other, and then see how that fits within the circle using the remaining clues.\n\n**7. Identifying the Solution:**\n   - Through careful deduction, we find that the musician living directly across from the Tea drinker resides in the **Purple** house and enjoys **Milk**. \n",

Since each symbol must appear only once per row, and we already have '&', the missing symbols must be '@', '#', and '$'.  \n\n2. **Determine the order in the last row:** Observe the last column. It already has '#' and '&'.  Therefore, the missing symbol in the last column must be '$'. This places '$' in the last row, third column. Now, to avoid repetition in columns, '@' must be in the last row, first column and '#' must be in the last row, second column.\n\n3. **Complete the grid:** With the last row filled, we can deduce the rest of the grid by ensuring no symbol repeats in any row or column.

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Renaissance Room**\n* We know: Two Italian paintings, one Dutch sculpture. \n* Since combinations can't repeat, the remaining two artworks must be a sculpture and a tapestry, and neither can be Italian or Dutch. \n* Possibilities: (a) Spanish sculpture, German tapestry (b) German sculpture, Spanish tapestry \n\n**Step 2: Baroque Room** \n* We know: French tapestry. \n* To maintain unique combinations, the remaining artworks must include one French piece (either painting or sculpture) and three non-French pieces. \n\n**Step 3: Impressionist Room**\n* We know: No German art. \n* To be unique and considering previous deductions, this room likely has a heavy concentration of either Spanish or Dutch art. \n\n**Step 4: Modern Room** \n* We know: Spanish painting, German sculpture. \n\n**Step 5: Consolidating Information**\n* The high number of French artworks across the gallery, combined with the Baroque room's limitations, suggests the Baroque room must have at least one French painting and one French sculpture. This ensures a higher count of French art compared to other nationalities.\n* This deduction eliminates the possibility of a French tapestry in the Modern room. \n*  Returning to the Renaissance Room possibilities, if the Renaissance room has a German tapestry, it forces the Modern room tapestry to be Spanish. However, this would mean the Impressionist room has no Spanish or Dutch tapestry, making its combination impossible given previous deductions.  \n* Therefore, the Renaissance room MUST have a Spanish sculpture and a German tapestry. This leaves the Modern room tapestry to be Dutch. \n\n**Step 6: Final Arrangement**\n\n* **Renaissance:** Italian Painting, Italian Painting, Dutch Sculpture, Spanish Sculpture, German Tapestry\n* **Baroque:**  French Tapestry, French Painting, French Sculpture, (Non-French Painting/Sculpture), (Non-French Painting/Sculpture)\n* **Impressionist:** This room's arrangement can be deduced based on the remaining nationalities and artwork types, ensuring no repetition of combinations.\n* **Modern:** Spanish Painting, German Sculpture, Dutch Tapestry, (Non-Spanish/German/Dutch Painting), (Non-Spanish/German/Dutch Sculpture)\n\n**Answer:** The artist of the tapestry in the Modern room is Dutch.
