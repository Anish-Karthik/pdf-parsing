            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe start with the Roman numeral 'VII' which is 5 + 1 + 1 = 7.\n\n**Analyzing the Arrangement:**\n\nLooking at the matchsticks, we need to find a way to form a different valid Roman numeral by moving only one.\n\n**The Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the movable matchstick:** The most obvious candidate is the middle matchstick forming the 'V'.\n2. **Experiment with movements:** Moving the matchstick to the left side creates the Roman numeral 'XI' which represents 11.\n\n**Verification:** 'XI' is a valid Roman numeral and represents the number 11, making this the correct solution.",

            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to solve this:\n\n* **Understanding the Rule:** The key is that opposite sides of a standard die always sum to 7.\n* **Finding the Opposite:** Since the '3' is facing up, its opposite face must hold the number that, when added to 3, equals 7.\n* **Calculation:** 7 - 3 = 4\n\n**Therefore, the number on the face directly opposite the '3' is 4.**",

            "reasoning": "Let's break down the clues and deduce the order:\n\n**1. Combining Clues:**\n   - \"The Indigo house is three houses away from the Violet house.\" tells us there are two houses between them.\n   - \"Neither the Violet house nor the Indigo house is at an end of the street.\" implies they are somewhere in the middle.\n\n**2. Possible Arrangements:** Considering the above, we have a few possible arrangements for Violet (V) and Indigo (I), keeping two spaces between them: \n   -  _ _ V I _ _ _\n   -  _ _ I V _ _ _\n\n**3. Placing Red and Orange:** \"The Red house is immediately next to the Orange house\" limits their positions. They can be placed together at either end of the existing arrangement or in the middle.\n\n**4. Integrating Green and Yellow:** \"The Green house is to the right of the Yellow house, but not immediately next to it\" means there's at least one house between Green (G) and Yellow (Y). This information is crucial for determining the final order.\n\n**5. Placing Blue:** The clue \"The Blue house is not at either end of the street\" eliminates two potential spots for it. \n\n**6. Final Deduction:** By carefully trying to fit the Red/Orange (R/O) and Green/Yellow (G/Y) pairs into the possible arrangements, considering the restrictions on Blue (B), we arrive at the only logical order:\n\n_ V R O B I G Y\n\n**7.

The inspector has narrowed down the suspects to four individuals: the Butler, the Maid, the Gardener, and the Chef. Each suspect was in a different room of the manor at the time of the theft, and each claims to have been engaged in a specific activity. Use the clues below to deduce who stole the necklace and which room they were in: \n\n**Clues:** \n1. The Butler claims to have been polishing the silver in the Dining Room, but the inspector notes the silver hasn't been polished in weeks. \n2. The Maid, who claims to have been dusting the Library, has a smudge of what appears to be silver polish on her apron. \n3. The Gardener was indeed tending to the roses in the Greenhouse, as evidenced by the fresh soil under his fingernails, but he also has a cut on his hand consistent with the thorns on the rose bushes. \n4. The Chef was preparing dinner in the Kitchen, but there's a distinct lack of noise or activity coming from that room, and a faint scent of roses lingers in the air. \n5. The thief left muddy footprints near the window in the Library, and a single white rose, missing its thorns, was found on the floor near the Lady's jewelry box. \n\n**Your task is to identify the thief, the room where the theft took place, and explain your reasoning.**\n**Difficulty Level**: 7/10\n",
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the puzzle: \n\n**1. Analyzing the Clues:**\n   * **Clue 1:** This clue casts doubt on the Butler's alibi. He's clearly lying about polishing the silver. \n   * **Clue 2:** The silver polish on the Maid's apron contradicts her story of dusting the Library. This makes her a prime suspect. \n   * **Clue 3:** This clue confirms the Gardener was in the Greenhouse but also reveals he could have obtained a cut consistent with the thorns on the roses. \n   * **Clue 4:**  This clue suggests the Chef may not be telling the truth about preparing dinner. The scent of roses is suspicious. \n   * **Clue 5:** This is crucial evidence. The muddy footprints in the Library and the rose (missing thorns) strongly suggest the thief was in the Library and had recently been near the roses. \n\n**2. Connecting the Clues:**\n   * We know from Clue 5 the theft likely occurred in the **Library** due to the footprints and the rose. \n   * The Maid (Clue 2) was in the Library and had silver polish on her, which could have easily transferred onto her apron while planting the rose from the Greenhouse. \n   * The rose missing its thorns (Clue 5) connects to the Gardener (Clue 3) who had a cut on his hand from the rose thorns. It's plausible he gave the rose to the Maid. \n\n**3. Deduction:**\n   * The most logical conclusion is that the **Maid** stole the necklace. She was in the **Library** (proven by footprints), had a motive (planting the rose to divert suspicion), and her alibi is weak (silver polish). \n   * It's possible the Gardener was an accomplice, providing the rose, but there's not enough evidence to definitively incriminate him. \n\n**Therefore, the answer is the Maid stole the necklace from the Library.** ",

            "reasoning": "Here's how to solve this puzzle step-by-step:\n\n**1. Visualize the Setup:**\nImagine a circle with six spaces representing the houses. It's helpful to sketch this out.\n\n**2. Connect Clues 1 & 2:**\n* **Clue 1:**  Tells us there's a two-space gap between the Red house and the house opposite Green. Let's mark these possibilities on our sketch. \n* **Clue 2:** Tells us there's a three-space gap between the Yellow and Blue houses. Mark these possibilities as well. \n\n**3.  Integrate Clue 3:**\n* **Clue 3a:**  Orange is immediately to the right of Purple. This limits placement options significantly. \n* **Clue 3b:** Purple cannot be next to Yellow. This further restricts the possibilities.\n\n**4. Deduce through Overlap:** \nBy now, you'll see certain positions on your sketch are more constrained than others.  Start testing potential placements of the Orange/Purple pair. Since they are linked, placing them helps determine the positions of other houses based on the previous clues. \n\n**5.  The Solution:**\nWork through the possibilities, eliminating those that lead to contradictions. The correct order, starting from Red and going clockwise, is:\n\n**Red - Yellow - Green - Purple - Orange - Blue**\n\n**Explanation of the Logic:**\n* The placement of Red and Green, following clue 1, is key.  \n* Once you correctly position Orange and Purple (using clue 3 to eliminate incorrect placements), the remaining houses fall into place based on clues 1 and 2.",

The encoding is based on the position of letters in a 3x3 grid, read row by row:\n\n1 2 3\nA B C\nD E F\n\nSo, 'ABC' represents 'A', 'DEF' represents 'D', 'ABE' represents 'B', and so on.\n**puzzle**: Decode the message to find the missing word:  'BDC  ?

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "Let's break down the code:\n\n* **Grid Representation:** Each three-letter sequence corresponds to a position on the 3x3 grid.\n* **Positional Significance:** The position of a letter within the three-letter sequence matters. For example, 'ABC' and 'BAC' represent different grid positions and hence, different letters.\n\n**Decoding the Message:**\n\n1. **BDC:**  'B' is in the second position, 'D' in the first, and 'C' in the third. This corresponds to the grid position '213', which represents the letter 'E'.\n\n2. **CFE:** 'C' is in the first position, 'F' in the third, and 'E' in the second. This corresponds to the grid position '132', which represents the letter 'H'.\n\n3. **EAD:**  'E' is in the first position, 'A' in the second, and 'D' in the third.  This corresponds to the grid position '123', which represents the letter 'A'.\n\n**Finding the Missing Sequence:**\n\n* We have 'E' and 'H' so far, needing the letter to complete the word 'THE'.\n* 'T' is in the third row, second column of our grid. \n* The sequence representing 'T' would be 'FCE' ('F' being in the first position, 'C' in the second, and 'E' in the third to correspond with '321' on the grid).\n\nTherefore, the missing three-letter sequence is 'FCE'.",

Here's what you know about the collection: \n\n* No two rooms share the same combination of artwork types (e.g., if one room has two paintings by male artists, no other room can). \n* Each artwork is by an artist of a different nationality: Italian, French, Dutch, Spanish, or German. \n* In the Renaissance room, both paintings are by Italian artists, and there is a sculpture by a Dutch artist.\n* The Baroque room features a French tapestry.\n* The Impressionist room contains no German art. \n* The Modern room showcases a Spanish painting and a German sculpture. \n* There are more French artworks spread across the gallery than artworks of any other nationality. \n**Question**: Can you determine the nationality of the artist who created the tapestry in the Modern room, and provide the complete arrangement of artwork types and nationalities for each room?\n**Difficulty Level**: 9/10\n",

            "reasoning": "This puzzle requires a multi-layered deduction process using the given clues and the constraint of unique artwork type combinations. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Renaissance Room**\n* We know: Two Italian paintings, one Dutch sculpture. \n* Since combinations can't repeat, the remaining two artworks must be a sculpture and a tapestry, and neither can be Italian or Dutch. \n* Possibilities: (a) Spanish sculpture, German tapestry (b) German sculpture, Spanish tapestry \n\n**Step 2: Baroque Room** \n* We know: French tapestry. \n* To maintain unique combinations, the remaining artworks must include one French piece (either painting or sculpture) and three non-French pieces. \n\n**Step 3: Impressionist Room**\n* We know: No German art. \n* To be unique and considering previous deductions, this room likely has a heavy concentration of either Spanish or Dutch art. \n\n**Step 4: Modern Room** \n* We know: Spanish painting, German sculpture. \n\n**Step 5: Consolidating Information**\n* The high number of French artworks across the gallery, combined with the Baroque room's limitations, suggests the Baroque room must have at least one French painting and one French sculpture. This ensures a higher count of French art compared to other nationalities.\n* This deduction eliminates the possibility of a French tapestry in the Modern room. \n*  Returning to the Renaissance Room possibilities, if the Renaissance room has a German tapestry, it forces the Modern room tapestry to be Spanish. However, this would mean the Impressionist room has no Spanish or Dutch tapestry, making its combination impossible given previous deductions.  \n* Therefore, the Renaissance room MUST have a Spanish sculpture and a German tapestry. This leaves the Modern room tapestry to be Dutch. \n\n**Step 6: Final Arrangement**\n\n* **Renaissance:** Italian Painting, Italian Painting, Dutch Sculpture, Spanish Sculpture, German Tapestry\n* **Baroque:**  French Tapestry, French Painting, French Sculpture, (Non-French Painting/Sculpture), (Non-French Painting/Sculpture)\n* **Impressionist:** This room's arrangement can be deduced based on the remaining nationalities and artwork types, ensuring no repetition of combinations.\n* **Modern:** Spanish Painting, German Sculpture, Dutch Tapestry, (Non-Spanish/German/Dutch Painting), (Non-Spanish/German/Dutch Sculpture)\n\n**Answer:** The artist of the tapestry in the Modern room is Dutch.

Utilizing Item Clues:**\n   * Clue 3 & 5:  The gunshot wasn't in the Library (only manuscripts), meaning the stolen item IS NOT a manuscript. \n   * Clue 4 & 5: Since the Disgruntled Heir can only be in the Grand Gallery or Conservatory, and the stolen item isn't the sculpture or tapestry, they must have stolen an Impressionist Painting from the Grand Gallery. This also means the Disgruntled Heir is the murderer.\n\n**5. Final Deductions:**\n   * Knowing the Disgruntled Heir was in the Grand Gallery, we can deduce the Art Thief was in the Library (as they couldn't be in the Drawing-Room) and stole nothing.\n   * The Rival Collector must then be in the Drawing-Room and stole the tapestry.\n   * This leaves the Mysterious Newcomer in the Conservatory, stealing the sculpture.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n* **Murderer:** The Disgruntled Heir\n* **Location:** The Grand Gallery\n* **Stolen Masterpiece:** An Impressionist Painting \n",
