            "difficulty": "easy",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Understand the relative speed:** Speedy is moving 1 number faster than Shelly every minute (2 numbers per minute - 1 number per minute = 1 number per minute). \n\n2. **Calculate the distance:**  Speedy needs to cover a distance of 3 numbers (from 3 to 12) to overtake Shelly.\n\n3. **Time to overtake:** Since Speedy gains 1 number every minute, it will take him 3 minutes to cover the 3 number distance and overtake Shelly.\n\n**Therefore, it will take Speedy 3 minutes to overtake Shelly.**",

This is equivalent to moving the minute hand forward 30 minutes.\n\n2. **Hour Hand Movement:** The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, meaning it moves 30 degrees every hour. Since the minute hand has moved 30 minutes, the hour hand will also move 30/60 = 1/2 of its hourly movement.  So, the hour hand will move 1/2 * 30 = 15 degrees.\n\n3. **New Position of Hour Hand:** Since the hour hand was initially pointing at 10, moving it 15 degrees clockwise will place it midway between the 10 and the 11.\n\nTherefore, the hour hand will be pointing at the midpoint between the numbers 10 and 11 after the minute hand's rotation.",

Here's how to approach it:\n\n1. **Understanding Clock Angles:**\n   - A clock face is divided into 12 hours, making a full circle of 360 degrees.  Therefore, each hour mark represents 30 degrees (360/12 = 30).\n   - The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, meaning it moves 6 degrees per minute (360/60 = 6).\n   - The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, meaning it moves 30 degrees per hour (360/12 = 30) or 0.5 degrees per minute (30/60 = 0.5).\n\n2. **Setting up the Equation:**\n   - Let 'x' be the number of minutes past 5:00.\n   - The minute hand will be at 6x degrees (6 degrees per minute * x minutes).\n   - The hour hand will be at 150 + 0.5x degrees (150 degrees for the initial 5 hours + 0.5 degrees per minute * x minutes).\n   - We want the difference between these angles to be 120 degrees.\n   - Therefore, our equation is: |150 + 0.5x - 6x| = 120\n\n3. **Solving for x:**\n   -  We have two possibilities, either 150 + 0.5x - 6x = 120 or 150 + 0.5x - 6x = -120.\n   - Solving the first equation: -5.5x = -30 => x = 5.45 (approximately)\n   - Solving the second equation: -5.5x = -270 => x = 49.09 (approximately)\n   - Since we are looking for a time between 5:00 and 6:00, the valid solution is x = 5.45 minutes.\n\n4. **The Answer:**\n   -  Therefore, the hour and minute hands are 120 degrees apart at approximately **5:05 and 27 seconds**.",

            "reasoning": "This problem requires us to think about the geometry of the clock and its shadow, as well as the relationship between the hour and minute hands. Here's how to solve it:\n\n1. **Understanding Clock Geometry:**  A standard clock face is a circle divided into 12 hours, which means each hour mark represents 30 degrees (360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees/hour). The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, meaning it moves 6 degrees every minute (360 degrees / 60 minutes = 6 degrees/minute).\n\n2. **Shadow Length and Angle:**  The length of the shadows of the hour and minute hands is important because it tells us the angle of the sun relative to the clock. The longer the shadow, the lower the sun in the sky.  Since the shadow of the hour hand is shorter than the shadow of the minute hand, we know the sun is higher in the sky when the hour hand is pointing at the time. The angle between the shadows is a result of the relative positions of the hour and minute hands.\n\n3. **Relating Shadow Angle to Time:**  The fact that the minute hand's shadow is 15 degrees behind the hour hand's shadow means that the minute hand is 15 degrees ahead of the hour hand in terms of their positions on the clock face. We need to figure out what time this corresponds to.\n\n4. **Finding the Time:** Let's break down the problem:\n   * The hour hand is 30 degrees ahead of the 12, as its shadow is 30 degrees long. This places the hour hand between the 1 and the 2.  \n   * The minute hand is 15 degrees ahead of the hour hand, which means it's 45 degrees ahead of the 12 (30 + 15 = 45).

Since there are 12 hours on a clock face, each hour mark represents 30 degrees (360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees/hour). A quarter of this distance is 7.5 degrees (30 degrees / 4 = 7.5 degrees). Therefore, the normal hour hand is at 97.5 degrees from the 12 (3 * 30 degrees + 7.5 degrees = 97.5 degrees).\n\n2. **Fast Hour Hand:** The fast hour hand moves twice as fast as the normal hour hand. So, in the same time that the normal hour hand moves 97.5 degrees, the fast hour hand will have moved 195 degrees (97.5 degrees * 2 = 195 degrees).\n\n3. **Angle Calculation:** To find the angle between the two hands, subtract the smaller angle from the larger angle. In this case, the angle between the hands is 97.5 degrees (195 degrees - 97.5 degrees = 97.5 degrees).\n\nTherefore, the angle between the two hour hands at 3:15 PM is **97.5 degrees**.",

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Clock A will complete 5 full rotations of its minute hand every hour (60 minutes / 12 minutes per rotation). \n* Over 24 hours, Clock A will complete 120 full rotations of its minute hand (24 hours * 5 rotations per hour). Since a full rotation of the minute hand represents 1 hour, Clock A will effectively display 12:00 PM after 24 hours.\n\n**2. Analyzing Clock B:**\n* Clock B's hour hand moves counterclockwise at 1 minute per hour. This means it will move 24 minutes in 24 hours.

The angle between them is approximately 40 degrees.\n\n3. **The 180-degree Angle:** For the hands to be 180 degrees apart, the minute hand needs to gain 140 degrees (180 - 40 = 140).  \n\n4. **Calculating Time:** Since the minute hand gains 5.5 degrees per minute, it will take approximately 25.45 minutes to gain 140 degrees (140 / 5.5 = 25.45).  \n\n5. **Final Time:** Adding 25.45 minutes to 4:20 PM, the time will be approximately **4:45:27 PM**. \n\n**Therefore, the time when the hour and minute hands form a 180-degree angle for the first time after 4:20 PM is approximately 4:45:27 PM.**",

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "This problem requires several steps to solve. We need to account for the clock's fast running, the chiming pattern, and the time difference. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate the total time the clock is fast:**\n   - The clock runs 15 seconds fast per hour, so in 9 hours (from 1:00 AM to 10:00 AM), it's fast by 9 hours * 15 seconds/hour = 135 seconds.\n   - Convert this to minutes: 135 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2.25 minutes.\n\n2. **Determine the actual time the clock chimed 10 times:**\n   - The clock shows 10:00 AM, but it's 2.25 minutes fast.  Therefore, the actual time is 9:57:45 AM.\n\n3. **Calculate the actual time 2 hours and 37 minutes ago:**\n   -  Subtract 2 hours from 9:57:45 AM: This gives us 7:57:45 AM.\n   -  Then subtract 37 minutes: 7:57:45 AM - 37 minutes = 7:20:45 AM.\n\n4. **Round to the nearest minute:**\n   - The actual time 2 hours and 37 minutes ago was approximately **7:21 AM**.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Time Calculation:** The problem involves manipulating hours, minutes, and seconds to calculate the time difference accurately.\n* **Clock Discrepancy:** Understanding how a clock's speed affects the actual time is crucial.\n* **Pattern Recognition:** Recognizing the pattern of the chimes helps determine the actual time based on the number of chimes.",

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to break down the problem and find the time on Clock E:\n\n1. **Understand the Time Differences:**\n   * Clock A is 15 minutes ahead of the central clock.\n   * Clock B is 10 minutes behind the central clock.\n   * Clock C is 25 minutes ahead of the central clock.\n   * Clock D gains 3 minutes every hour compared to the central clock.\n   * Clock E loses 4 minutes every hour compared to the central clock.\n\n2. **Focus on Clock E:** We need to determine the time on Clock E when the central clock shows 11:00 AM. Since Clock E runs slower, it will show a time earlier than 11:00 AM.\n\n3. **Calculate the Time Difference for Clock E:**\n   * Clock E loses 4 minutes every hour.  Since it's 11:00 AM, Clock E has been running for 11 hours.  \n   * Therefore, Clock E has lost a total of 11 hours * 4 minutes/hour = 44 minutes.\n\n4. **Subtract the Lost Time from the Central Clock Time:**\n   * The central clock shows 11:00 AM.\n   * Subtract the 44 minutes lost by Clock E: 11:00 AM - 44 minutes = 10:16 AM.\n\n**Therefore, Clock E shows 10:16 AM.**",

A colleague in New York City (EST) needs to join the meeting, but they have a previous commitment that ends at 11:00 AM EST. They need to travel from New York City to London, taking 6 hours of flight time.

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Time Difference:** London is 5 hours ahead of New York City (GMT is 5 hours ahead of EST). This means that 10:00 AM in London is 5:00 AM in New York City.\n\n2. **Arrival Time in London:**  To be on time for the 10:00 AM meeting in London, the colleague needs to arrive in London by 10:00 AM local time.\n\n3. **Departure Time from New York City:** Since the flight takes 6 hours, the colleague needs to depart from New York City 6 hours before 10:00 AM London time, which is 4:00 AM London time.\n\n4. **Departure Time in New York City:**  Converting 4:00 AM London time to New York City time, we subtract 5 hours (the time difference), resulting in 11:00 PM the previous day in New York City.\n\n5. **Latest Departure Time:** The colleague has a commitment that ends at 11:00 AM EST.

Along the way, it stops for a 15-minute break at a station C. Station C is located 3/5 of the total distance between Station A and Station B.  A second train leaves Station B at 11:00 AM and travels at 75 miles per hour towards Station A.  What is the exact time both trains pass each other?  ",
            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "To solve this, we need to determine a few key points:\n\n1. **Distance and Time:**  The first train travels for 2 hours and 15 minutes (145 minutes) from Station A to Station B, with a 15-minute stop at Station C. This means its actual travel time is 130 minutes (145 - 15).\n\n2. **Distance to Station C:** The distance between Station A and Station C is 3/5 of the total distance between Station A and Station B.\n\n3. **Combined Travel Time:** The second train leaves Station B at 11:00 AM, while the first train departs Station A at 10:15 AM, meaning they have a 45-minute time difference in their departure times.\n\n4. **Relative Speed:** Since the trains are traveling towards each other, their speeds are added together.  The combined speed is 60 mph + 75 mph = 135 mph.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n* **Calculate the distance from Station A to Station C:**  Let's assume the total distance between Station A and Station B is 'D'. The distance from Station A to Station C is (3/5) * D.\n\n* **Calculate the distance traveled by the first train before reaching Station C:** The first train travels for 130 minutes, which is equal to 130/60 = 2.17 hours.\n\n* **Find the distance traveled by the first train before reaching Station C:**  Distance = Speed x Time.  The distance traveled by the first train is 60 mph * 2.17 hours = 130.2 miles.\n\n* **Determine if the first train reaches Station C before the second train departs Station B:**  Since the first train reaches Station C before the second train departs Station B, they will pass each other before the second train reaches Station C.\n\n* **Calculate the remaining distance for the first train to travel to Station C:**  The remaining distance is (3/5)D - 130.2 miles.\n\n* **Calculate the time taken for the first train to cover the remaining distance:**  Time = Distance / Speed.  The time taken is ((3/5)D - 130.2 miles) / 60 mph.\n\n* **Calculate the time taken for the second train to cover the same distance:**  Time = Distance / Speed.  The time taken is ((3/5)D - 130.2 miles) / 75 mph.\n\n* **Find the time at which the trains meet:** The trains will meet when the sum of the time taken by the first train to cover the remaining distance and the 45-minute head start of the second train is equal to the time taken by the second train to cover the same distance.\n\n ((3/5)D - 130.2 miles) / 60 mph + 45 minutes = ((3/5)D - 130.2 miles) / 75 mph.\n\n* **Solve for D (total distance between Station A and Station B):**\n\n After solving the above equation, we find the total distance (D) is approximately 225 miles.\n\n* **Calculate the time taken by the second train to reach the point where the trains meet:**  Time = Distance / Speed.  The time taken is ((3/5) * 225 miles - 130.2 miles) / 75 mph = 0.83 hours.\n\n* **Calculate the time at which the trains meet:**  The second train leaves Station B at 11:00 AM, and it takes 0.83 hours (approximately 50 minutes) for the trains to meet. Therefore, they will meet at 11:50 AM.  \n\n**Final Answer: The trains will pass each other at 11:50 AM.**",
