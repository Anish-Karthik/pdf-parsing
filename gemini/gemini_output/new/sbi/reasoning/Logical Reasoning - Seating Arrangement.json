From Clue to Placement:**\n   - **Clue 1:** \"A sits opposite the person who sits to the immediate right of B.\" Let's place B tentatively. Due to the alternating pattern, if B faces inwards, the person to their immediate right would face outwards, and vice-versa. A, being opposite, will have the opposite facing direction. We can represent this as:\n\n     _ _ A \n    /\n    B _\n\n   - **Clue 2:** \"F is not a neighbor of B.\" This means F cannot occupy the two vacant spots beside B. We'll keep this in mind.\n\n   - **Clue 3:** \"D sits two places to the left of E.\"  Let's try placing them.  Remember, 'left' in a circular arrangement is determined by the perspective of someone facing inwards. If D is facing inwards, two places to its left would mean moving two spots counter-clockwise. We need to consider both possibilities of D facing inwards and outwards to see if it contradicts any existing information.

Connect the Clues:**\n* **A to the right of B:** Place them together, leaving space as we don't know yet if it's B-A or A-B.\n* **C two seats from D:** This could be interpreted in two ways: either one seat between them, or with someone in between them.

Then, counting two seats to F's right (remembering outward facing), place G. This segment is now fixed.\n* **H three seats left of B:** This links our segments.

Start Deductions:**\n   - **Amelia & Opposite Tablet:** Place Amelia anywhere on the circle. Since someone opposite her uses a tablet, mark the seat directly across from her as using a tablet.\n   - **Benjamin & Laptop:** Place Benjamin two seats away from Chloe (whose device we don't know yet). Since he's to the right of a laptop user, mark the seat to his immediate left as using a laptop.\n   - **Daniel & Grace:** Place Daniel and Grace two seats apart, with Daniel using a laptop.

With Amelia's opposite seat already assigned a tablet, analyze the remaining possibilities for Chloe and Felix, keeping them apart.\n   - **Notepad User:** With most seats assigned, the remaining individual must be the notepad user. Their position will depend on the previous deductions.\n\n**5.

This gives us two possibilities:\n\n**Possibility 1:**\n```\n      Row 2 (Facing North)  _  _  H  _  I  _\n      Row 1 (Facing South)  A  C  _  _  D  _\n```\n\n**Possibility 2:**\n```\n      Row 2 (Facing North)  _  _  H  _  I  _\n      Row 1 (Facing South)  A  _  D  _  C  _\n```\n\n**Step 4:** Clue 4 tells us K is second to the left of the person opposite F. We don't know F's position yet, so we'll keep this information for later.\n\n**Step 5:** Clue 5 states B sits opposite L, and they are not at the ends. This fits into Possibility 1 and also tells us F must be at the end in Row 1:\n\n```\n      Row 2 (Facing North)  _  L  H  _  I  _\n      Row 1 (Facing South)  A  C  B  _  D  F\n```\n\n**Step 6:** From Clue 5 and the fact that K is second to the left of the person opposite F, we can place K in Row 2:\n\n```\n      Row 2 (Facing North)  _  L  H  K  I  _\n      Row 1 (Facing South)  A  C  B  _  D  F\n```\n\n**Step 7:** Clue 6 tells us E and J are immediate neighbors, but neither is opposite C. This leaves only one place for them in the arrangement:\n\n```\n      Row 2 (Facing North)  _  L  H  K  I  J\n      Row 1 (Facing South)  A  C  B  E  D  F\n```\n\n**Step 8:** The only person left is G, who must occupy the remaining spot:\n\n```\n      Row 2 (Facing North)  G  L  H  K  I  J\n      Row 1 (Facing South)  A  C  B  E  D  F\n```\n\nNow, focusing on the people to D's right (E and F), we see that E sits exactly in the middle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **E**.
