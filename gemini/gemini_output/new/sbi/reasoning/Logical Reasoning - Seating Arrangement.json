For instance, a scenario where Alice and Bob are both selected is highly improbable due to Clue 1.

From Clue to Placement:**\n   - **Clue 1:** \"A sits opposite the person who sits to the immediate right of B.\" Let's place B tentatively. Due to the alternating pattern, if B faces inwards, the person to their immediate right would face outwards, and vice-versa. A, being opposite, will have the opposite facing direction. We can represent this as:\n\n     _ _ A \n    /\n    B _\n\n   - **Clue 2:** \"F is not a neighbor of B.\" This means F cannot occupy the two vacant spots beside B. We'll keep this in mind.\n\n   - **Clue 3:** \"D sits two places to the left of E.\"  Let's try placing them.  Remember, 'left' in a circular arrangement is determined by the perspective of someone facing inwards. If D is facing inwards, two places to its left would mean moving two spots counter-clockwise. We need to consider both possibilities of D facing inwards and outwards to see if it contradicts any existing information.

Alternating Cards:**  The rule about triangular cards means the seating pattern around the table must alternate: circle-triangle-circle-triangle, etc.\n\n**3. Placing Carlos and David:** Carlos (triangle) is to David's right. Because of the alternating pattern, David must be holding a circle card and therefore sits at a corner. There are two possible corner positions for David, let's analyze one:\n\n* **Scenario 1:** Let's say David is at the corner to Bella's immediate right. This forces Carlos into the position to David's right (which is not a corner, fulfilling the rules). \n\n* **Scenario 2:** If David is at the corner to Bella's left, Carlos would have to be at a corner (to David's right), which violates the rules. Therefore, this scenario is incorrect.\n\n**4. Placing Emily:** We know Emily has a triangular card. Since only one spot remains next to Alex and it cannot accommodate a triangular card, Emily cannot be next to Alex. The only other positions left for Emily are the two remaining sides of the table. \n\n**Conclusion:** Emily must be seated on one of the sides of the table, two spaces away from Alex.",

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Visual Representation:**\n   Since we're dealing with a circular arrangement, it's helpful to visualize it. Draw a circle and mark eight spots around it to represent the eight seats.\n\n**2. Placing the Friends:**\n   * **Start with a fixed pair:** The most straightforward clue is that Catherine and David sit opposite each other. Place them arbitrarily across from each other on your circle. \n   * **Branch out:** Now use the clues that branch directly from Catherine and David's positions.  Eric sits two places to David's right. Determine which direction is right from David's perspective (clockwise or counter-clockwise based on your initial placement) and count two spots to place Eric. \n   * **More connections:**  We know Bella sits three places to the right of Adam. Since we don't know their exact positions yet, keep this information in mind but don't place them yet. \n   * **Strategic placement:** Fiona is not a neighbor of Eric or Adam. This negative information helps us narrow down Fiona's possible positions.  Mark the spots next to Eric and Adam as unavailable for Fiona.\n   * **Connecting the dots:** We know George sits to Fiona's immediate right and Heather sits two places to George's left.  Experiment with placing Fiona and George in the remaining spots, considering the restrictions on Fiona's placement. Only one arrangement will allow you to then place Heather two spaces to George's left without conflicting with previously placed individuals. \n   * **Final piece:**  With most of the friends placed, you should now be able to easily fit in Bella and Adam according to the clue that Bella sits three places to Adam's right. \n\n**3. Answering the Question:**\n   The question asks who sits to the immediate right of Catherine. After carefully placing all the friends based on the clues, you should be able to clearly identify the person in that position.\n\n**Therefore, the seating arrangement, solved step-by-step, reveals the answer to who sits to the immediate right of Catherine.**",

You want to visually represent the order and relative sizes of the planets using a diagram.  \n\n**Diagram Instructions:**\n\nYou will use a horizontal line as a baseline. Above this line, you will draw circles representing the planets. The size of each circle should roughly correspond to the planet's equatorial diameter. The planets should be ordered from left to right, starting with the one closest to the sun.  \n\n**Information:**\n\n1.  Earth is larger than Mars but smaller than Venus. \n2.  Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. \n3.  Mercury is the smallest planet. \n4.  Saturn is smaller than Jupiter but larger than Uranus and Neptune. \n5.  Neptune is farther from the sun than Uranus. \n\n**Question:**\n\nIf you were to draw a circle representing Venus, then another representing Uranus, what is the maximum number of planets you could fit between them on the diagram, maintaining the correct order and size representations?",

Since the question asks for the *maximum* number of planets, we can fit both Earth and Mars between Venus and Uranus while maintaining the correct size order. \n\n**Therefore, the maximum number of planets you can fit between Venus and Uranus is 2 (Earth and Mars).**",

This tells us two important things: Blake will occupy either the first or last seat, and Dylan won't be sitting next to him.\n* **Dylan and Emily:** Dylan likes being near Emily. Combining this with the previous deductions, we can infer that Dylan will likely be sitting beside Emily, but not on an edge seat.\n\n**Step 3: Combining Information and Deducing the Arrangement**\n\n1. Since Blake sits on an edge and avoids Dylan, Dylan cannot be in the second seat. This eliminates Alex & Emily taking up seats 1 & 2.\n2.

Since Alex is to Chloe's right, and Chloe sits three seats away from another tablet user (who isn't Henry), we can deduce the pattern: Tablet - _ - _ - Chloe - ... - Alex. \n   -  Clue 3 tells us Blair uses a tablet and is two seats left of Henry.

Place the square accordingly.\n   * **Clue 5:** The star is directly opposite the pentagon. We don't know their exact positions yet, but we know they are opposite each other.\n\n**3. Work with Adjacent Constraints:**\n   * **Clue 3:** The triangle and the pentagon are adjacent.  Keep this pairing in mind as you consider other clues.\n   * **Clue 4:** Neither the triangle nor the pentagon is adjacent to the square. This limits where the triangle-pentagon pair can be placed.\n\n**4. Deduce through Elimination:**\n   * Consider the spaces next to the square. Neither the triangle-pentagon pair nor the octagon (due to Clue 6) can be there. This means only the hexagon can be next to the square.\n   * Because the hexagon is next to the square, the triangle-pentagon pair must be two spaces away from the square (due to Clue 4). There are two possible spots for them.\n   * Remember Clue 5: The star is opposite the pentagon. Only one of the possible triangle-pentagon placements allows the star to be opposite the pentagon without violating Clue 6 (octagon not being next to the heart or star).\n\n**5.

This gives us two possibilities:\n\n**Possibility 1:**\n```\n      Row 2 (Facing North)  _  _  H  _  I  _\n      Row 1 (Facing South)  A  C  _  _  D  _\n```\n\n**Possibility 2:**\n```\n      Row 2 (Facing North)  _  _  H  _  I  _\n      Row 1 (Facing South)  A  _  D  _  C  _\n```\n\n**Step 4:** Clue 4 tells us K is second to the left of the person opposite F. We don't know F's position yet, so we'll keep this information for later.\n\n**Step 5:** Clue 5 states B sits opposite L, and they are not at the ends. This fits into Possibility 1 and also tells us F must be at the end in Row 1:\n\n```\n      Row 2 (Facing North)  _  L  H  _  I  _\n      Row 1 (Facing South)  A  C  B  _  D  F\n```\n\n**Step 6:** From Clue 5 and the fact that K is second to the left of the person opposite F, we can place K in Row 2:\n\n```\n      Row 2 (Facing North)  _  L  H  K  I  _\n      Row 1 (Facing South)  A  C  B  _  D  F\n```\n\n**Step 7:** Clue 6 tells us E and J are immediate neighbors, but neither is opposite C. This leaves only one place for them in the arrangement:\n\n```\n      Row 2 (Facing North)  _  L  H  K  I  J\n      Row 1 (Facing South)  A  C  B  E  D  F\n```\n\n**Step 8:** The only person left is G, who must occupy the remaining spot:\n\n```\n      Row 2 (Facing North)  G  L  H  K  I  J\n      Row 1 (Facing South)  A  C  B  E  D  F\n```\n\nNow, focusing on the people to D's right (E and F), we see that E sits exactly in the middle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **E**.

            "question": "Eight renowned scientists from different fields - Alice (astrophysicist), Brian (biologist), Carol (chemist), David (doctor), Emily (engineer), Felix (physicist), Gina (geologist), and Henry (historian) - are seated around a circular table for a multidisciplinary conference.  They are each seated facing the center of the table.  Deduce their seating arrangement based on the following clues:\n\n1. The biologist is seated directly opposite the historian.\n2. The physicist is seated three seats to the right of the historian.\n3. Neither the doctor nor the engineer is seated adjacent to the physicist.\n4. The chemist is seated two seats to the left of the astrophysicist.\n5. The geologist is not seated adjacent to the historian.\n6. The doctor and the engineer are not seated opposite each other.\n\nQuestion: If the historian is considered to be at the 12 o'clock position on the table, who occupies the 4 o'clock position?",
            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "Let's break down the clues and deduce the seating arrangement step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1: Establishing a Starting Point**\n\nWe are told to consider the historian, Henry, as being at the 12 o'clock position. This gives us a reference point to begin our deductions.\n\n**Step 2:  Using Direct Relationships**\n\n* Clue 1 tells us the biologist (Brian) sits directly opposite the historian (Henry). Therefore, Brian is at the 6 o'clock position.\n* Clue 2 states the physicist (Felix) is three seats to the right of the historian. Counting clockwise, Felix would be at the 3 o'clock position.\n\n**Current Arrangement:**\n\n* 12 o'clock - Henry (Historian)\n* 3 o'clock - Felix (Physicist)\n* 6 o'clock - Brian (Biologist)\n\n**Step 3:  Negative Constraints**\n\n* Clue 3 states neither the doctor (David) nor the engineer (Emily) sits next to the physicist (Felix). This eliminates the 2 o'clock and 4 o'clock positions for both David and Emily.\n* Clue 5 tells us the geologist (Gina) does not sit next to the historian (Henry).  This eliminates the 11 o'clock and 1 o'clock positions for Gina. \n\n**Step 4:  Multi-Step Deductions**\n\n* Clue 4 states the chemist (Carol) is two seats to the left of the astrophysicist (Alice). Let's consider possible positions for Alice and Carol. If Alice were at the 5 o'clock position, Carol would have to be at the 7 o'clock position. However, this would leave no valid position for Gina (the geologist) as she cannot be adjacent to Henry. Therefore, Alice cannot be at 5 o'clock.\n* The only other valid position for Alice is at the 10 o'clock position. This places Carol at the 8 o'clock position, satisfying Clue 4.\n* With the 11 o'clock and 1 o'clock positions eliminated for Gina, she must be at the 9 o'clock position.\n\n**Current Arrangement:**\n\n* 12 o'clock - Henry (Historian)\n* 1 o'clock -  Open\n* 2 o'clock - Open \n* 3 o'clock - Felix (Physicist)\n* 4 o'clock - Open\n* 5 o'clock - Open\n* 6 o'clock - Brian (Biologist)\n* 7 o'clock - Open\n* 8 o'clock - Carol (Chemist)\n* 9 o'clock - Gina (Geologist)\n* 10 o'clock - Alice (Astrophysicist)\n* 11 o'clock - Open \n\n**Step 5: Final Placement**\n\n* Clue 6 states the doctor and engineer are not seated opposite each other. The only remaining positions are 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock, and 7 o'clock.  We need to find two positions that are not directly across from each other. \n* The only valid combination is to place David (doctor) at the 2 o'clock position and Emily (engineer) at the 5 o'clock position. \n\n**Final Arrangement:**\n\n* 12 o'clock - Henry (Historian)\n* 1 o'clock - Open\n* 2 o'clock - David (Doctor) \n* 3 o'clock - Felix (Physicist)\n* 4 o'clock - Open\n* 5 o'clock - Emily (Engineer)\n* 6 o'clock - Brian (Biologist)\n* 7 o'clock - Open\n* 8 o'clock - Carol (Chemist)\n* 9 o'clock - Gina (Geologist)\n* 10 o'clock - Alice (Astrophysicist)\n* 11 o'clock - Open \n\n**Answer:** The 4 o'clock position remains unoccupied.",
