Here's how to break down the reasoning: \n\n**Understanding the Scenario:** The vending machine scenario highlights a key aspect of conditional statements \u2013 they only guarantee an outcome (getting a soda) if a specific condition is met (inserting $1.50).\n\n**Analyzing the Truth Table:**\n* **Row 1 (T, T):**  If you insert $1.50 (P is True) and the machine works as expected, you will get a soda (Q is True). This makes the statement 'P \u2192 Q' True.\n* **Row 2 (T, F):** If you insert $1.50 (P is True) but don't get a soda (Q is False), the vending machine is broken! The statement 'P \u2192 Q' is False because the expected outcome didn't happen.\n* **Row 3 (F, T):** This is where it gets interesting. You didn't insert $1.50 (P is False), but somehow you still got a soda (Q is True). Maybe someone left a free soda!  Importantly, the original statement doesn't say anything about what happens if you *don't* insert money.  Since the condition (inserting money) wasn't met, the statement 'P \u2192 Q' is still considered True \u2013 it hasn't been violated.\n* **Row 4 (F, F):**  You didn't insert $1.50 (P is False), and you didn't get a soda (Q is False). This aligns with the vending machine's rule, so 'P \u2192 Q' is True. \n\n**Completed Truth Table:**\n| P | Q | P \u2192 Q |\n|---|---|---|\n| T | T |  T  |\n| T | F |  F  |\n| F | T |  T  |\n| F | F |  T  |",

This requires understanding that negating an AND statement often involves using OR and NOT operators.\n3. **Truth Table Construction:** Students need to systematically build truth tables for both the original scenario and its negation.\n4. **Comparison and Analysis:** Finally, they must analyze the truth tables to identify the rows where the original statement and its negation have opposite truth values, showcasing a deeper understanding of negation in a practical context.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n**(a) Truth Table for Vault Unlocking:**\n\n| K (Keycard) | C (Code) | Vault Unlocks (K AND C) |\n|---|---|---|\n| True | True | True |\n| True | False | False |\n| False | True | False |\n| False | False | False |\n\n**(b) Negation of the Statement:**\n\nThe original statement is 'K AND C'. The negation is 'NOT (K AND C)' which can also be expressed as 'NOT K OR NOT C' using De Morgan's Law.\n\n**(c) Truth Table for Vault NOT Unlocking:**\n\n| K (Keycard) | C (Code) | NOT K | NOT C | Vault Does NOT Unlock (NOT K OR NOT C)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| True | True | False | False | False |\n| True | False | False | True | True |\n| False | True | True | False | True |\n| False | False | True | True | True |\n\n**(d) Comparison:**\n\nLooking at the rows of both truth tables, we see opposite truth values in the following cases:\n\n* **Row 2 (K = True, C = False):** The vault unlocks when both are true but doesn't unlock when the code is incorrect.\n* **Row 3 (K = False, C = True):** Similar to above, the vault doesn't unlock if the keycard is missing.\n* **Row 4 (K = False, C = False):**  Naturally, the vault doesn't unlock if both the card and code are incorrect.\n\nThis exercise reinforces that the negation of a compound statement flips the truth values, leading to opposite outcomes in the scenarios where the original conditions are not fully met.",

Completing the Truth Table:**\n\nTo determine the truth values for the conclusion ('Philosophers are Writers'), we need to consider each possible combination of truth values for the premises.  Remember, a syllogistic argument is only valid if the conclusion is ALWAYS true when the premises are true.\n\n* **Row 1 (T, T, ?):**  If both premises are true, it's possible that some philosophers are writers, but it's not guaranteed.  We could have a scenario where all the thinkers who are writers are not philosophers. Therefore, this row is not necessarily true (T).\n* **Row 2 (T, F, ?):** If the second premise is false (no thinkers are writers), then the conclusion must also be false. This row is false (F).\n* **Row 3 (F, T, ?):** If the first premise is false, it means there are no philosophers, so the conclusion (that some philosophers are writers) cannot be true. This row is false (F).\n* **Row 4 (F, F, ?):**  Similar to row 3, if there are no philosophers, the conclusion cannot be true. This row is false (F).\n\nThe completed truth table looks like this:\n\n| **Philosophers are Thinkers** | **Thinkers are Writers** | **Philosophers are Writers** |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| T                               | T                           | **F**                            |\n| T                               | F                           | **F**                            |\n| F                               | T                           | **F**                            |\n| F                               | F                           | **F**                            |\n\n**3.

Standard truth tables deal with absolute truth within a given system. They struggle to incorporate exceptions or context-dependent changes.\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is Correct:**\n\nThe correct answer would highlight that while a truth table could verify the initial deduction, it cannot adequately represent the puzzle's complete logic with the added island scenario.  This is because truth tables lack the nuance to handle exceptions and contextual shifts without significant modification.\n\n**Incorrect Options Would Likely Include:**\n\n* Claims that the entire puzzle can be easily modeled (it can't without modifications to the system the truth table represents).\n* Statements that truth tables are entirely useless here (they're useful for the first part). \n* Options suggesting the puzzle is illogical (it's logically sound but highlights the limitations of formal logic on its own). \n",

It uses an intentionally fantastical premise to highlight that the truth of a conditional statement in logic isn't tied to real-world facts or plausibility.\n\nHere's how we break down the solution:\n\n**1. Define the Propositions:**\n   *  **P:** A cat wears a hat.\n   *  **Q:** A cat can speak telepathically to goldfish.\n\n**2. Create the Truth Table Structure:**\n\n| P | Q | P \u2192 Q |\n|---|---|-------|\n| T | T |       |\n| T | F |       |\n| F | T |       |\n| F | F |       |\n\n**3. Evaluate the Conditional (P \u2192 Q):**\n\n* **Row 1 (T, T):** If a cat wearing a hat (T) can indeed speak telepathically to goldfish (T), the statement holds true. So, P \u2192 Q is True. \n* **Row 2 (T, F):** If a cat wearing a hat (T) *cannot* speak telepathically to goldfish (F), the original statement is broken. This makes P \u2192 Q False. \n* **Row 3 (F, T):** This is where it gets interesting. The statement doesn't say *anything* about cats *without* hats.  Maybe they can speak to goldfish, maybe they can't. Since the statement doesn't contradict this possibility, P \u2192 Q is True. This aligns with the idea that a conditional is only False when the antecedent is True, and the consequent is False. \n* **Row 4 (F, F):** Similar to Row 3, the statement doesn't cover cats without hats. Since it doesn't contradict the possibility of a hatless cat being unable to speak to goldfish,  P \u2192 Q is True.\n\n**4.
