Spatial Reasoning - Fitting:**\n   - **Box A:** While you might think you can fit 216 cm\u00b3 / 14.14 cm\u00b3 \u2248 15 chocolates in Box A, the spherical shape limits how closely they pack. You can practically fit only one per corner, totaling 8 chocolates.\n   - **Box B:**  The irregular shape allows for more efficient placement. You need to mentally visualize how the spheres might fit, leaving minimal gaps. This is where the 'tricky' part comes in.\n\n**4. Optimization:**\n   - Through careful arrangement in Box B, it's possible to fit a row of 4 chocolates (7 cm width), stacked in two layers with some careful positioning within the 5 cm height. This allows for 4 * 2 = 8 chocolates.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n   - Surprisingly, BOTH boxes have the same maximum capacity when considering practical sphere packing.
