So, X is a Doctor.\n* The Teacher is married to the Doctor's sister. This means the Teacher is X's brother-in-law. \n* F is the sister-in-law of the Engineer. Since the Teacher is male, F must be married to the other Engineer. \n* A is an Engineer and is to the left of his mother. This implies A's mother is an Engineer too.\n* Since there are two of each profession, and we already have two Engineers (A and A's mother), C and E must be Doctors. \n\n**2. Positioning:**\n\n* B is to the immediate right of his father (X). \n* The Teacher and his wife (Doctor's sister) are at the extreme ends.\n* F is second to the right of D.\n* The two Engineers are together.\n* C is between A and E.\n\n**3. Combining the Clues:**\n\n* Since the Teacher and his wife are at the ends, and B is with his father (X, the Doctor), they must be in the middle. The arrangement could be _T BX _ _ or _ _ XB T_\n*  We know A, an Engineer, is with his mother (also an Engineer).  They must be together in the remaining slots. This gives us  _T BXA _ or _ _ AXB T_\n*  C is between A and E, and E is a Doctor. This means E must be B's father (X) as both are Doctors. The arrangement becomes _T BEAC _ or _ _ CAEB T_\n*  F is second to the right of D, and F is married to an Engineer. This means D must be in the first slot, and F in the third slot to satisfy the condition. The final arrangement becomes DBEACF.\n\n**4. Answering the Question:**\n\n* We need to find who is fourth to the left of E's child. \n* E's child is B.\n* Counting four positions to the left of B, we reach D.\n\nTherefore, D is standing fourth to the left of E's child.
