An aunt is either the sister of one's father or the sister of one's mother. Let's consider both possibilities:\n\n**Possibility 1: R is the sister of T's father**\n\n1. **T's father:**  We don't have a direct symbol for 'father'. However, if we know someone is the mother of T's father, we can deduce that person is T's grandmother.  Let's assume 'X' is T's father, so we need an expression showing someone is the mother of X.  We can represent this as 'Y $ X' (Y is the mother of X). \n2. **R is the sister of X:** This can be represented as 'R @ X'.\n\nCombining both pieces, we get 'Y $ X @ R' which translates to 'Y is the mother of X, and X is the brother of R'. This establishes R as the aunt of T.\n\n**Possibility 2: R is the sister of T's mother**\n\n1. **T's Mother:** Let's say 'Z' is T's mother. This isn't directly given, but we know if someone is the daughter of T's mother, that person is T's sibling. We'll use this later. \n2. **R is the sister of Z:** This can be represented as 'R @ Z'.\n3. **T's Sibling:** Now, we need to link Z to T. We can use the 'daughter' symbol: 'T # Z' (T is the daughter of Z).\n\nCombining, we get 'T # Z @ R' which means 'T is the daughter of Z, and Z is the brother of R'.  However, this means R is T's uncle, not aunt. So, this possibility is incorrect.\n\n**Therefore, the correct expression indicating 'R is the aunt of T' is 'Y $ X @ R'.**",
