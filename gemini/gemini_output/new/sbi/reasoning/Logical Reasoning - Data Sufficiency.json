This discount is 0.10 * $80 = $8.\n4. **Final Price:**  The final price of the jacket after both discounts is $80 - $8 = $72.\n\nTherefore, the final price of the jacket will be $72 if Sarah uses the coupon.",

While it tells us the price difference between the two types of cookies, it does not provide information about the actual prices or the number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold. Therefore, we cannot determine the revenue from each type of cookie.\n* **Statement 2:**  This statement alone is not sufficient. We only know the number of chocolate chip cookies sold, not the number of oatmeal raisin cookies or the prices of either type. We cannot calculate revenue based on this information.\n* **Statements 1 and 2 Together:** This information is sufficient. We know that 60% of the cookies sold are chocolate chip and 40% are oatmeal raisin.  Since we know the number of chocolate chip cookies sold (120), we can calculate the number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold: 120 * (40/60) = 80 oatmeal raisin cookies. Although we don't know the exact prices of the cookies, we know that oatmeal raisin cookies are priced 20% higher than chocolate chip cookies.

            "reasoning": "**Understanding the Problem**\n\n* **Base 4:** A base 4 number system uses only the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3. Each place value represents a power of 4. For example, the number 123 in base 4 is equivalent to (1 * 4^2) + (2 * 4^1) + (3 * 4^0) = 16 + 8 + 3 = 27 in base 10.\n* **Divisibility by 3:** A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements**\n\n*(A)* This statement tells us that the sum of the digits in the base 4 representation of the number is divisible by 3. However, this doesn't directly tell us if the number itself is divisible by 3 in base 10. Consider the base 4 number 111. The sum of its digits (1+1+1) is divisible by 3, but the number 111 in base 4 is equivalent to 21 in base 10, which is not divisible by 3.  Therefore, statement (A) alone is not sufficient.\n\n*(B)* This statement tells us the number is greater than 100 in base 4. This means the number has a hundred's digit (in base 4). Since the hundred's digit represents a multiple of 4^2, which is 16, and 16 is divisible by 3, the number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of the tens and units digits (in base 4) is divisible by 3. However, this information is not provided in the statement. Therefore, statement (B) alone is not sufficient.\n\n*(A) and (B) together:*  If we know both the sum of the digits is divisible by 3 (from statement A) and that the number has a hundred's digit (from statement B), we can conclude that the number is divisible by 3. This is because the hundred's digit is always divisible by 3, and if the sum of the tens and units digits is also divisible by 3, then the entire number is divisible by 3. \n\n**Answer:** Statements (A) and (B) together are sufficient to answer the question.",

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine if either statement alone or both statements together are sufficient to find the maximum number of type A widgets. \n\n **Understanding the problem:** The problem asks for the maximum number of type A widgets the company can produce, given a budget constraint and a total widget production constraint.  The cost of each widget type is given, and we need to determine the number of type A widgets within the constraints. \n\n **Analyzing Statement 1:**\n  Statement 1 tells us that the company wants to produce at least 20 widgets of type B. This sets a lower bound on the production of type B widgets.  We can calculate the cost of producing 20 widgets of type B: 20 widgets * $15/widget = $300.  This leaves $1000 - $300 = $700 remaining in the budget for type A widgets. We can then calculate the maximum number of type A widgets that can be produced with this remaining budget: $700 / $10/widget = 70 widgets. However, since the total number of widgets must be at least 50, and we already have 20 type B widgets, we need to adjust the maximum type A widgets.  We can only produce 50 - 20 = 30 more type A widgets to meet the total widget requirement. \n\n **Therefore, Statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine the maximum number of type A widgets.**\n\n **Analyzing Statement 2:**\n Statement 2 tells us that the company wants to produce at least 30 widgets of type A.

While the probability of this happening decreases with a larger sample, it's not impossible.\n\n**Scenario:** Imagine the company's customer base is evenly split between young customers (age 20-30) and older customers (age 40-50). The initial sample of 100 customers might have, by chance, a higher proportion of younger customers, resulting in an average age of 35. Now, the larger sample of 500 customers could still, by random chance, include a slightly higher proportion of younger customers, even though the population is evenly split.  In this case, the larger sample average might be closer to 35 (the initial sample average) but further away from the true average age of 35 (since the population is evenly split).\n\n**In summary:** While a larger sample size generally improves the accuracy of estimates, it doesn't guarantee that the average of the larger sample will be closer to the true average.

            "question": "A company is considering launching a new product. The marketing team claims that the product will be successful if it is priced below $50. The sales team, however, argues that the product will be more profitable if priced above $50.  They cite a recent study that shows products priced above $50 generally perform better in the market.  Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the sales team's argument? \n\n A) The study did not take into account the specific features and target market of the new product. \n\n B) The company's competitor is planning to launch a similar product at a price below $50. \n\n C) The company has a limited production capacity and cannot produce enough units to meet potential demand if priced above $50. \n\n D) The company's previous successful products were all priced below $50.",
            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "The sales team's argument is based on the study's findings about products priced above $50. To weaken their argument, we need to find a reason why the study might not be relevant to this specific product.  \n\n Option A weakens the sales team's argument because the study did not consider the specific features and target market of the new product. This means that the study's findings might not be applicable to the company's product. The sales team is making a generalization based on a study that may not be relevant to their specific situation.\n\n **Here's why the other options are not as strong:**\n\n* **Option B:**  While a competitor's pricing strategy could influence the company's decisions, it doesn't directly weaken the study's findings about products priced above $50.\n* **Option C:**  Production capacity is a concern for the company, but it doesn't challenge the validity of the study's conclusions about pricing and market performance.\n* **Option D:** Past success with products priced below $50 doesn't necessarily mean that a new product should follow the same strategy.  \n\n **Therefore, Option A is the most effective in weakening the sales team's argument by highlighting the potential irrelevance of the study to the specific product.**",
