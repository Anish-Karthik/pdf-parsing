            "reasoning": "**Understanding the Problem**\n\n* **Base 4:** A base 4 number system uses only the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3. Each place value represents a power of 4. For example, the number 123 in base 4 is equivalent to (1 * 4^2) + (2 * 4^1) + (3 * 4^0) = 16 + 8 + 3 = 27 in base 10.\n* **Divisibility by 3:** A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements**\n\n*(A)* This statement tells us that the sum of the digits in the base 4 representation of the number is divisible by 3. However, this doesn't directly tell us if the number itself is divisible by 3 in base 10. Consider the base 4 number 111. The sum of its digits (1+1+1) is divisible by 3, but the number 111 in base 4 is equivalent to 21 in base 10, which is not divisible by 3.  Therefore, statement (A) alone is not sufficient.\n\n*(B)* This statement tells us the number is greater than 100 in base 4. This means the number has a hundred's digit (in base 4). Since the hundred's digit represents a multiple of 4^2, which is 16, and 16 is divisible by 3, the number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of the tens and units digits (in base 4) is divisible by 3. However, this information is not provided in the statement. Therefore, statement (B) alone is not sufficient.\n\n*(A) and (B) together:*  If we know both the sum of the digits is divisible by 3 (from statement A) and that the number has a hundred's digit (from statement B), we can conclude that the number is divisible by 3. This is because the hundred's digit is always divisible by 3, and if the sum of the tens and units digits is also divisible by 3, then the entire number is divisible by 3. \n\n**Answer:** Statements (A) and (B) together are sufficient to answer the question.",

For example, an experienced employee completes 1/10th of the project in a day.\n* **Combined Work Rate:** When multiple people work together, their work rates add up.\n\n**Setting up the Problem:**\n\nLet:\n*  'x' be the number of experienced employees hired.\n\n* **Work Rate of Experienced Employees:**  x/10 (since each experienced employee completes 1/10th of the project per day)\n* **Work Rate of Trainees:** (20 - x)/20 (since the remaining employees are trainees)\n\n**Solving for 'x':**\n\n* **Combined Work Rate:**  (x/10) + ((20 - x)/20) = 1/12 (since the project needs to be completed in 12 days)\n* **Simplifying the Equation:**  (2x + 20 - x) / 20 = 1/12\n* **Further Simplification:** (x + 20) / 20 = 1/12\n* **Cross-Multiplication:** 12x + 240 = 20\n* **Solving for 'x':** 12x = -220 => x = -18.33\n\n**Interpreting the Solution:**\n\nThe negative result indicates that it's not possible to complete the project in 12 days with only experienced employees and trainees.

The cost of each widget type is given, and we need to determine the number of type A widgets within the constraints. \n\n **Analyzing Statement 1:**\n  Statement 1 tells us that the company wants to produce at least 20 widgets of type B. This sets a lower bound on the production of type B widgets.  We can calculate the cost of producing 20 widgets of type B: 20 widgets * $15/widget = $300.  This leaves $1000 - $300 = $700 remaining in the budget for type A widgets. We can then calculate the maximum number of type A widgets that can be produced with this remaining budget: $700 / $10/widget = 70 widgets. However, since the total number of widgets must be at least 50, and we already have 20 type B widgets, we need to adjust the maximum type A widgets.  We can only produce 50 - 20 = 30 more type A widgets to meet the total widget requirement. \n\n **Therefore, Statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine the maximum number of type A widgets.**\n\n **Analyzing Statement 2:**\n Statement 2 tells us that the company wants to produce at least 30 widgets of type A.

This statement is crucial because it introduces a new constraint that significantly impacts the possible seating arrangements.\n\n**Combining the Statements:**  If Alex is sitting next to Brian (as per Statement 1), then Carol's preference cannot be satisfied.

Here's how to break it down:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe need to determine if they can complete Route A in 5 hours or less. To do this, we need to know the distance of Route A.  We are given information about the relative lengths of the routes and the speed limits, but we need to consider if this information is sufficient to determine the distance of Route A.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\n* **Statement 1:**  Route A is 50 miles longer than Route B. This statement alone is insufficient. We don't know the actual distance of either route, so we can't calculate the travel time on Route A.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Route B has a speed limit of 55 mph.  This statement alone is insufficient. We don't know the length of Route B, so we can't calculate the travel time on Route A.\n\n**Combining the Statements:**\n\nEven when we combine both statements, we still don't have enough information to determine the distance of Route A.  While we know the speed limit on both routes and the relative lengths, we need an actual distance for either Route A or Route B to calculate the travel time on Route A.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nNeither statement alone, nor both statements together, are sufficient to determine if they can complete the trip in 5 hours or less if they choose Route A.\n\n**Answer:**  The answer is **(E) Neither statement alone is sufficient, and the two statements together are not sufficient.**",

Let's break it down:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\nWe have three sets: students who use bicycles (B), cars (C), and public transportation (P). We need to find the number of students who use *only* bicycles (B only). \n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\n* **Statement 1:**  More than half of the students use a bicycle, meaning more than 75 students use bicycles.

We can't definitively determine the number of students who use only bicycles because of the following:\n\n* **Multiple Possibilities:** Even though we know the total number of students (150) and the sizes of sets C and P, there are multiple ways to arrange the remaining students within the 'B only' and other overlapping regions of the Venn diagram.

We need more specific information about the size of the 'B only' set or the size of the other overlapping regions of the Venn diagram to arrive at a definite answer.\n\n**Teaching Point:**\nThis problem highlights the importance of recognizing when data sufficiency questions lack sufficient information to reach a definitive conclusion.

Here's why:\n\n1. **Sampling Bias:** If the initial sample of 100 customers was not truly representative of the company's entire customer base, then even a larger sample may perpetuate the bias. For example, if the initial sample was heavily skewed towards younger customers, the larger sample might also overrepresent younger customers, leading to an average age still lower than the true average.\n\n2. **Randomness:** Even with a larger sample, there's always a chance that the sample might randomly include a disproportionate number of customers from a specific age group. While the probability of this happening decreases with a larger sample, it's not impossible.\n\n**Scenario:** Imagine the company's customer base is evenly split between young customers (age 20-30) and older customers (age 40-50). The initial sample of 100 customers might have, by chance, a higher proportion of younger customers, resulting in an average age of 35. Now, the larger sample of 500 customers could still, by random chance, include a slightly higher proportion of younger customers, even though the population is evenly split.  In this case, the larger sample average might be closer to 35 (the initial sample average) but further away from the true average age of 35 (since the population is evenly split).\n\n**In summary:** While a larger sample size generally improves the accuracy of estimates, it doesn't guarantee that the average of the larger sample will be closer to the true average.

Here's how to solve it:\n\n1. **Finding the number of vanilla cakes:**\n   - If 70% of the cakes are chocolate, then 100% - 70% = 30% of the cakes are vanilla.\n   - We know 420 chocolate cakes represent 70% of the total cakes.  To find the number of vanilla cakes, we can set up a proportion:\n     (70 cakes / 100% ) = (420 chocolate cakes / x%)\n     - Solving for x, we get x = 600%  This means 420 chocolate cakes represent 600% of the vanilla cakes.\n     - Since we know 30% of the cakes are vanilla, we can calculate the number of vanilla cakes by dividing the total number of cakes (600%) by 30%:\n       (600% / 30%) * 1 vanilla cake = 20 vanilla cakes\n\n2. **Finding the ratio of chocolate to vanilla:**\n   - The ratio of chocolate cakes to vanilla cakes is 420 : 20.

This is greater than the actual profit, so we know the bakery must have sold some vanilla cakes. \n\n3. **Eliminate impossible scenarios:** If the bakery sold all 100 cakes as vanilla, the profit would be $300 (100 cakes * $3/cake). This is less than the actual profit.

If the bakery sold 50 chocolate cakes, the profit from them would be $250 (50 cakes * $5/cake). This leaves $130 to be made from vanilla cakes, which would require selling 43.33 vanilla cakes (approximately).  This isn't possible since you can't sell a fraction of a cake.  Since we need to reduce the number of chocolate cakes to get a whole number of vanilla cakes, we can further reduce the number of chocolate cakes to 40.

Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the sales team's argument? \n\n A) The study did not take into account the specific features and target market of the new product. \n\n B) The company's competitor is planning to launch a similar product at a price below $50. \n\n C) The company has a limited production capacity and cannot produce enough units to meet potential demand if priced above $50. \n\n D) The company's previous successful products were all priced below $50.",
            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "The sales team's argument is based on the study's findings about products priced above $50. To weaken their argument, we need to find a reason why the study might not be relevant to this specific product.  \n\n Option A weakens the sales team's argument because the study did not consider the specific features and target market of the new product. This means that the study's findings might not be applicable to the company's product. The sales team is making a generalization based on a study that may not be relevant to their specific situation.\n\n **Here's why the other options are not as strong:**\n\n* **Option B:**  While a competitor's pricing strategy could influence the company's decisions, it doesn't directly weaken the study's findings about products priced above $50.\n* **Option C:**  Production capacity is a concern for the company, but it doesn't challenge the validity of the study's conclusions about pricing and market performance.\n* **Option D:** Past success with products priced below $50 doesn't necessarily mean that a new product should follow the same strategy.  \n\n **Therefore, Option A is the most effective in weakening the sales team's argument by highlighting the potential irrelevance of the study to the specific product.**",

            "question": "A certain number, when expressed in base 7, is a three-digit number. If the digits are reversed, the resulting number is 1013 greater than the original number. If the middle digit of the original number is 4, what is the sum of the digits of the original number in base 7?",
            "difficulty": "very tricky 8/10",
            "reasoning": "Let the original number in base 7 be represented as abc, where a, b, and c are the digits.  The problem states that b = 4.  We can express the original number and the reversed number in base 10:\n\n* Original number (base 10): a * 7^2 + 4 * 7^1 + c * 7^0 = 49a + 28 + c\n* Reversed number (base 10): c * 7^2 + 4 * 7^1 + a * 7^0 = 49c + 28 + a\n\nThe problem states that the reversed number is 1013 greater than the original number, so we can set up an equation:\n\n49c + 28 + a = 49a + 28 + c + 1013\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n48c - 48a = 1013\n\nDividing both sides by 48, we get:\n\nc - a = 21\n\nSince a and c are digits in base 7, they must be between 0 and 6. The only solution that satisfies the equation c - a = 21 is if c = 6 and a = -15. However, a cannot be negative. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem. It is impossible for the reversed number to be 1013 greater than the original number if the middle digit is 4.",
