            "reasoning": "This question tests the ability to identify multiple patterns within a single alphanumeric series.\n\n1. **Letter Pattern:** The series follows a simple alphabetical order, skipping two letters with each step (A, D, G, ...).\n\n2. **Number Pattern:**  The numbers increase sequentially, but also follow a pattern related to the position of the letter in the alphabet.  Notice the following:\n\n* A is the 1st letter, and the number is 1\n* D is the 4th letter, and the number is 4\n* G is the 7th letter, and the number is 7\n\nTherefore, the number corresponds to the position of the letter in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Letter Shift:**  The letter positions shift within the series.  Notice:\n\n* A is the first letter\n* D is the fourth letter\n* G is the seventh letter\n\nThis pattern creates a shifting sequence of +3 positions for the letters.\n\n4. **Combining the Patterns:**  To find the next element, we need to apply all the identified patterns:\n\n* **Letter:** The next letter in the sequence after G is J (skipping 2 letters).\n* **Number:**  Since J is the 10th letter, the number should be 10.\n* **Letter Shift:**  J should be shifted 3 positions forward. \n\nTherefore, the next element in the series is **J10K11L12**.\n\nThis type of question highlights the importance of breaking down complex patterns into smaller, easier-to-understand components.",

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "This question challenges your ability to identify numerical patterns within an alphanumeric series. While the series includes both letters and numbers, the prompt instructs us to focus on the even numbers.  Here's how to break down the solution:\n\n1. **Identify the numerical terms:**  Within the series, the numbers are: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. \n\n2. **Understand even numbers:** Even numbers are divisible by 2. None of the numbers identified in the series (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) are divisible by 2. \n\n3. **Deduce the answer:** The question asks for an even number. However, based on our analysis, there are no even numbers present in the series. This means that the correct answer is not a number, but rather a term that is not a number.  Therefore, the correct answer would be a letter from the series, as the prompt does not specify that the even number should be a numerical value.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The question is tricky because it requires you to not only recognize the numbers but also understand that there might not be a direct answer within the series. You need to apply deductive reasoning to understand the question's limitations. ",

            "difficulty": "very tricky 8/10",
            "reasoning": "This question presents a deceptive pattern that requires careful observation. At first glance, it seems the series simply alternates between letters and numbers. However, a deeper analysis reveals a more intricate pattern.  \n\n Observe that each letter in the sequence follows the alphabetical order, starting with A and increasing incrementally. This appears to be a straightforward element of the series. However, the number sequence doesn't increase in a linear fashion; rather, it appears to follow a pattern where the difference between consecutive numbers decreases. This pattern can be observed as follows: \n\n * The difference between 1 and 2 is 1. \n * The difference between 2 and 3 is 1. \n * The difference between 3 and 4 is 1. \n * The difference between 4 and 5 is 1. \n * The difference between 5 and 6 is 1. \n * The difference between 6 and 7 is 1. \n\n  This pattern of 1-unit differences remains consistent until the final term, **G7**. The issue lies in the number '7', which disrupts the established pattern.  To maintain the established pattern, **G7** should be **G8**. \n\n Therefore, **G7** is the incorrect term in the series.\n\n **Explanation Breakdown** \n\n 1. **Identify the basic pattern:**  The series appears to alternate between letters and numbers. \n 2. **Look for deeper patterns:** Analyze the individual letter and number sequences for consistent patterns. \n 3. **Identify the break:** Determine the element that doesn't fit the established pattern. \n 4. **Correct the inconsistency:**  Identify the correct term based on the established patterns. \n\n By following this methodical approach, one can effectively decipher even the most complex alphanumeric series questions.",
