Calculate the work done by Pipe A in the first 4 hours:**\n\n* Pipe A fills the tank in 12 hours, so in 1 hour, it fills 1/12 of the tank.\n* In 4 hours, Pipe A would have filled (1/12) * 4 = 1/3 of the tank.\n\n**2. Calculate the remaining part of the tank:**\n\n* Since 1/3 of the tank is filled, the remaining part is 1 - (1/3) = 2/3 of the tank.\n\n**3. Calculate the combined work rate of Pipe A and Pipe B:**\n\n* Pipe B fills the tank in 18 hours, meaning it fills 1/18 of the tank in 1 hour.\n* Together, Pipe A and Pipe B fill (1/12) + (1/18) = 5/36 of the tank in 1 hour.\n\n**4. Calculate the time taken to fill the remaining tank:**\n\n* Let 't' be the time taken to fill the remaining 2/3 of the tank.\n* Using the work-time relationship, we get (5/36) * t = 2/3\n* Solving for 't', we get t = (2/3) * (36/5) = 4.8 hours\n\n**5. Calculate the total time taken:**\n\n* The total time taken to fill the tank is 4 hours (Pipe A alone) + 4.8 hours (Pipe A and B together) = 8.8 hours\n\nTherefore, the shortest time in which the tank can be filled completely is **8.8 hours**.",

Determine the cupcakes frosted by the new baker:** \n\n   * The new baker frosted 225 cupcakes (total) - 60t cupcakes (by the experienced team) = 225 - 60t cupcakes.\n\n**4.  Express the new baker's work rate:**\n\n   * The new baker's work rate is (225 - 60t cupcakes) / 't' hours\n\n**5.  Assume all bakers work at the same rate:**\n\n   * Since we're aiming for a medium difficulty, let's assume the new baker integrates seamlessly and works at the same rate as the experienced bakers (this is not stated explicitly, but it simplifies the problem). \n   * This means the new baker also frosts at a rate of 60 cupcakes / 5 bakers = 12 cupcakes per hour.\n\n**6. Set up an equation and solve for 't':**\n\n   * We know the new baker frosted 225 - 60t cupcakes at a rate of 12 cupcakes per hour:  \n     (225 - 60t) / t = 12\n   * Multiply both sides by 't':  225 - 60t = 12t\n   * Add 60t to both sides: 225 = 72t\n   * Divide both sides by 72: t = 3.125 hours\n\n**Answer:** It took the team of 5 bakers 3.125 hours to frost and decorate the 225 cupcakes.",
