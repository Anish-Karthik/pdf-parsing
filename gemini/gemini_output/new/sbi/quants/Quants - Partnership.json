Here's why:\n\n* **Silent Partner:** Alex is explicitly referred to as a silent partner, meaning he doesn't participate in the daily operations or decision-making of the business.\n* **Investment Only:** While Alex contributes capital ($10,000), his role is limited to that of an investor. He doesn't actively contribute to the business's operations like Ben and Charlie.\n* **Profit Sharing:** Despite not being actively involved, Alex still receives a share of the profits (equal to Charlie's), indicating his stake in the partnership.\n\nTherefore, Alex's lack of visible involvement despite being a financial partner and profit sharer makes him the hidden partner.",

Calculate Z's Capital Investment:** \n\n* Z acquires a 25% interest in the total capital after admission.\n* Let Total Capital after Z's admission = TC\n* Z's Capital (25% of TC) = $300,000 - Goodwill \n* 0.25 * TC = $300,000 - Goodwill\n\n**2. Calculate Total Capital and Goodwill:**\n\n* Total Capital (TC) = X's Capital + Y's Capital + Z's Capital\n* TC = $250,000 + $180,000 + ($300,000 - Goodwill)\n* TC = $730,000 - Goodwill\n\n* Substitute TC in the equation from step 1:\n* 0.25 * ($730,000 - Goodwill) = $300,000 - Goodwill\n* $182,500 - 0.25Goodwill = $300,000 - Goodwill\n* 0.75Goodwill = $117,500\n* **Goodwill = $156,666.67**\n\n**3. Calculate Z's Capital:**\n\n* Z's Capital = $300,000 (contribution) - $156,666.67 (Goodwill) = $143,333.33\n\n**4. Calculate New Profit Sharing Ratio:**\n\n* Total Capital after Z's admission = $250,000 + $180,000 + $143,333.33 = $573,333.33\n* X's New Ratio = $250,000 / $573,333.33 = 0.436 (approx)\n* Y's New Ratio = $180,000 / $573,333.33 = 0.314 (approx)\n* Z's New Ratio = $143,333.33 / $573,333.33 = 0.250 (as agreed)\n\n* To express the ratio in whole numbers, find the least common multiple of the decimals. The new profit-sharing ratio is approximately **22:16:12**.\n\nTherefore, the goodwill recognized upon Z's admission is **$156,666.67**, and the new profit-sharing ratio for X, Y, and Z is **22:16:12**.",

This loan must be repaid before the final distribution of assets, impacting Blair's overall settlement.\n3. **Unrealized Gain:** The $20,000 unrealized gain from the asset revaluation needs to be accounted for and distributed according to the profit-sharing ratio, further complicating the settlement.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Capital:**\n* Total Capital = Alex's Capital + Blair's Capital + Chloe's Capital\n* Total Capital = $60,000 + $80,000 + $40,000 = $180,000\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Profit Share Ratio:**\n* Total Ratio = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9\n* Alex's Share = (4/9) * Profit\n* Blair's Share = (3/9) * Profit\n* Chloe's Share = (2/9) * Profit\n\n**Step 3: Distribute the Unrealized Gain:**\n* Alex's Share of Gain = (4/9) * $20,000 = $8,888.89 (rounded to two decimal places)\n* Blair's Share of Gain = (3/9) * $20,000 = $6,666.67 (rounded to two decimal places)\n* Chloe's Share of Gain = (2/9) * $20,000 = $4,444.44 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n**Step 4: Adjust Capital Accounts for Gain:**\n* Alex's Adjusted Capital = $60,000 + $8,888.89 = $68,888.89\n* Blair's Adjusted Capital = $80,000 + $6,666.67 = $86,666.67\n* Chloe's Adjusted Capital = $40,000 + $4,444.44 = $44,444.44\n\n**Step 5: Account for Liabilities and Loan:**\n* Remaining Assets = $250,000 (Total Assets) - $30,000 (Liabilities) = $220,000\n* Remaining Assets after Loan Repayment = $220,000 - $15,000 (Blair's Loan) = $205,000\n\n**Step 6: Calculate and Distribute Remaining Assets based on Adjusted Capital Ratios:**\n* Total Adjusted Capital = $68,888.89 + $86,666.67 + $44,444.44 = $200,000\n* Alex's Final Distribution = ($68,888.89 / $200,000) * $205,000 = $70,416.67 (rounded to two decimal places)\n* Blair's Final Distribution = ($86,666.67 / $200,000) * $205,000 + $15,000 (Loan Repayment) = $104,583.33 (rounded to two decimal places)\n* Chloe's Final Distribution = ($44,444.44 / $200,000) * $205,000 = $45,000\n\n**Therefore:**\n* Alex receives a final distribution of $70,416.67.\n* Blair receives a final distribution of $104,583.33 (including loan repayment).\n* Chloe receives a final distribution of $45,000. \n",
