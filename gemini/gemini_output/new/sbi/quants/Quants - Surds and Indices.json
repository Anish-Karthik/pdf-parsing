This represents a real-world scenario where we want the longest path within a limited rectangular area.\n\n2. **Applying the Constraint:**  To maximize \u221a(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2), we need to maximize (l\u00b2 + w\u00b2).  Since l + w < 6, we can consider the extreme case where l + w = 6. \n\n3. **Maximizing the Expression:** Notice that (l\u00b2 + w\u00b2) resembles the square of the hypotenuse in the Pythagorean theorem. The hypotenuse is maximized when l = w (the rectangle becomes a square).\n\n4. **Solving for l and w:** If l + w = 6 and l = w, then l = w = 3.\n\n5. **Calculating the Maximum Path Length:** Substitute l = 3 and w = 3 into \u221a(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2) to get \u221a(3\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a18 = 3\u221a2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible length of the diagonal path is 3\u221a2 meters. \n\n## Options and Correct Answer:\n\nHere are some options for the answer, with the correct option highlighted:\n\n a) 6\n b) 6\u221a2\n **c) 3\u221a2** \n d) 9 ",
