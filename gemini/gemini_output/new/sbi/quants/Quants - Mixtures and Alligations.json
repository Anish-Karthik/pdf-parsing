Understand the Problem:**\nThe painter wants to dilute a concentrated blue paint solution (30%) by adding a weaker one (15%).  He has a target concentration range (20% - 25%) and needs a minimum volume (40 liters).\n\n**2.  Set up Variables:**\n* Let 'x' be the amount (in liters) of the 15% blue paint solution the painter needs to add.\n\n**3.  Formulate Equations:**\n* **Total Volume:** 25 + x \u2265 40 (He needs at least 40 liters)\n* **Blue Paint Concentration:**  The total amount of blue paint in the final mixture should be between 20% and 25% of the total volume. We can express this mathematically as:\n    * 0.20 (25 + x) \u2264 (0.30 * 25) + (0.15 * x)  (20% concentration)\n    * 0.25 (25 + x) \u2265 (0.30 * 25) + (0.15 * x)  (25% concentration)\n\n**4.

Combine the Results:**\n* We need to find the minimum amount of the 15% solution, so we look for the smallest possible value of 'x'. \n* From the total volume constraint, x \u2265 15 liters\n* From the concentration constraints,  12.5 liters \u2264 x \u2264 50 liters\n* Combining these, the minimum value of x that satisfies all conditions is x = 15 liters\n\n**Answer:** The painter needs to add a minimum of 15 liters of the 15% blue paint solution.",

            "reasoning": "## Reasoning: \n\nThis question falls under the 'Basic Concepts: Mixture, Alligation, Concentration' subtopic as it involves finding the ratio of mixing two components with different prices to achieve a desired mixture price and then calculating the selling price based on a desired profit margin.\n\n**Step 1: Finding the Mixing Ratio**\n\nWe can use alligation to find the ratio. \n*  Draw a simple diagram with the prices of the premium blend ($12), standard blend ($8), and the desired blend ($11).\n*  Calculate the differences between the desired price and the individual blend prices. \n*  The difference between the desired price ($11) and the standard blend price ($8) is $3. This represents the part of the premium blend in the mixture.\n*  The difference between the premium blend price ($12) and the desired price ($11) is $1. This represents the part of the standard blend in the mixture.\n\n Therefore, the mixing ratio is **3:1**, implying 3 parts of the premium blend should be mixed with 1 part of the standard blend. \n\n**Step 2: Calculating the Cost Price of the Special Blend**\n\n* Let's assume the merchant mixes 3 kg of premium blend and 1 kg of the standard blend (based on the 3:1 ratio). \n* The cost of 3 kg of the premium blend is 3 kg * $12/kg = $36\n* The cost of 1 kg of the standard blend is 1 kg * $8/kg = $8\n* The total cost of the 4 kg special blend is $36 + $8 = $44\n* The cost price of the special blend per kg is $44 / 4 kg = $11/kg\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Selling Price for 20% Profit**\n\n* The desired profit is 20% of the cost price, which is 0.20 * $11 = $2.20\n* Therefore, the selling price per kg should be $11 (cost price) + $2.20 (profit) = $13.20\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe merchant should mix the premium and standard blends in a ratio of **3:1**. To achieve a 20% profit, he should sell the special blend at **$13.20 per kg**.",

The 18K gold contains 75% pure gold, the 22K gold contains 91.66% pure gold, and the 24K gold is 100% pure. He needs to create 20 grams of a 21K gold alloy, which contains 87.5% pure gold. Additionally, he wants to use twice as much 18K gold as 24K gold in the mixture.  What is the ratio of the weights of the 18K, 22K, and 24K gold he needs to use, expressed in its simplest form?",
            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "This question involves the Alligation Rule but with an added layer of complexity. Here's how to solve it:\n\n**1. Set up the Alligation Diagram:**\n\n* We have three gold types (18K, 22K, 24K) and need to find the ratio for a 21K alloy.\n* Place the gold purity percentages (as decimals) in a vertical line, with the desired alloy (21K - 0.875) in the middle:\n\n```\n0.75 (18K)  \n        \\     \n         0.875 (21K)\n        /     \n0.9166 (22K)\n        \\     \n         0.875 (21K)\n        /     \n1.000 (24K) \n```\n\n**2. Calculate Differences and Find the Initial Ratios:**\n\n* Find the absolute difference between each gold type and the target alloy (21K):\n    * |0.75 - 0.875| = 0.125\n    * |0.9166 - 0.875| = 0.0416\n    * |1.000 - 0.875| = 0.125 \n* These differences represent the parts needed for each gold type to achieve the desired purity. The initial ratio is: 0.125 : 0.0416 : 0.125 \n\n**3.  Incorporate the Additional Constraint:**\n\n* The problem states the jeweler wants to use twice as much 18K gold as 24K gold. \n* Since the initial ratio for 18K and 24K is 0.125 : 0.125 (which simplifies to 1:1), we need to adjust the 18K portion to be double that of the 24K portion.\n\n**4. Determine the Final Ratio:**\n\n* To make the 18K portion twice the 24K portion while maintaining the initial ratio between 22K and 24K, we can modify the ratio as follows:\n    *  (0.125 * 2) : 0.0416 : 0.125 = 0.25 : 0.0416 : 0.125\n\n**5. Simplify the Ratio:**\n\n* To express the ratio in its simplest whole number form, we can multiply all parts by a common factor to eliminate decimals. In this case, multiplying by 12000 gives us:\n    *  0.25 * 12000 : 0.0416 * 12000 : 0.125 * 12000\n    *  3000 : 500 : 1500 \n* This ratio can be further simplified by dividing by the greatest common factor (500):\n    *  6 : 1 : 3\n\n**Therefore, the jeweler should mix the 18K, 22K, and 24K gold in the ratio of 6:1:3 to create the desired 21K gold alloy while meeting the given constraints.**",

            "reasoning": "## Reasoning: \n\nThis problem utilizes the principles of graphical representation of mixtures and alligations. Here's how to solve it step-by-step: \n\n1. **Understanding the Graph:** The graph plots concentration against cost. The position of each oil (Rose and Jasmine) reflects its concentration and cost per ounce. The line segment RJ represents all possible blends of these two oils. \n\n2. **Target Blend:** The point B(40, 30) on line segment RJ represents our target blend. Its position indicates the desired concentration (40%) and cost ($30/ounce). \n\n3. **Ratio from Distances:** The key lies in understanding that the ratio of Rose oil to Jasmine oil is inversely proportional to the ratio of the distances between point B and the points representing the individual oils on the graph (R and J).  This is based on the lever principle often used in alligation calculations.\n\n4. **Calculating Distances:** \n    * Distance RB (horizontal distance between points R and B):  |60 - 40| = 20 units\n    * Distance BJ (horizontal distance between points B and J): |40 - 30| = 10 units \n\n5. **The Ratio:** \n    * Since the ratio of oils is inversely proportional to the distances, the ratio of Rose oil to Jasmine oil is BJ:RB = 10:20, which simplifies to 1:2. \n\n**Therefore, the perfume maker should use a ratio of 1:2 for Rose oil to Jasmine oil to achieve the desired fragrance blend.**",
