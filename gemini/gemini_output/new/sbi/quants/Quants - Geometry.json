This line is the perpendicular bisector of PQ, and it intersects PQ at its midpoint, which we'll label as M.\n\n2. **Construct the square's sides:** \n   - Since the diagonals of a square are equal and bisect each other at right angles, PM and QM are equal to half the length of the square's diagonal.\n   - Keep the compass radius the same as in step 1.\n   - Place the compass point on M and draw a circle.

Understanding the Problem:** We need to draw a line from point P that touches the circle at exactly one point (tangent) using the fact that angles in semicircles are right angles.\n\n**2. Connecting to the Theorem:**  The key is to realize that if we can find a diameter of the circle where the endpoints subtend a right angle at point P, then a line from P to either endpoint of that diameter will be our desired tangent. \n\n**3. Construction Steps:**\n   * **Step 1:**  Draw line segment OP. \n   * **Step 2:**  Find the midpoint of OP (let's call it M) using the standard perpendicular bisector construction. This midpoint will be the center of our desired semicircle.\n   * **Step 3:** With M as the center and MO (or MP, they are equal) as the radius, draw a circle. This circle will intersect the original circle at two points (let's call them A and B).\n   * **Step 4:** Draw line segments PA and PB.  \n\n**4. Justification:**\n   * Triangle APB is a right triangle (angle APB is 90 degrees) because it's inscribed in a semicircle (our constructed circle) with AB as the diameter.\n   * Since APB is a right triangle, and AP is a radius of the original circle, by the converse of the tangent-radius theorem, line PA is tangent to the original circle at point A.\n   * Similarly, line PB is tangent to the original circle at point B. \n\n**Therefore, we have successfully constructed two tangent lines from point P to the given circle by cleverly applying the inscribed angle theorem.**",

Our goal is to find the area of this smaller triangle.\n\n**2. Key Geometric Concepts**\n* **Inscribed Angles:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n* **Central Angles:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.\n* **Angle Bisector Theorem:**  An angle bisector in a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.\n* **Area of a Triangle:**  (1/2) * base * height\n\n**3.  Solution**\n* **Finding the Circle's Radius:**  Since angle AOC is a central angle measuring 120 degrees and minor arc AC has length 8\u03c0, we can find the circle's radius (r). The circumference of the whole circle is 2\u03c0r, and the arc AC represents (120/360) = 1/3 of the circumference. Therefore:\n   (1/3) * 2\u03c0r = 8\u03c0\n    r = 12\n* **Finding AB and BC:** Angle ABC is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AC, so angle ABC = 120/2 = 60 degrees.  Similarly, angle BAC = 60 degrees.  Therefore, triangle ABC is equilateral.  Since the circle's radius is 12, the side length of the equilateral triangle (AB = BC = AC) is also 12. \n* **Finding BD and DC:** AD bisects angle BAC, so angle BAD = angle CAD = 30 degrees. This means triangles ABD and ACD are 30-60-90 triangles.  Since AB = 12, we can use the side ratios of a 30-60-90 triangle to find BD and DC:\n    BD = AB/2 = 6\n    DC = BD\u221a3 = 6\u221a3 \n* **Finding AD (the Altitude of ABD):**  AD is the altitude of triangle ABD.  Using the 30-60-90 triangle ratios in triangle ABD:\n    AD = BD\u221a3 = 6\u221a3\n* **Calculating the Area of Triangle ABD:**\n    Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * BD * AD = (1/2) * 6 * 6\u221a3 = 18\u221a3\n\n**4.

Key Insight:**\nThe key is to realize we need to find the difference in areas between these shapes to calculate the desired probability.\n\n**3.  Calculate the Area of the Outer Square:**\n* The side of the outer square is 20 inches.\n* Area of a square = side * side = 20 inches * 20 inches = 400 square inches\n\n**4. Calculate the Area of the Circle:**\n* The diameter of the circle is equal to the side of the outer square, which is 20 inches.\n* Radius of the circle = diameter / 2 = 20 inches / 2 = 10 inches\n* Area of a circle = \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 = \u03c0 * (10 inches)\u00b2 = 100\u03c0 square inches\n\n**5.

Calculate the Desired Area:**\n* Area between the squares but outside the circle = (Area of outer square) - (Area of circle) + (Area of inner square) \n*  = 400 square inches - 100\u03c0 square inches + 200 square inches \n*  = 600 - 100\u03c0 square inches \n\n**9.

            "reasoning": "This problem relies heavily on spatial reasoning and visualization. Here's how to solve it:\n\n1. **Visualize the Edges:**  The smaller cubes with exactly two red faces are those lying along the edges of the larger cube (excluding the corner cubes, which have three red faces).\n\n2. **Calculate Edge Cubes:** A cube formed from 125 smaller cubes has 5 smaller cubes along each edge (since 5 x 5 x 5 = 125).  Since each edge shares corner cubes with other edges, there are 5 - 2 = 3 cubes on each edge with exactly two red faces. \n\n3. **Account for All Edges:**  A cube has 12 edges. Therefore, the total number of smaller cubes with exactly two red faces is 12 edges * 3 cubes/edge = 36 cubes.\n\n**Therefore, there are 36 smaller cubes with exactly two sides painted red.**",
