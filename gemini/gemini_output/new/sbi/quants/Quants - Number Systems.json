Understand the Problem:** We need to determine the factor by which the second laser pulse duration (2.5 x 10^-13 seconds) is greater than the first pulse duration (8.5 x 10^-15 seconds). \n\n**2.

Understand the Identity:**\nThe given equation is actually a factored form of the cube of a binomial:\n(x + y)^3 = x^3 + y^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2\n\n**2. Apply the Given Values:**\nSubstitute a = 8 and b = 27 into the equation:\n(8^(1/3) + 27^(1/3))^3 = 8 + 27 + 3(8^(2/3)27^(1/3) + 8^(1/3)27^(2/3))\n\n**3. Simplify:**\n* 8^(1/3) = cube root of 8 = 2\n* 27^(1/3) = cube root of 27 = 3\n\nSubstitute these values back into the equation:\n(2 + 3)^3 = 8 + 27 + 3(2^2 * 3 + 2 * 3^2)\n\n**4. Calculate:**\n* (2 + 3)^3 = 5^3 = 125\n* 8 + 27 + 3(2^2 * 3 + 2 * 3^2) = 35 + 3(12 + 18) = 125\n\n**5. Find the Target Value:**\nWe now know that (8^(1/3) + 27^(1/3)) = 5.

            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "Let's break down this problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Finding X:**\n* We need the largest 8-bit binary number that converts to a single-digit base-17 number. \n* The largest 8-bit binary number is 11111111 (255 in decimal).\n*  We need to find the largest power of 17 that is less than 255. 17^1 = 17, and 17^2 = 289, so the largest power is 17^1.\n* The largest single-digit base-17 number is G (which equals 16 in decimal).\n* Therefore, X in binary is 11111111 (255 in decimal) and G in base-17 (16 in decimal).\n\n**2. Finding Z:**\n* We know the sum of the digits of Z in hexadecimal equals 13 (decimal).\n*  We also know Y = X * Z in decimal, and since X is relatively small (16), Z must be a small number to keep Y within a reasonable range.\n*  Let's try different combinations for the digits of Z. A good starting point is using the hexadecimal digits D (13 in decimal) and 0 since 13 + 0 = 13.\n* This gives us Z = D0 (hexadecimal), which is 208 in decimal.\n\n**3. Finding Y:**\n* Y (decimal) = X (decimal) * Z (decimal) = 16 * 208 = 3328\n\n**4. Calculating X + Y + Z:**\n* First, we need to convert all numbers to a common base, like decimal:\n    * X = 255 (decimal)\n    * Y = 3328 (decimal)\n    * Z = 208 (decimal)\n* X + Y + Z = 255 + 3328 + 208 = 3791 (decimal)\n\n**5. Converting the sum to hexadecimal:**\n* 3791 divided by 256 (16^2) is 14 with a remainder of 215\n* 215 divided by 16 is 13 with a remainder of 7\n* So, 3791 in decimal is equivalent to ED7 in hexadecimal.\n\n**Therefore, the hexadecimal representation of the sum (X + Y + Z) is ED7.**\n",
