Comparing to Mean and Median:**\n\n* **Mean:** To calculate the mean, we sum up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores (10). This gives us a mean of approximately 81.\n* **Median:**  The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in order. First, we order the scores: 72, 72, 72, 78, 80, 82, 85, 88, 90, 91. Since we have an even number of scores, the median is the average of the two middle scores (80 and 82), which is 81.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn this dataset, the mode (72) is lower than both the mean (81) and median (81).

            "question": "Two venture capital firms, 'Alpha Investments' and 'Beta Capital', are evaluating the performance of their startup portfolios over the past 5 years.  Both firms focus on early-stage tech companies. \n\nHere's the annual percentage return for each firm's portfolio:\n\n| Year | Alpha Investments | Beta Capital |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 8% | -2% |\n| 2 | 15% | 25% |\n| 3 | -5% | 10% |\n| 4 | 22% | 7% |\n| 5 | 10% | 18% |\n\nWhile both firms have achieved a positive average return over the 5 years, which firm has demonstrated greater volatility in its portfolio performance, as measured by variance, and what does this difference in variance imply about each firm's investment strategy?",
            "difficulty": "hard",
            "reasoning": "This question is considered 'hard' due to the multi-step calculation required and the need to interpret the results in the context of investment strategy.\n\nHere's how to solve it:\n\n**1. Calculate the mean (average) return for each firm:**\n\n* **Alpha Investments:** (8% + 15% - 5% + 22% + 10%) / 5 = 10%\n* **Beta Capital:** (-2% + 25% + 10% + 7% + 18%) / 5 = 11.6%\n\n**2.  Calculate the squared deviations from the mean for each year:**\n\n* **Alpha Investments:**\n    * Year 1: (8% - 10%)\u00b2 = 0.04\n    * Year 2: (15% - 10%)\u00b2 = 0.25\n    * Year 3: (-5% - 10%)\u00b2 = 2.25\n    * Year 4: (22% - 10%)\u00b2 = 1.44\n    * Year 5: (10% - 10%)\u00b2 = 0\n* **Beta Capital:**\n    * Year 1: (-2% - 11.6%)\u00b2 = 1.85\n    * Year 2: (25% - 11.6%)\u00b2 =  1.85\n    * Year 3: (10% - 11.6%)\u00b2 = 0.03\n    * Year 4: (7% - 11.6%)\u00b2 = 0.21\n    * Year 5: (18% - 11.6%)\u00b2 = 0.41\n\n**3. Calculate the variance for each firm:**\n\n* **Alpha Investments:** (0.04 + 0.25 + 2.25 + 1.44 + 0) / (5-1) = **1.00** \n* **Beta Capital:** (1.85 + 1.85 + 0.03 + 0.21 + 0.41) / (5-1) = **1.09**\n\n**4. Interpretation:**\n\nBeta Capital has a slightly higher variance than Alpha Investments. This means that Beta Capital's portfolio returns have been more spread out from their average return compared to Alpha Investments.  In the context of investment strategy, this suggests that Beta Capital might be taking on riskier investments with the potential for both higher highs and lower lows. Alpha Investments, with its lower variance, might be employing a more conservative strategy, aiming for more consistent but potentially less spectacular returns.",
