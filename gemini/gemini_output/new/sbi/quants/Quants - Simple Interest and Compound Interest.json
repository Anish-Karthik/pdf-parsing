The Snowball Analogy:** The snowball represents the initial investment. As it rolls (over time), it picks up more snow (interest), which in turn makes it bigger and able to gather even more snow (compounding the interest). \n\n**2. Connecting to the Formula:** The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt).  Here's how each part relates to the snowball:\n    * **P (Principal):** This is the initial size of the snowball, the starting investment.\n    * **r (Interest rate):** This represents how much snow the snowball picks up relative to its size \u2013 a higher interest rate means it picks up snow faster.\n    * **n (Compounding frequency):**  This is like how often the snowball rolls over fresh snow. More frequent compounding (e.g., daily vs. yearly) means the snowball grows faster.\n    * **t (Time):** The longer the snowball rolls (the longer the investment period), the bigger it gets. \n\n**3. The 'Snowball Effect' in the Formula:** The key lies in the exponent (nt).  Each compounding period, the earned interest is added to the principal, and then *that* new amount earns interest. This is like the snowball getting bigger and thus picking up even more snow with each roll. The exponent reflects this repeated, accelerating growth, just like the snowball's exponential increase in size.",

            "question": "A shrewd investor named Alice has two investment opportunities: \n\n**Option A:** Invest $10,000 in a bond with a simple interest rate of 5% per annum for 5 years.\n**Option B:** Invest $10,000 in a fixed deposit with a 4.5% interest rate compounded annually for 5 years.\n\nAlice decides to spice things up. She chooses Option A for the first 3 years. After 3 years, she takes all her accumulated earnings from Option A and invests them in Option B for the remaining 2 years. \n\nCalculate the total amount Alice will have at the end of 5 years.",
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "This question blends simple and compound interest calculations, requiring a multi-step approach:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the interest earned from Option A for 3 years.**\n* Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100\n* Interest (Option A) = ($10,000 * 5 * 3) / 100 = $1,500\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total amount Alice has after 3 years (Option A).**\n* Total Amount (Option A) = Principal + Interest = $10,000 + $1,500 = $11,500\n\n**Step 3: Use the amount from Step 2 as the principal for Option B (for the remaining 2 years).**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the compound interest for Option B for 2 years.**\n* Formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) where:\n    * A = Final amount\n    * P = Principal ($11,500 from Step 2)\n    * r = Annual interest rate (4.5% or 0.045)\n    * n = Number of times interest is compounded per year (1, as it's compounded annually)\n    * t = Time in years (2 years)\n* A = $11,500(1 + 0.045/1)^(1*2)\n* A = $11,500(1.045)^2 \n* A \u2248 $12,541.11\n\n**Therefore, Alice will have approximately $12,541.11 at the end of 5 years.**\n\nThis question is tricky because it requires a clear understanding of when to apply simple interest and when to switch to compound interest calculations. The change in investment strategy mid-way demands careful attention to detail and accurate calculations.",
