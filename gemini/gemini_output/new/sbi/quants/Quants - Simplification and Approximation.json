            "reasoning": "**1. Understand the Ratio:** The ratio 2:3 means that for every 2 liters of blue paint, the painter needs 3 liters of yellow paint. This makes a total of 2 + 3 = 5 parts in the mixture.\n\n**2. Determine the Value of One Part:** Since the painter wants to make 10 liters of green paint, and the mixture has 5 parts, one part is equal to 10 liters / 5 parts = 2 liters/part.\n\n**3. Calculate the Amount of Yellow Paint:**  As the ratio of yellow paint is 3 parts, the painter needs 3 parts * 2 liters/part = 6 liters of yellow paint.\n\n**Therefore, the painter will need 6 liters of yellow paint to make 10 liters of the desired green paint.**",

Calculate Total Stack Height in Meters:**\n* The containers are stacked 8 high.\n* Assuming each container has a uniform height, the total stack height is 8 containers * container height (which we'll call 'h') = 8h meters\n\n**3. Determine Maximum Allowable Container Height:**\n* To pass under the bridge, the total stack height (8h meters) must be less than the clearance (10.67 meters).\n* Therefore, 8h < 10.67 meters\n* Solving for h, we get: h < 10.67 meters / 8 \u2248 1.33 meters\n\n**4. Calculate Maximum Allowable Container Length:**\n* We know the container volume (250 cubic meters) and the maximum height (1.33 meters).\n* We can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: Volume = length * width * height\n* Plugging in the values: 250 cubic meters = length * 12 meters * 1.33 meters\n* Simplifying: 250 cubic meters \u2248 15.96 meters * length\n* Solving for the length: length \u2248 250 cubic meters / 15.96 meters \u2248 15.67 meters\n\n**Therefore, the maximum allowable length of each container for the ship to pass safely under the bridge is approximately 15.67 meters.**",
