Find the volume of the original chocolate bar:**\n* Volume of a prism = Base Area * Height\n* Volume = 9\u221a3 cm\u00b2 * 10 cm = 90\u221a3 cm\u00b3\n\n**3. Calculate the base area of the new design:**\n* The new height is double the original, so it's 20 cm.\n* Volume remains the same (90\u221a3 cm\u00b3), so we can find the new base area.\n* New Base Area = Volume / New Height = 90\u221a3 cm\u00b3 / 20 cm = 4.5\u221a3 cm\u00b2\n\n**4. Determine the side length of the new triangular base:**\n* We know the new base area (4.5\u221a3 cm\u00b2) and the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle.\n* 4.5\u221a3 cm\u00b2 = (\u221a3/4) * side\u00b2\n* Solving for side\u00b2: side\u00b2 = (4.5\u221a3 cm\u00b2 * 4) / \u221a3 = 18 cm\u00b2\n* Taking the square root of both sides: side = \u221a18 cm = 3\u221a2 cm\n\n**Therefore, the side length of the triangular base of the new chocolate bar design will be 3\u221a2 cm.**",

Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* Divide the flowerbed into two shapes: an isosceles trapezoid (formed by the radii of the concentric circles and the straight sides) and a circular ring segment (the area between the two arcs).\n\n**3. Calculate the Area of the Trapezoid:**\n\n* The height of the trapezoid is the distance between the midpoints of the straight sides, which is 8 meters.\n* To find the lengths of the parallel sides of the trapezoid, draw radii from the center of the circles to the points where the arcs intersect the straight sides. This forms two right-angled triangles.\n* In these triangles, the hypotenuse is the radius (4m or 6m), and the angle opposite the height is half the angle subtended by the larger arc (120 degrees / 2 = 60 degrees).\n* Use trigonometry (sine) to find the opposite side (half the length of the parallel side) in each triangle:\n    * For the smaller triangle: sin(60\u00b0) = opposite / 4m  => opposite = 2\u221a3 m\n    * For the larger triangle: sin(60\u00b0) = opposite / 6m  => opposite = 3\u221a3 m\n* The lengths of the parallel sides are then 4\u221a3 m and 6\u221a3 m.\n* Area of the trapezoid = (1/2) * height * (sum of parallel sides) = (1/2) * 8m * (4\u221a3 m + 6\u221a3 m) = 40\u221a3 m\u00b2\n\n**4. Calculate the Area of the Circular Ring Segment:**\n\n* Area of the larger sector = (central angle / 360\u00b0) * \u03c0 * (larger radius)\u00b2 = (120\u00b0 / 360\u00b0) * \u03c0 * (6m)\u00b2 = 12\u03c0 m\u00b2\n* Area of the smaller sector = (central angle / 360\u00b0) * \u03c0 * (smaller radius)\u00b2 = (120\u00b0 / 360\u00b0) * \u03c0 * (4m)\u00b2 = (16/3)\u03c0 m\u00b2\n* Area of the ring segment = Area of larger sector - Area of smaller sector = 12\u03c0 m\u00b2 - (16/3)\u03c0 m\u00b2 = (20/3)\u03c0 m\u00b2\n\n**5.  Calculate the Total Area:**\n\n* Total area of the flowerbed = Area of trapezoid + Area of ring segment = 40\u221a3 m\u00b2 + (20/3)\u03c0 m\u00b2 \n\n**Therefore, the area of the flowerbed is 40\u221a3 m\u00b2 + (20/3)\u03c0 m\u00b2.**",

A solid sphere made of a metal alloy is then dropped into the container, causing the water level to rise to four-fifths of the cylinder's height.  If the metal alloy has a density of 8 g/cm\u00b3, what is the mass of the sphere?",
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "This problem involves multiple steps and concepts: calculating volumes of cylinders and spheres, understanding displacement of volume, and using density to find mass.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial volume of water:**\n   - The cylinder is filled to two-thirds of its height, so the water height is (2/3) * 20 cm = 13.33 cm.\n   - The volume of a cylinder is \u03c0r\u00b2h, so the initial water volume is \u03c0 * (10 cm)\u00b2 * 13.33 cm \u2248 4188.79 cm\u00b3.\n\n**2. Calculate the volume of water displaced:**\n   - After the sphere is added, the water rises to four-fifths of the cylinder's height, which is (4/5) * 20 cm = 16 cm.\n   - The new volume of water is \u03c0 * (10 cm)\u00b2 * 16 cm \u2248 5026.55 cm\u00b3.\n   - The volume of water displaced is 5026.55 cm\u00b3 - 4188.79 cm\u00b3 = 837.76 cm\u00b3.\n\n**3.  Understand displacement and the sphere's volume:**\n   - The volume of water displaced is equal to the volume of the sphere submerged in the water.\n   - Since the sphere is completely submerged, the volume of the sphere is 837.76 cm\u00b3.\n\n**4. Calculate the mass of the sphere:**\n   - Density = Mass / Volume\n   - Mass = Density * Volume\n   - Mass = 8 g/cm\u00b3 * 837.76 cm\u00b3 \u2248 6702.08 g\n\n**Therefore, the mass of the sphere is approximately 6702.08 grams.**",
