Applying the multiplication rule for independent events:**\n* The events of drawing a red marble and then a blue marble (after replacement) are independent because the outcome of the first event doesn't affect the outcome of the second event.\n* To find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\n**Calculation:**\n (4/10) * (6/10) = 24/100 = 6/25\n\n**Therefore, the probability of drawing a red marble followed by a blue marble is 6/25.**",

A positive covariance indicates a tendency to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance suggests movement in opposite directions. A covariance of zero implies no linear relationship.\n\n**Key Insight:**\n\nIn this scenario, Player B's score (Y) is always 7, making it a constant value, regardless of Player A's score.  Because Y doesn't vary, there's no way for it to covary with X.\n\n**Mathematical Proof:**\n\n* **Cov(X,Y) = E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])] ** (Formula for covariance)\n* Since Y is always 7, E[Y] = 7\n* Substituting, we get: Cov(X,Y) = E[(X - E[X])(7 - 7)]\n* Simplifying: Cov(X,Y) = E[(X - E[X]) * 0]\n* Therefore: Cov(X,Y) = 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe covariance between Player A's score and Player B's score is 0.

Here's why the correct answer is **Normal distribution with a mean of approximately 11.91 and a standard deviation dependent on the population standard deviation.**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Central Limit Theorem:** The CLT states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying population distribution, as long as the sample size is sufficiently large (generally n \u2265 30). \n* **Our Scenario:** Even though we don't know the underlying population distribution of coffee serving sizes, the Central Limit Theorem tells us that the average of a week's worth of coffee servings will be approximately normally distributed.\n* **Mean:** The mean of the sample means will be approximately equal to the population mean, which the coffee shop claims is 12 ounces. Our sample mean is approximately 11.91 ounces.\n* **Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation of the sample means (also known as the standard error) is calculated by dividing the population standard deviation by the square root of the sample size. However, we don't know the population standard deviation in this case. \n\n**Therefore, we can conclude that the distribution of the average serving size for the week is approximately normal, centered around 11.91 ounces, but we need additional information (the population standard deviation) to determine the exact standard deviation of this distribution.**",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define the Random Variable:**\n\nLet X represent the net profit a player makes from buying a single loot box.\n\n**2.  Possible Values of X:**\n\n* **Win Rare Item:** X = $20 (item value) - $2 (box cost) = $18\n* **Win Common Item:** X = $5 (item value) - $2 (box cost) = $3\n* **Win No Item:**  X = $0 (item value) - $2 (box cost) = -$2 \n\n**3. Probability Distribution:**\n\n| X     | $18  | $3   | -$2  |\n|-------|------|------|------|\n| P(X) | 0.10 | 0.30 | 0.60 |\n\n**4. Calculate Expected Value (E[X]):**\n\nE[X] = \u03a3 [x * P(x)] = ($18 * 0.10) + ($3 * 0.30) + (-$2 * 0.60) = $1.80 + $0.90 - $1.20 = **$1.50**\n\n**5. Calculate Variance (Var[X]):**\n\nVar[X] = E[X\u00b2] - (E[X])\u00b2 \n\n* First, calculate E[X\u00b2]: E[X\u00b2] = \u03a3 [x\u00b2 * P(x)] = ($18\u00b2 * 0.10) + ($3\u00b2 * 0.30) + (-$2\u00b2 * 0.60) = $32.40 + $2.70 + $2.40 = $37.50\n* Now, find Var[X]: Var[X] = $37.50 - ($1.50)\u00b2 = $37.50 - $2.25 = **$35.25**\n\n**Therefore, the expected net profit from buying a loot box is $1.50, and the variance is $35.25.**",

Calculate the probability of one outage for each scenario:**\n   * **Reduced Rate Scenario:** Use the Poisson distribution formula with \u03bb = 1\n      P(X = 1) = (e^-1 * 1^1) / 1! \u2248 0.368\n   * **Increased Rate Scenario:** Use the Poisson distribution formula with \u03bb = 2.4\n      P(X = 1) = (e^-2.4 * 2.4^1) / 1! \u2248 0.261\n\n**3.

            "reasoning": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis question dives into the application of covariance and correlation in analyzing investment portfolios, specifically focusing on risk reduction through diversification.\n\n**1. Understanding Portfolio Variance**\n\nThe variance of a portfolio's return is not simply the weighted average of individual asset variances. It also critically considers the covariance between the assets, reflecting how they move together.\n\nThe formula for the variance of a two-asset portfolio is:\n\n```\nVar(Portfolio) = w\u2081\u00b2 * Var(X) + w\u2082\u00b2 * Var(Y) + 2 * w\u2081 * w\u2082 * Cov(X, Y) \n```\n\nwhere:\n\n* w\u2081 and w\u2082 are the weights of the assets in the portfolio (0.7 and 0.3 in this case)\n* Var(X) and Var(Y) are the variances of the individual asset returns\n* Cov(X, Y) is the covariance between the returns of the two assets\n\n**2. Calculating Covariance from Correlation**\n\nWe are given the correlation coefficient (\u03c1) and individual variances, and we can use the following relationship to calculate covariance:\n\n```\nCorrelation(X, Y) = Cov(X, Y) / (SD(X) * SD(Y))\n```\n\nRearranging to solve for covariance:\n\n```\nCov(X, Y) = Correlation(X, Y) * SD(X) * SD(Y)\n```\n\nWe can calculate the standard deviations (SD) by taking the square root of the variances:\n\n* SD(X) = \u221aVar(X) = \u221a0.0004 = 0.02\n* SD(Y) = \u221aVar(Y) = \u221a0.0001 = 0.01\n\nNow, we can calculate the covariance:\n\n```\nCov(X, Y) = -0.6 * 0.02 * 0.01 = -0.00012\n```\n\n**3. Calculating Portfolio Variance**\n\nPlugging the values into the portfolio variance formula:\n\n```\nVar(Portfolio) = (0.7)\u00b2 * 0.0004 + (0.3)\u00b2 * 0.0001 + 2 * 0.7 * 0.3 * (-0.00012)\n             = 0.000196 + 0.000009 - 0.0000504\n             = 0.0001546\n```\n\n**4. Interpreting the Result**\n\nThe variance of the portfolio (0.0001546) is less than the variance of either individual stock (0.0004 for TechCorp and 0.0001 for Innovate Inc.). This demonstrates that diversification has reduced the risk of the portfolio. The negative correlation between the two stocks implies they tend to move in opposite directions, which helps to offset losses in one stock with gains in the other.\n\n**Therefore, diversifying the portfolio in this way has decreased risk.**",
