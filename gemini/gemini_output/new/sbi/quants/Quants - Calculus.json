Here's why the provided differential equation is appropriate and how to solve it:\n\n**Explanation:** \n\n* **Understanding the Problem:** The problem states that the bacteria population grows at a rate proportional to its size. This means the larger the population, the faster it grows. This type of growth is commonly modeled using exponential functions.\n* **Formulating the Differential Equation:** The rate of change of the population with respect to time (dP/dt) is proportional to the current population (P). We use a proportionality constant 'k' to relate these two quantities. Hence, we get the differential equation: dP/dt = kP. \n* **Solving the Differential Equation:** This is a separable differential equation. We can solve it as follows:\n    1. **Separate Variables:** (dP/P) = k dt\n    2. **Integrate both sides:** \u222b(dP/P) = \u222bk dt\n    3. **Solve the integral:** ln|P| = kt + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n    4. **Solve for P:** P = e^(kt+C) = e^C * e^(kt).  Since e^C is just another constant, we can write it as A. Therefore, P = A*e^(kt)\n* **Applying the Initial Condition:** We are given that P(0) = 1000. Plugging in t=0 and P=1000 into our equation, we get 1000 = A*e^(k*0) = A. So, A = 1000.\n* **Final Solution:** The equation representing the number of bacteria as a function of time is P(t) = 1000e^(kt). \n\n**Therefore, the provided differential equation accurately models the given scenario, and the solution steps demonstrate a clear understanding of connecting rates of change to unknown functions and solving basic differential equations.**",

Visualize the Problem:**\n\n   Imagine the particle moving along the cubic curve. The camera, fixed at (0,5), follows the particle. We're interested in the moment the particle is at (2,0). Draw a diagram to represent this situation.\n\n**2. Define Variables:**\n\n   * Let  'x' be the particle's x-coordinate.\n   * Let '\u03b8' be the camera's angle of elevation (angle between the horizontal and the line connecting the camera to the particle).\n\n**3. Formulate an Equation:**\n\n   We need a relationship between \u03b8 and x. Using trigonometry (specifically, tan):\n\n   ```\n   tan(\u03b8) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side) \n   ```\n\n   From the diagram, we see:\n\n   * Opposite side = y-coordinate of the particle - y-coordinate of the camera = (x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x) - 5\n   * Adjacent side = x-coordinate of the particle - x-coordinate of the camera = x - 0 = x\n\n   Therefore: \n   ```\n   tan(\u03b8) = [(x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x) - 5] / x \n   ```\n\n**4. Implicit Differentiation:**\n\n   Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time 't'. Remember, both \u03b8 and x are functions of time:\n\n   ```\n   sec^2(\u03b8) * (d\u03b8/dt) = [ (3x^2 - 6x + 2) * (dx/dt) - 0 ] / x  -  [(x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x) - 5] * (dx/dt) / x^2\n   ```\n\n**5. Substitute Known Values:**\n\n   We need to find d\u03b8/dt (the rate of change of the angle) when x = 2.  We also know that at this point, y = 0.\n\n   * First, find  d\u03b8/dt: We can use the equation y = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x and the fact that dx/dt (the particle's speed in the x-direction) is constant to find dy/dt (the particle's speed in the y-direction). However, the problem doesn't provide the value of dx/dt. This means we need to express our final answer in terms of dx/dt.\n   * Next, find \u03b8 when x = 2 and y = 0. From our tan(\u03b8) equation:\n     ```\n     tan(\u03b8) = [(2^3 - 3 * 2^2 + 2 * 2) - 5] / 2 = -3/2 \n     ```\n     Since the particle is below and to the right of the camera, \u03b8 is in the fourth quadrant. Therefore,  sec^2(\u03b8) = 1 + tan^2(\u03b8) = 1 + (-3/2)^2 = 13/4\n\n**6. Solve for d\u03b8/dt:**\n\n   Substitute all known values back into the equation from step 4 and solve for d\u03b8/dt. You'll find that the expression will involve dx/dt.\n\n**7. Interpretation:**\n\n   The final result will give you the rate of change of the camera's angle of elevation (d\u03b8/dt) in terms of the particle's speed in the x-direction (dx/dt) when the particle is at the point (2,0).  The negative sign of d\u03b8/dt will indicate that the angle is decreasing, as the camera points downward.",
