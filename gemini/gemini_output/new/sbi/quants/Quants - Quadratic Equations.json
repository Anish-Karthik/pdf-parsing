            "reasoning": "**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe equation h = -4.9t\u00b2 + 29.4t + 2 represents a parabola opening downwards (because the coefficient of the t\u00b2 term is negative). Finding when the projectile hits the ground means finding the time (t) when the height (h) is zero. This is equivalent to finding the x-intercepts (or roots) of the parabola.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Discriminant**\n\nTo determine the nature of the roots (and therefore the projectile's trajectory), we'll calculate the discriminant (\u0394) of the quadratic equation -4.9t\u00b2 + 29.4t + 2 = 0:\n\n* \u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac \n* a = -4.9, b = 29.4, c = 2\n* \u0394 = (29.4)\u00b2 - 4 * (-4.9) * 2 = 864.36 + 39.2 = 903.56\n\n**3. Interpreting the Discriminant**\n\nSince the discriminant (\u0394) is positive (903.56 > 0), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots. \n\n**4. Relating to the Projectile's Trajectory**\n\nHaving two distinct real roots means the parabola representing the projectile's height intersects the x-axis (h=0) at two different points in time. This makes sense for a projectile's trajectory because it is launched at one point in time and then hits the ground at a later point in time.  \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe positive discriminant tells us that the equation -4.9t\u00b2 + 29.4t + 2 = 0 has two distinct real roots, indicating that the projectile will indeed hit the ground at two different points in time (although one root might be negative and represent a time before the projectile was launched).",

Substituting 82 for 'h', we get:\n   -0.02x\u00b2 + 1.6x - 10 = 82\n\n2. **Simplify the equation:**\n   To use the quadratic formula, we need the equation in standard quadratic form (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0).  Subtracting 82 from both sides gives us:\n   -0.02x\u00b2 + 1.6x - 92 = 0\n\n3. **Apply the quadratic formula:**\n   The quadratic formula states that for an equation in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the solutions for 'x' are given by:\n   x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n   In our equation, a = -0.02, b = 1.6, and c = -92.

Calculating the discriminant:\n   1.6\u00b2 - 4 * -0.02 * -92 = 2.56 - 7.36 = -4.8\n   Since the discriminant is negative, the equation has two complex roots, meaning the firework doesn't reach a height of 82 feet.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The firework doesn't reach a height of 82 feet.

            "question": "A drone manufacturer is testing the flight path of their newest model. The drone is programmed to follow a parabolic path, ascending to a certain height before smoothly descending. The drone's height (h) in meters above the ground after 't' seconds is given by the equation h = -0.2t\u00b2 + 4t + 1. To analyze the flight data, the engineers want to know the exact times when the drone will be at a height of 7 meters. Determine these times, keeping in mind that the drone reaches 7 meters on both its ascent and descent.",

            "reasoning": "This question falls under the 'Applications of Quadratic Equations in Real-World Problems' within the broader topic of 'Quants - Quadratic Equations.'  It's designed to be 'tricky 9/10' due to these factors:\n\n* **Real-World Context:** The scenario of a drone's flight path adds a layer of complexity beyond a purely abstract quadratic equation.\n* **Two Solutions Required:**  The question emphasizes that the drone reaches the specified height twice, requiring the student to find both solutions to the quadratic equation.\n* **No Leading Information:** The question doesn't explicitly guide the student to use the quadratic formula, making it more challenging.\n\n**Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:**\n\n1. **Set up the Equation:** We're given the drone's height equation (h = -0.2t\u00b2 + 4t + 1) and need to find the times (t) when the height (h) is 7 meters. So, we set up the equation:\n\n   7 = -0.2t\u00b2 + 4t + 1\n\n2. **Rearrange into Standard Form:**  Subtract 7 from both sides to get a standard quadratic equation:\n\n   0 = -0.2t\u00b2 + 4t - 6\n\n3. **Solve for 't' using the Quadratic Formula:** The quadratic formula is used to find the roots (solutions) of a quadratic equation in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0.  In this case, a = -0.2, b = 4, and c = -6. \n\n   t = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\n   Substitute the values:\n\n   t = (-4 \u00b1 \u221a(4\u00b2 - 4 * -0.2 * -6)) / (2 * -0.2)\n\n   Simplify:\n\n   t = (-4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 - 4.8)) / (-0.4)\n   t = (-4 \u00b1 \u221a11.2) / (-0.4)\n\n   Calculate the two possible values of 't':\n\n   t1 = (-4 + \u221a11.2) / (-0.4) \u2248 2.36 seconds\n   t2 = (-4 - \u221a11.2) / (-0.4) \u2248 17.64 seconds\n\n**Therefore, the drone will be at a height of 7 meters at approximately 2.36 seconds (during ascent) and 17.64 seconds (during descent).**",

The riddle speaks of a quadratic equation, the key to unlocking the treasure's location. Alice remembers a fragment of the riddle: 'The sum of the squares of the roots is 20, and their product is 5.'  Bob recalls another piece: 'The difference between the squares of the roots is a positive multiple of 8.'

            "reasoning": "Let the roots of the quadratic equation be \u03b1 and \u03b2.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n* \u03b1\u00b2 + \u03b2\u00b2 = 20 \n* \u03b1\u03b2 = 5\n* \u03b1\u00b2 - \u03b2\u00b2 = 8k (where k is a positive integer)\n\n**Step 1: Utilize the relationship between roots and coefficients.**\n\nRecall the following relationships for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0:\n\n* Sum of roots: \u03b1 + \u03b2 = -b/a\n* Product of roots: \u03b1\u03b2 = c/a\n\n**Step 2: Express the given information in terms of these relationships.**\n\nWe already have \u03b1\u03b2 = 5.  \n\nNotice that (\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u00b2 = \u03b1\u00b2 + 2\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b2\u00b2 .  We can rearrange this to find \u03b1\u00b2 + \u03b2\u00b2: \n\n(\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u00b2 - 2\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b1\u00b2 + \u03b2\u00b2 = 20\n\nSimilarly, (\u03b1 - \u03b2)\u00b2 = \u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b2\u00b2. Rearranging gives us:\n\n(\u03b1 - \u03b2)\u00b2 + 2\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b1\u00b2 - \u03b2\u00b2 = 8k\n\n**Step 3: Solve for (\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u00b2 and (\u03b1 - \u03b2)\u00b2**\n\nSubstitute the known value of \u03b1\u03b2 = 5:\n\n(\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u00b2 - 2(5) = 20  =>  (\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u00b2 = 30\n(\u03b1 - \u03b2)\u00b2 + 2(5) = 8k  =>  (\u03b1 - \u03b2)\u00b2 = 8k - 10\n\n**Step 4: Determine the value of k**\n\nSince (\u03b1 - \u03b2)\u00b2 is a square, it must be non-negative. Therefore, 8k - 10 \u2265 0. The smallest integer value of k that satisfies this inequality is k = 2.\n\n**Step 5:  Calculate (\u03b1 - \u03b2)\u00b2**\n\nWith k = 2, we have (\u03b1 - \u03b2)\u00b2 = 8(2) - 10 = 6\n\n**Step 6:  Formulate the quadratic equation**\n\nWe now know:\n\n* (\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u00b2 = 30\n* (\u03b1 - \u03b2)\u00b2 = 6\n\nExpanding these equations, we get:\n\n\u03b1\u00b2 + 2\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b2\u00b2 = 30\n\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b2\u00b2 = 6\n\nAdding these equations eliminates the 2\u03b1\u03b2 term, leaving us with:\n\n2\u03b1\u00b2 + 2\u03b2\u00b2 = 36\n\nDividing by 2, we get:\n\n\u03b1\u00b2 + \u03b2\u00b2 = 18\n\nWe know \u03b1\u03b2 = 5.  Using the relationship  (\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u00b2 = \u03b1\u00b2 + 2\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b2\u00b2 = 18 + 2(5) = 28\n\nTherefore, \u03b1 + \u03b2 = \u00b1\u221a28 = \u00b12\u221a7\n\nWe can now form two possible quadratic equations using the sum and product of roots:\n\n* x\u00b2 - (2\u221a7)x + 5 = 0\n* x\u00b2 + (2\u221a7)x + 5 = 0 \n\nSince the question asks for integer coefficients, we need to square the second equation to eliminate the radical, resulting in:\n\n* x\u2074 + 28x\u00b2 + 25 = 0\n\nHowever, this is a quartic equation. Therefore, the only valid quadratic equation is:\n\n* x\u00b2 - (2\u221a7)x + 5 = 0\n\nTo get integer coefficients, we can multiply the entire equation by \u221a7:\n\n* \u221a7x\u00b2 - 14x + 5\u221a7 = 0\n\nThis equation doesn't have integer coefficients. Therefore, there is no quadratic equation with integer coefficients that satisfies all the given conditions. The riddle is a trick!",
