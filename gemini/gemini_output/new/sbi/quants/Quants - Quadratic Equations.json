Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe given quadratic function, h(t) = -5t\u00b2 + 40t + 2, represents a parabola opening downwards (since the coefficient of the t\u00b2 term is negative). The vertex of this parabola represents the highest point of the firework's trajectory.\n\n**2.

In this case, a = -5 and b = 40.\n\nTherefore, t = -40 / (2 * -5) = 4 seconds. This means the firework will reach its maximum height after 4 seconds.\n\n**3.

What can you conclude about the nature of the solutions to this quadratic equation, and what does this tell us about the projectile's trajectory?",
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe equation h = -4.9t\u00b2 + 29.4t + 2 represents a parabola opening downwards (because the coefficient of the t\u00b2 term is negative). Finding when the projectile hits the ground means finding the time (t) when the height (h) is zero. This is equivalent to finding the x-intercepts (or roots) of the parabola.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Discriminant**\n\nTo determine the nature of the roots (and therefore the projectile's trajectory), we'll calculate the discriminant (\u0394) of the quadratic equation -4.9t\u00b2 + 29.4t + 2 = 0:\n\n* \u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac \n* a = -4.9, b = 29.4, c = 2\n* \u0394 = (29.4)\u00b2 - 4 * (-4.9) * 2 = 864.36 + 39.2 = 903.56\n\n**3. Interpreting the Discriminant**\n\nSince the discriminant (\u0394) is positive (903.56 > 0), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots. \n\n**4. Relating to the Projectile's Trajectory**\n\nHaving two distinct real roots means the parabola representing the projectile's height intersects the x-axis (h=0) at two different points in time. This makes sense for a projectile's trajectory because it is launched at one point in time and then hits the ground at a later point in time.  \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe positive discriminant tells us that the equation -4.9t\u00b2 + 29.4t + 2 = 0 has two distinct real roots, indicating that the projectile will indeed hit the ground at two different points in time (although one root might be negative and represent a time before the projectile was launched).",

Substituting 82 for 'h', we get:\n   -0.02x\u00b2 + 1.6x - 10 = 82\n\n2. **Simplify the equation:**\n   To use the quadratic formula, we need the equation in standard quadratic form (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0).

So, we can plug this value into the equation:\n   60 = -4.9t\u00b2 + 40t\n\n2. **Rearrange into standard quadratic form:** To solve for 't', we need to rearrange the equation into the standard quadratic form (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0): \n   4.9t\u00b2 - 40t + 60 = 0\n\n3. **Solve the quadratic equation:**  This equation doesn't factor easily, so we can use the quadratic formula to solve for 't':\n   t = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\n   Where a = 4.9, b = -40, and c = 60.\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   t = (40 \u00b1 \u221a((-40)\u00b2 - 4 * 4.9 * 60)) / (2 * 4.9)\n   t = (40 \u00b1 \u221a(1600 - 1176)) / 9.8\n   t = (40 \u00b1 \u221a424) / 9.8\n   t \u2248 (40 \u00b1 20.6) / 9.8\n\n   This gives us two possible solutions:\n   t1 \u2248 (40 + 20.6) / 9.8 \u2248 6.2 seconds\n   t2 \u2248 (40 - 20.6) / 9.8 \u2248 1.98 seconds\n\n4. **Interpret the solutions:** The firework will reach a height of 60 meters twice: once on the way up (after approximately 1.98 seconds) and once on the way down (after approximately 6.2 seconds).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the firework will reach a height of 60 meters after approximately 1.98 seconds and again after approximately 6.2 seconds.

Transformations:**\n* Students need to analyze the given equation and identify the transformations applied to the basic quadratic function y = x\u00b2. This involves recognizing the vertical stretch by a factor of -5 (leading to reflection across the x-axis) and a vertical shift upwards by 0 units. \n\n**2. Vertex Interpretation:**\n* The question requires finding the vertex of the parabola, which represents the maximum height of the firework and the time it takes to reach it.

Finding the Vertex:**\n   *  The vertex of the parabola represents the maximum point.

We can do this by factoring the equation and finding the x-intercepts (where the graph crosses the x-axis). The x-coordinate of the vertex will be exactly in the middle of these two x-intercepts.\n\nFirst, rearrange the equation:\n\n2x\u00b2 - 70x + A = 0\n\nNow, we need to factor this equation. Since 'A' represents the area and we don't have a specific numerical value for it, we'll focus on factoring the part with 'x':\n\n2x\u00b2 - 70x = 2x(x - 35)\n\nThis tells us that the x-intercepts are at x = 0 and x = 35. The x-coordinate of the vertex is the midpoint of these values, which is (0 + 35) / 2 = 17.5.\n\nSo, the width (x) that maximizes the area is 17.5 meters.

The solutions of this equation represent the points where the parabola intersects the x-axis.  We need to find the values of 'k' for which there are 7 integers between these roots.\n\n3. **Visualizing:** Imagine the parabola. Since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is negative, it opens downwards. For the inequality to hold true for exactly 7 integer values, the parabola needs to intersect the x-axis at points such that there are 7 integers between the points of intersection. \n\n4. **Factoring and Integer Solutions:** The key is to realize that for the quadratic to have integer solutions, its discriminant must be a perfect square. The discriminant (\u0394) is given by:\n\n   \u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac = 5\u00b2 - 4(-2)(k-3) = 25 + 8k - 24 = 8k + 1 \n\n   We need to find values of 'k' such that 8k + 1 is a perfect square and the parabola encloses 7 integers.\n\n5. **Testing Values:**  We start testing integer values of 'k' to find suitable values that result in a perfect square for the discriminant and satisfy the 7 integer solution criteria:\n\n   - For 'k' = 1, \u0394 = 9 (perfect square), but the parabola won't enclose 7 integers\n   - Continue testing values of 'k' systematically (k = 3, k = 6, etc.)\n\n6. **Solution:** Through trial and error, we discover that when k = 10, the discriminant \u0394 = 81, which is a perfect square.

It requires understanding transformations (shifting, stretching) and their impact on the function's range. \n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify Transformations:** The function h(t) = -2(t - 3)^2 + 100 is a transformation of the basic quadratic function f(t) = t^2.\n    * -2 coefficient: Reflects the parabola across the x-axis and stretches it vertically by a factor of 2.\n    * (t - 3): Shifts the parabola 3 units to the right.\n    * +100: Shifts the parabola 100 units up.\n\n2. **Visualize the Parabola:**  Imagine a basic parabola. The transformations indicate it's flipped, stretched vertically, and shifted right and up.\n\n3. **Find Time Intervals for Visible Height:** We need to find when the height, h(t), is between 50 and 90 pixels.\n    * **Lower Bound (50 pixels):** Solve the equation -2(t - 3)^2 + 100 = 50 \n       *  -2(t - 3)^2 = -50\n       *  (t - 3)^2 = 25\n       *  t - 3 = \u00b15 \n       *  t = 8 or t = -2 (We discard t = -2 as time cannot be negative.)\n    * **Upper Bound (90 pixels):** Solve -2(t - 3)^2 + 100 = 90\n       * -2(t - 3)^2 = -10\n       * (t - 3)^2 = 5\n       * t - 3 = \u00b1\u221a5\n       * t = 3 + \u221a5  or t = 3 - \u221a5\n\n4. **Time Interval:** Combining the solutions, the firework is visible between t = 3 - \u221a5 seconds and t = 3 + \u221a5 seconds, and also between t = 8 seconds and the time it takes to reach the ground after the second crossing of 90 pixels. Since the question asks for the interval where it's visible between 50 and 90 pixels, the final answer is **3 - \u221a5  \u2264 t \u2264 3 + \u221a5**\n\nThis question is challenging due to the required understanding of transformations, solving quadratic inequalities, and interpreting the results within the context of the problem.",
