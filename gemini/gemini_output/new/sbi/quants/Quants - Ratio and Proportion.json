To get 40 liters, he needs to multiply this base ratio by 5 (8 liters x 5 = 40 liters). This means he'll need 25 liters of blue (5 liters x 5 = 25 liters) and 15 liters of yellow (3 liters x 5 = 15 liters).\n\n2. **Calculate the remaining blue paint required:** He already has 18 liters of blue paint and needs a total of 25 liters. Therefore, he needs to acquire 7 more liters of blue paint (25 liters - 18 liters = 7 liters).\n\n3. **Calculate the number of yellow paint cans:** He needs 15 liters of yellow paint and each can holds 2 liters.  Thus, he needs to buy 7.5 cans of yellow paint (15 liters / 2 liters/can = 7.5 cans).\n\n4. **Account for whole cans:** Since he can only buy whole cans of yellow paint, he needs to purchase 8 cans to have enough. \n\n**Therefore, the painter needs to buy 8 cans of yellow paint.**",

Calculate Proportional Amounts Based on Liquid B:**\n\n   * The chemist has 120 ml of liquid B, which represents '3' in the ratio.\n   * To find the amount of liquid A needed, we set up a proportion:  2/3 = x/120.

Understanding the Relationship between Area Ratio and Scale Factor**\n\nThe ratio of the areas of similar figures is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides (scale factor).

Finding the Length of a Corresponding Side in Pentagon ABCDE**\n\nLet x be the length of side GH.

Now, for a new project, the company needs to adjust the ratio of materials slightly.

Calculate the weight of each component in the original mix:**\n\n   * The total ratio parts are 2 + 3 + 5 = 10\n   * Weight of cement in one bag: (2/10) * 300 kg = 60 kg\n   * Weight of sand in one bag: (3/10) * 300 kg = 90 kg\n   * Weight of gravel in one bag: (5/10) * 300 kg = 150 kg\n\n**2.  Determine the scaling factor for the new ratio:**\n\n   * Notice that the gravel portion of the ratio remains the same in both the original and new mix. This means the gravel weight in the bag will remain constant at 150kg.\n   * Since the total weight of the bag remains 300kg, the combined weight of cement and sand in the new mix must also remain 150kg (300 kg - 150 kg = 150 kg).\n\n**3.  Calculate the weight of each component in the new mix:**\n\n   * The total ratio parts for the cement and sand in the new mix are 3 + 4 = 7\n   * Weight of cement in the new mix: (3/7) * 150 kg = 64.29 kg (approximately)\n   * Weight of sand in the new mix: (4/7) * 150 kg = 85.71 kg (approximately)\n\n**4. Calculate the additional weight of cement and sand:**\n\n   * Additional cement needed: 64.29 kg - 60 kg = 4.29 kg (approximately)\n   * Additional sand needed: 85.71 kg - 90 kg = -4.29 kg (approximately)\n\n**5.  Find the combined weight of added cement and sand:**\n\n   * Since we are adding cement and the sand weight is actually decreasing, to find the combined weight of the changes, we take the absolute values of the changes and add them together. \n   *  4.29 kg + 4.29 kg = 8.58 kg (approximately)\n\n**Therefore, approximately 8.58 kg of additional cement and sand combined need to be added to each bag to achieve the new ratio.**",

            "difficulty": "hard",

Here's a step-by-step solution: \n\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let 'x' be the number of parts of the first bag (1:2:3 ratio). \n* Let 'y' be the number of parts of the second bag (3:4:5 ratio). \n\n**2. Set up Equations:**\nWe need to find the ratio x:y that will create the 2:3:5 ratio.  We can set up equations based on each component: \n\n* **Cement:** (1x + 3y) / (6x + 12y) = 2/10  (Simplifying, this becomes x + 3y = 1.2x + 2.4y)\n* **Sand:** (2x + 4y) / (6x + 12y) = 3/10 (Simplifying, this becomes 2x + 4y = 1.8x + 3.6y)\n* **Gravel:** (3x + 5y) / (6x + 12y) = 5/10 (Simplifying, this becomes 3x + 5y = 3x + 6y)\n\n**3. Solve for x and y:**\nNotice that the 'Gravel' equation immediately simplifies to y = 0.  This isn't logically possible as we need both bags for the mixture. This tells us we can't achieve the exact 2:3:5 ratio using only these two bag types. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the *simplest ratio* to get as *close as possible*.  Looking at the 'Cement' and 'Sand' equations, they both simplify to similar expressions (0.2x = 0.6y). This tells us that to get closest to the desired ratio, we need to have three times as much of the second bag (3:4:5) as the first bag (1:2:3). \n\n**4. Express as a Ratio:**\nTherefore, the simplest ratio of the first bag to the second bag is **1:3**. \n\n**Note:**  This ratio won't create the exact 2:3:5 mix, but it's the closest we can get using only the given pre-mixed bag types.",
