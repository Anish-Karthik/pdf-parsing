Here's why:\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Application of Logarithmic Identity:** The question requires understanding and applying the logarithmic identity for the sum of logarithms with the same base: log\u2090(b) + log\u2090(c) = log\u2090(b * c). This allows us to combine the two logarithmic terms on the left-hand side of the equation.\n\n2. **Conversion to Exponential Form:** After combining the logarithms, the equation needs to be converted from logarithmic form to exponential form to solve for 'x'. This involves understanding the relationship between logarithms and exponents.\n\n3. **Quadratic Equation:**  The conversion to exponential form results in a quadratic equation, requiring knowledge of solving quadratic equations to find the values of 'x'.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Combine the logarithms using the identity:**\n   log\u2087(x + 2) + log\u2087(x - 4) = log\u2087((x + 2)(x - 4))\n\n2. **Rewrite the equation, simplifying the right-hand side:**\n   log\u2087(x\u00b2 - 2x - 8) = 1\n\n3. **Convert the logarithmic equation to exponential form:**\n   7\u00b9 = x\u00b2 - 2x - 8 \n\n4. **Rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form:**\n   x\u00b2 - 2x - 15 = 0\n\n5. **Solve for 'x' using factoring or the quadratic formula:**\n   (x - 5)(x + 3) = 0\n   Therefore, x = 5 or x = -3\n\n6. **Check for extraneous solutions:**  Logarithms are only defined for positive arguments. Since log\u2087(-3 - 4) = log\u2087(-7) is undefined, x = -3 is an extraneous solution and must be discarded.\n\n**Therefore, the only valid solution to the equation is x = 5.**",

            "reasoning": "This problem requires careful application of both growth and decay concepts within each 4-hour cycle. Here's how to solve it:\n\n**1. Analyze the growth phase:**\n\n* The population doubles every 4 hours, representing a 100% increase.\n\n**2. Analyze the decline phase:**\n\n* Immediately after doubling, the population decreases by 20%. \n\n**3. Calculate the net growth per cycle:**\n\n* Start with the initial population: 100 bacteria\n* After doubling: 100 * 2 = 200 bacteria\n* After 20% decline: 200 * (1 - 0.20) = 160 bacteria\n* Net increase per cycle: 160 - 100 = 60 bacteria\n* Growth factor per cycle: 160 / 100 = 1.6\n\n**4. Determine the number of cycles:**\n\n* Target population: 1000 bacteria\n* We need to find 'n' in the equation: 100 * (1.6)^n = 1000\n\n**5.
