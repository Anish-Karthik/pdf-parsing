The height of the kite (75 feet) is the opposite side, and the distance from the kite's shadow on the ground to the person holding the string is the adjacent side.\n\n2. **Recall Cotangent:** Remember that cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent:  cot(angle) = adjacent side / opposite side.\n\n3. **Find the Adjacent Side:** We know the opposite side (75 ft) and the angle (60 degrees). We can use the tangent function to find the adjacent side: \n   * tan(60 degrees) = opposite / adjacent \n   * \u221a3 = 75 ft / adjacent\n   * adjacent = 75 ft / \u221a3 \n   * adjacent = 25\u221a3 ft (after rationalizing the denominator)\n\n4. **Calculate Cotangent:** Now we have the adjacent side (25\u221a3 ft) and the opposite side (75 ft).  \n   * cot(60 degrees) = adjacent / opposite\n   * cot(60 degrees) = (25\u221a3 ft) / (75 ft)\n   * cot(60 degrees) = \u221a3 / 3 \n\nTherefore, the cotangent of the angle formed between the string and the horizontal line is \u221a3 / 3.",

            "reasoning": "## Reasoning: \n\n**1. Express z in trigonometric form:**\n\n* Find the modulus of z:  \\( |z| = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{3})^2 + (-1)^2} = 2 \\)\n* Find the argument of z: Since z lies in Quadrant IV, we have \n   \\( \\tan \\theta = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\), so  \\( \\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi \\) (where k is an integer). We'll use \\( \\theta = \\frac{11\\pi}{6} \\) to keep the argument within  \\( [0, 2\\pi) \\).\n* Therefore, \\( z = 2(\\cos(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}) + i \\sin(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}) ) \\).\n\n**2. Calculate z^6 using De Moivre's Theorem:**\n\n* De Moivre's Theorem states: \\( [r(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)]^n = r^n(\\cos(n\\theta) + i\\sin(n\\theta)) \\)\n* Applying this to \\( z^6 \\): \n   \\( z^6 = 2^6 (\\cos(6 \\cdot \\frac{11\\pi}{6}) + i\\sin(6 \\cdot \\frac{11\\pi}{6})) \\) \n   \\( = 64 (\\cos(11\\pi) + i \\sin(11\\pi)) \\) \n   \\( = 64 (\\cos(\\pi) + i \\sin(\\pi)) \\) (Since cosine and sine have a period of \\( 2\\pi \\))\n   \\( = -64 \\) \n\n**3. Find w:**\n\n* We need to find a complex number \\( w \\) such that \\( w^3 = -64 \\).\n*  One solution is the principal cube root of -64: \n    *  The magnitude of \\( w \\) is the cube root of the magnitude of -64, which is 4. \n    *  The argument of \\( w \\) is one-third the argument of -64. Since the argument of -64 is \\( \\pi \\), the argument of \\( w \\) is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\). However, we need the argument of  \\( w \\) to be between  \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\) and \\( \\pi \\). To achieve this, we can add \\( 2\\pi \\) to the argument of -64 before dividing by 3. This gives us an argument of  \\( \\frac{7\\pi}{9} \\) for \\( w \\), which lies within the desired range. \n\n* Therefore, \\( w = 4(\\cos(\\frac{7\\pi}{9}) + i\\sin(\\frac{7\\pi}{9})) \\).\n",

Due to fog, they can only see the lighthouse from two points along their ship's path.  The ship travels 200 meters on a bearing of 30 degrees east of north from point A to point B. From point A, the lighthouse is at a bearing of 10 degrees west of north.  From point B, the lighthouse is at a bearing of 50 degrees west of north. What is the distance from point B to the lighthouse?",

            "reasoning": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis problem requires a combination of Law of Sines and understanding of bearings to solve.\n\n1. **Visualize the Problem:** Sketch a diagram. Represent points A and B with the lighthouse (point L) forming triangle ABL. \n\n2. **Determine the angles of the triangle:**\n    *  Angle ABL: Since AB has a bearing of 30 degrees east of north, and BL is west of north, angle ABL = 30 degrees + 50 degrees = 80 degrees.\n    * Angle BAL:  Bearing of AL is 10 degrees west of north, and AB is 30 degrees east of north, so angle BAL = 10 degrees + 30 degrees = 40 degrees.\n    * Angle ALB: The angles inside a triangle sum to 180 degrees, so angle ALB = 180 degrees - 80 degrees - 40 degrees = 60 degrees.\n\n3. **Apply Law of Sines:** We know AB = 200 meters, and we want to find BL. Using the Law of Sines:\n\n   ```\n   sin(BAL) / BL = sin(ALB) / AB\n   ```\n\n4. **Solve for BL:**\n\n   ```\n   BL = AB * sin(BAL) / sin(ALB) \n   BL = 200 meters * sin(40 degrees) / sin(60 degrees)\n   BL \u2248 143.28 meters\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the distance from point B to the lighthouse is approximately 143.28 meters. \n",
