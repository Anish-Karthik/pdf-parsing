Use the change of base rule:**\n\nThe change of base rule states that log\u2090(b) = log\u2093(b) / log\u2093(a) for any valid base x.\nWe can use this to express log\u2086(648) in terms of either log\u2083 or log\u2082:\n\n* log\u2086(648) = log\u2083(648) / log\u2083(6)\n* log\u2086(648) = log\u2082(648) / log\u2082(6)\n\n**4. Simplify using known logarithm values:**\n\nWe know log\u2083(9) = 2, and since 648 = 9\u00b3 * 2, we have:\n\n* log\u2083(648) = log\u2083(9\u00b3 * 2) = log\u2083(9\u00b3) + log\u2083(2) = 3log\u2083(9) + log\u2083(2) = 6 + log\u2083(2)\n\nSimilarly, we know log\u2082(8) = 3, and since 6 = 2 * 3, we have:\n\n* log\u2082(648) = log\u2082(2 * 3 * 2 * 3 * 2 * 3 * 3) = 1 + log\u2082(3) + 1 + log\u2082(3) + 1 + log\u2082(3) + log\u2082(3) = 3 + 4log\u2082(3)\n\n**5.  Choose the easier path and calculate:**\n\nSince we don't have a direct way to calculate log\u2083(2) or log\u2082(3), we can't get a clean numerical answer. However, we have successfully expressed log\u2086(648) in two different ways using simpler logarithmic terms:\n\n* log\u2086(648) = 6 + log\u2083(2)\n* log\u2086(648) = 3 + 4log\u2082(3)\n\nThis demonstrates an understanding of the logarithm properties and the ability to manipulate them effectively.",

Let the length of the playground be 'l' and the width be 'w'. Using the perimeter formula, we have:\n   100 = 2l + 2w  \n   Simplifying, we get: l + w = 50\n\n2. **Applying AM-GM:** The AM-GM inequality states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is always greater than or equal to their geometric mean. In this case, we can apply it to the numbers 'l' and 'w':\n   (l + w)/2 \u2265 \u221a(l * w)\n\n3. **Relating to Area:** Notice that the right side of the inequality represents the square root of the area (A = l * w). We can rewrite the inequality as:\n   50/2 \u2265 \u221aA\n   25 \u2265 \u221aA\n   Squaring both sides: 625 \u2265 A\n\n4. **Finding Maximum Area:** This tells us that the maximum possible area of the playground is 625 square meters. \n\n5. **Finding Dimensions:**  The maximum area occurs when l = w (equality in AM-GM holds when the numbers are equal). Since l + w = 50, then l = w = 25 meters. \n\nTherefore, the playground with the maximum area will be a square with sides of 25 meters each.",
