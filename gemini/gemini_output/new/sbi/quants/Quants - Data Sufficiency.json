Combine their rates:**\n   * Combined rate: (1/6) + (1/4) = 5/12 of the fence per hour\n\n**3. Calculate combined time:**\n   * Time = Job / Rate\n   * Time = 1 fence / (5/12 fence per hour) = 12/5 hours = 2.4 hours\n\n**Therefore, it will take them 2.4 hours to paint the fence together.**",

Let's represent the width as 'w'. Therefore, the length would be '2w'. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + width). \n\n**2. Setting Up the Equation**\n\nWe know the perimeter is represented by '6x + 12'. So, we can write the equation:\n\n2*(2w + w) = 6x + 12\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n6w = 6x + 12\n\nw = x + 2\n\nSo, the width of the field is 'x + 2'.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Data Sufficiency Statements**\n\n* **Statement 1:** This statement provides information about the area of the field. While related to length and width, it doesn't directly give us a way to determine the width in terms of 'x' alone. Therefore, statement 1 is not sufficient.\n* **Statement 2:** This statement tells us how the perimeter changes if the width is increased. Since the perimeter is directly related to the width, this statement should be sufficient. Let's verify: \n\n   If the width (w) is increased by 2, the new perimeter is 6x + 18. Using the perimeter formula, we have:\n   2 * (2w + 2 + w) = 6x + 18\n   Simplifying: 6w + 4 = 6x + 18\n   6w = 6x + 14\n   w = x + 7/3\n\n   This equation contradicts our earlier finding that w = x + 2.

Since we don't know the individual layer height, we can represent it as 12/x (total height divided by the number of layers).\n* **Inequality:**\n    * We know the total height (12 inches) must be less than or equal to the number of layers (x) times the height of each layer (12/x), so we have the inequality:  12 \u2264 x * (12/x)\n    * Simplifying, we get 12 \u2264 12\n    * Since 12 is always equal to 12, this means x can be any number of layers as long as it results in a cake that's at least 12 inches tall.\n* **Considering the oven height limit:** However, we also know the oven can only bake cakes that are a maximum of 8 inches tall. This means each layer cannot exceed 8 inches. \n* **Revised Inequality:**  To account for the oven height restriction, we need to make sure each layer (12/x) is less than or equal to 8 inches: 12/x \u2264 8\n* **Solving for x:**\n    * Multiply both sides by x: 12 \u2264 8x\n    * Divide both sides by 8: 1.5 \u2264 x \n\n* **Final Inequality:**  Therefore, the inequality representing the possible values of x is x \u2265 1.5.

Since we already have points A (2,3) and B (8,11), the segment AB is one of the diagonals.\n* The midpoint formula is: ((x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2)\n* Applying the formula with A(2,3) and B(8,11): ((2+8)/2, (3+11)/2) = (5,7)\n* Therefore, the park entrance is located at (5,7).\n\n**2. Understanding the Slope Constraint:**\n\n* The other diagonal must have a slope of -2. This means that for every 1 unit you move to the right along this diagonal, you must move 2 units down.\n\n**3. Determining Multiple Possibilities:**\n\n* We don't have enough information to pinpoint the exact coordinates of the other two corners. This is because there are infinitely many lines with a slope of -2.\n* Imagine drawing a line with a slope of -2 passing through the midpoint (5,7). You can rotate this line around the midpoint, and each position would represent a different diagonal, leading to different corner points for the park.\n\n**4. Finding One Possible Set of Coordinates:**\n\n* To find one possible solution, we can choose a point on the line with a slope of -2 passing through (5,7).\n* Let's say we move one unit to the right from the midpoint (5,7). Because the slope is -2, we need to move two units down. This gives us the point (6,5).\n* Now, to find the fourth corner, we can use the fact that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Since (5,7) is the midpoint of the diagonal connecting (6,5) and the fourth corner, we can find the fourth corner by going the same distance from (5,7) in the opposite direction.\n* From (5,7), moving one unit to the left and two units up takes us to (4,9).\n\n**Therefore, one possible set of coordinates for the remaining corners of the park is (6,5) and (4,9).

Calculate the probability of getting two distinct numbers, with at least one odd, using the standard dice alone.**\n\n*   There are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two standard dice.\n*   We can approach this by calculating the probability of the event NOT happening (i.e., getting two even numbers) and subtracting from 1.\n*   There are 3 even numbers on a standard die, so 3 * 3 = 9 outcomes give us two evens.\n*   The probability of NOT getting the desired outcome (two distinct with at least one odd) is 9/36 = 1/4.\n*   Therefore, the probability of getting at least one odd number and one other distinct number with the two standard dice is 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\n**2.  Consider the unusual die.**\n\n*   Notice that the unusual die *always* yields an odd number (1, 3, or 5).\n*   This means the unusual die guarantees we fulfill the 'at least one odd number' condition.\n\n**3.  Determine the probability of the unusual die NOT creating a duplicate.**\n\n*   We already have at least one odd number guaranteed.  We need the unusual die to NOT match whatever the other two dice rolled.\n*   Let's say the two standard dice resulted in a 2 and a 5. The unusual die has a 2/6 (or 1/3) chance of matching the '5'.\n*   Similarly, if the standard dice rolled a 4 and a 4, the unusual die has a 0/6 chance of matching (it cannot roll a '4').\n*   Since we don't know what the standard dice will show, we need the overall probability of the unusual die NOT matching. Given its equal distribution of 1s, 3s, and 5s, there's always a 2/6 (or 1/3) chance of it creating a duplicate.\n*   Therefore, there's a 1 - (1/3) = 2/3 chance the unusual die will NOT create a duplicate.\n\n**4.  Combine the probabilities.**\n\n*   The probability of getting two distinct numbers with at least one odd from the standard dice is 3/4.\n*   The probability of the unusual die NOT creating a duplicate is 2/3.\n*   To get the final probability, we multiply these: (3/4) * (2/3) = 1/2\n\n**Therefore, the probability of winning the prize on a single roll is 1/2.**",
