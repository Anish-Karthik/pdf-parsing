            "difficulty": "easy",
            "reasoning": "This question, while seemingly about bacteria growth, tests the fundamental understanding of geometric mean.  Here's how we solve it: \n\n**1. Identify the pattern:** The bacteria population doubles every hour, meaning it increases by a constant *factor*. This indicates a geometric progression.\n\n**2.  Apply the geometric sequence formula:**  While we could manually calculate the growth for each hour, the geometric sequence formula is more efficient:\n\n   * a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> * r<sup>(n-1)</sup>* \n\n   Where:\n   * a<sub>n</sub> = the nth term (bacteria count after 'n' hours)\n   * a<sub>1</sub> = the first term (initial bacteria count)\n   * r = common ratio (growth factor)\n   * n = number of terms (hours in this case)\n\n**3.  Calculate:**\n   * a<sub>1</sub> = 100 (initial bacteria)\n   * r = 2 (doubles every hour)\n   * n = 3 (we want the count after 3 hours)\n\n   Therefore, a<sub>3</sub> = 100 * 2<sup>(3-1)</sup> = 100 * 2<sup>2</sup> = 100 * 4 = 400\n\n**Answer:** There will be 400 bacteria after 3 hours. \n\n**Why this relates to Geometric Mean:** While we didn't directly calculate the geometric mean, understanding that the growth is a *constant factor* is key. Geometric mean is used when dealing with values that change by a constant factor, making it relevant in situations like population growth, investment returns, etc.",

            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "This question deals with the average of consecutive numbers, which forms an arithmetic series. Here's how to solve it:\n\n**1. Find the number of cupcakes baked on the last day:**\n   - The baker increases his output by 2 cupcakes each day for 7 days, so the total increase is 2 cupcakes/day * 6 days = 12 cupcakes.\n   - On the last day, he bakes 10 cupcakes (initial amount) + 12 cupcakes (increase) = 22 cupcakes.\n\n**2. Calculate the total number of cupcakes baked:**\n   - The average of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term. Therefore, the average number of cupcakes baked per day is (10 cupcakes + 22 cupcakes) / 2 = 16 cupcakes/day.\n   - The total number of cupcakes baked is 16 cupcakes/day * 7 days = 112 cupcakes. \n\n**3. Calculate the average:**\n   - The average number of cupcakes baked per day is the total number of cupcakes baked divided by the number of days: 112 cupcakes / 7 days = 16 cupcakes/day.\n\n**Therefore, the baker bakes an average of 16 cupcakes per day.**",

Here's why it's tricky and requires a deep understanding:\n\n1. **Complex Calculations:** Calculating the daily portfolio returns involves:\n    * Computing the 12-day and 26-day EMAs for each asset daily.\n    * Identifying crossovers to generate buy/sell signals.\n    * Adjusting portfolio weights based on the signals. \n    * Calculating the daily portfolio return based on the adjusted weights and asset price changes.\n2. **Multiple Interpretations:** The question requires comparing the performance of the MACD-based strategy to a benchmark (equal-weighted portfolio). This comparison involves analyzing the effectiveness of the strategy in adding value. \n3. **Non-standard Scenario:** The question uses a dynamic portfolio strategy based on a technical indicator (MACD), which is a more advanced concept than simply calculating and interpreting moving averages in isolation.  \n\n**Solving the Question:**\n\n1. **Calculate EMAs:** For each asset, calculate the 12-day and 26-day EMAs for each of the 60 days. \n2. **Generate Signals:**  Identify the days when the 12-day EMA crosses above or below the 26-day EMA for each asset. These crossovers represent buy and sell signals, respectively.\n3. **Adjust Portfolio Weights:**  On days with buy or sell signals, adjust the portfolio weights according to the strategy rules. For example, if Asset A triggers a buy signal, increase its weight from 1/3 to 0.433 (1/3 + 0.1), and decrease the weights of Assets B and C to 0.283 (1/3 - 0.05).  \n4. **Calculate Daily Portfolio Returns:** For each day, calculate the weighted average return of the three assets using the adjusted portfolio weights. For example, if the daily returns of assets A, B, and C are 1%, -0.5%, and 0.2%, respectively, and the portfolio weights are 0.433, 0.283, and 0.283, then the portfolio return would be (0.433 * 0.01) + (0.283 * -0.005) + (0.283 * 0.002) = 0.30%. \n5. **Calculate Total Returns:** Sum the daily portfolio returns over the 60-day period to get the total return for the MACD-based strategy.\n6. **Benchmark Comparison:** Repeat steps 4 and 5 using equal weights (1/3 each) for the entire period to calculate the return of the equal-weighted portfolio.\n7. **Compare and Analyze:** Compare the total returns of the MACD-based strategy and the equal-weighted portfolio. A higher return for the MACD-based strategy suggests that the strategy was successful in adding value by timing the market based on the MACD indicator. \n",
