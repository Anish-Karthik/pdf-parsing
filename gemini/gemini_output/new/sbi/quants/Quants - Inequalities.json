Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Triangle Inequality:**\nThe Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\n**Applying it to the problem:**\n* Let's call the length of Charlie's stick 'C'.\n* To form a triangle, these three inequalities must hold true:\n    * 5 + 7 > C\n    * 5 + C > 7\n    * 7 + C > 5\n\n* Simplifying the inequalities:\n    * 12 > C \n    * C > 2\n    * C > -2 (This inequality is always true since stick lengths can't be negative)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCharlie's stick length (C) must be greater than 2 and less than 12.

Understanding Rearrangement Inequality:**\n\nThe Rearrangement Inequality states that, given two sequences of real numbers arranged in a specific order, the sum of pairwise products is maximized when the sequences are similarly ordered and minimized when they are oppositely ordered.\n\n**2.

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Set up the inequality:**\n\n* **Area of the garden:** (x + 5)(x - 3)\n* **Perimeter of the garden:** 2(x + 5) + 2(x - 3) = 4x + 4\n* **Ratio of area to perimeter:** [(x + 5)(x - 3)] / (4x + 4)\n\nThe problem states that this ratio must be less than (x + 1):\n\n[(x + 5)(x - 3)] / (4x + 4) < (x + 1)\n\n**2. Simplify and find critical points:**\n\n* Subtract (x + 1) from both sides to get a 0 on the right side:\n[(x + 5)(x - 3)] / (4x + 4) - (x + 1) < 0\n\n* Find a common denominator and simplify:\n[(x + 5)(x - 3) - (x + 1)(4x + 4)] / (4x + 4) < 0\n\n* Expand and combine terms:\n(x\u00b2 + 2x - 15 - 4x\u00b2 - 8x - 4) / (4x + 4) < 0\n(-3x\u00b2 - 6x - 19) / (4x + 4) < 0\n\n* Factor out a -1 from the numerator (optional, for easier factoring):\n(3x\u00b2 + 6x + 19) / (4x + 4) > 0 \n\n* **Critical Points:**\n    * **Numerator:** The quadratic (3x\u00b2 + 6x + 19) has no real roots (the discriminant is negative). This means the expression in the numerator never equals zero.\n    * **Denominator:** 4x + 4 = 0 when x = -1. \n\n**3. Test Intervals:**\n\nWe have one critical point (x = -1) which divides the number line into two intervals:\n\n* **Interval 1:** x < -1\n* **Interval 2:** x > -1\n\nChoose a test value within each interval and substitute it into the simplified inequality  [(3x\u00b2 + 6x + 19) / (4x + 4) > 0] to see if the inequality holds true:\n\n* **Interval 1 (x < -1):** Let's test x = -2. The inequality becomes positive/negative, which is negative. The inequality does not hold.\n* **Interval 2 (x > -1):** Let's test x = 0. The inequality becomes positive/positive, which is positive. The inequality holds. \n\n**4. Express the Solution in Interval Notation:**\n\nThe solution is x > -1.  In interval notation, this is expressed as (-1, \u221e).\n",

Consider extreme cases:**\n\n* **To minimize 'y' (bags of 8):** Assume the farmer donates close to the minimum of 100 apples. To minimize 'y', maximize 'x' (bags of 6). The largest multiple of 6 less than 100 is 96 (6 * 16). This leaves 4 apples unaccounted for.  We can't use a bag of 8 to perfectly fit those. \n\n* **To minimize 'x' (bags of 6):** Assume the farmer donates close to the minimum of 100 apples. The largest multiple of 8 less than 100 is 96 (8 * 12).  This leaves 4 apples unaccounted for, which could be put in one more bag of 6. This gives us a potential solution: x = 1, y = 12, total bags = 13.\n\n**4.

This works!\n\n* Since we are working with whole bags of apples, we can't have fewer than 12 bags of 8 apples if we want to get close to the minimum donation.

            "question": "A robotics engineer is programming a robotic arm to sort objects on a conveyor belt. The arm needs to pick up objects within a specific range of positions along the belt. The ideal position for the arm to pick up an object is 25 cm from a sensor. Due to the sensor's margin of error, the acceptable range for the arm to pick up an object is within 3 cm of the ideal position.  At the same time, to avoid collisions with other machinery, the arm's position, represented by 'x', must be at least 18 cm away from a safety barrier located at a fixed point on the conveyor belt. \n\nThis situation can be represented by the following inequalities: \n\n1. |x - 25| \u2264 3  (representing the acceptable pick-up range)\n2. |x - b| \u2265 18 (representing the safety constraint, where 'b' is the unknown position of the safety barrier)\n\nIf the safety barrier's position ('b') needs to be as close as possible to the ideal pick-up position (25 cm) while still satisfying both inequalities, what is the smallest possible whole number value of 'b'?",

            "reasoning": "**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Inequality 1:**  |x - 25| \u2264 3  means the robotic arm can pick up objects within 3 cm to the left or right of the ideal position (25 cm). This gives us a range of 22 cm to 28 cm for acceptable pick-up positions.\n* **Inequality 2:** |x - b| \u2265 18 means the arm's position ('x') must be at least 18 cm away from the safety barrier's position ('b').\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Solving Inequality 1:**\n   - |x - 25| \u2264 3 can be broken down into two separate inequalities:\n      * x - 25 \u2264 3  \n      * -(x - 25) \u2264 3\n   - Solving these inequalities, we get:\n      * x \u2264 28\n      * x \u2265 22\n   - This confirms the acceptable pick-up range is 22 cm \u2264 x \u2264 28 cm.\n\n2. **Analyzing Inequality 2:** \n   -  We want to find the smallest value of 'b' that maintains a distance of at least 18 cm from any point within the acceptable pick-up range (22 cm \u2264 x \u2264 28 cm).\n\n3. **Finding the Closest 'b' Value:**\n   - To be as close as possible to the ideal pick-up position (25 cm),  we need to consider placing 'b' either to the left or right of the acceptable pick-up range.\n   - **Placing 'b' to the left:** To maintain a distance of at least 18 cm from the leftmost acceptable pick-up position (x = 22 cm), the smallest possible value for 'b' would be 22 - 18 = 4 cm. However, this would place the barrier too close to the ideal pick-up position and potentially interfere with the arm's operation. \n   - **Placing 'b' to the right:**  To maintain a distance of at least 18 cm from the rightmost acceptable pick-up position (x = 28 cm), the smallest possible value for 'b' would be 28 + 18 = 46 cm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe smallest possible whole number value for 'b', the position of the safety barrier, is 46 cm. This ensures the robotic arm can safely pick up objects within its acceptable range while avoiding collisions with the barrier.",

Plan B charges a flat fee of $30 per month for unlimited text messages and $8 per gigabyte of data used.  For how many gigabytes of data used in a month would Plan A be cheaper than Plan B, assuming the user always sends enough texts to reach the maximum cost of Plan A?",
            "difficulty": "medium",
            "reasoning": "Let 'x' represent the number of gigabytes of data used in a month.  We first need to determine the maximum data allowance under Plan A to reach the $50 cap. Since the text messages cost a maximum of $0.10 * x, the remaining amount for data is $50 - ($0.10 * x). This amount can buy ($50 - ($0.10 * x)) / $5 gigabytes of data. To find when Plan A is cheaper, we need to identify when the cost of Plan A (always $50 when maximizing text messages) is less than the cost of Plan B, which is $30 + $8x.  Therefore, the inequality to solve is: $50 < $30 + $8x. \n\n Solving for x:\n 1. Subtract $30 from both sides:  $20 < $8x \n 2. Divide both sides by $8: 2.5 < x \n\n This means Plan A is cheaper when the data usage exceeds 2.5 gigabytes per month. However, we need to consider the maximum data allowed under Plan A's $50 limit. Assuming the user sends enough texts to reach the monthly cap, they have $50 - $0.10x to spend on data.  We need to find the maximum value of x for which ($50 - ($0.10 * x)) / $5 > 2.5. \n\nSolving for x: \n1. Multiply both sides by $5: $50 - ($0.10 * x) > $12.50 \n2. Subtract $50 from both sides: -($0.10 * x) > -$37.50\n3. Divide both sides by -$0.10 (and remember to flip the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number): x < 375 \n\nThis indicates that Plan A's $50 limit allows for a maximum of 375 GB of data. \n\nTherefore, considering both the data usage at which Plan A becomes cheaper and the maximum data allowed under Plan A, Plan A is cheaper than Plan B when data usage is between 2.5 GB and 375 GB.",
