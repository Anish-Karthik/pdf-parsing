This means the y\u00b2 term will be positive in the standard equation.\n\nThe distance from the center to each vertex is 'a' = 4. Therefore, a\u00b2 = 16.\n\nThe slopes of the asymptotes for a vertically oriented hyperbola are \u00b1(a/b). Given the slopes are \u00b12, we have a/b = 2. With 'a' being 4, we solve for 'b':  4/b = 2 => b = 2, so b\u00b2 = 4.\n\nThe standard equation for a vertically oriented hyperbola centered at the origin is (y\u00b2/a\u00b2) - (x\u00b2/b\u00b2) = 1.

Here's how to solve it:\n\n1. **Find the equations of Road 3 and Road 4:**\n    * **Road 3:** Since it's parallel to Road 1, it has the same slope (m=2). Using the point-slope form with the point (3,1), we get the equation y - 1 = 2(x - 3), which simplifies to y = 2x - 5.\n    * **Road 4:** It's perpendicular to Road 2, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of -0.5, which is 2. Using the point-slope form with the point (-2, 6), we get y - 6 = 2(x + 2), simplifying to y = 2x + 10.\n\n2. **Find the vertices of the park:** This involves solving systems of equations formed by the intersection points of the roads:\n    * **Road 1 & Road 2:** Solve y = 2x + 5 and y = -0.5x + 8 to get (1.2, 7.4)\n    * **Road 1 & Road 4:** Solve y = 2x + 5 and y = 2x + 10. These lines are parallel, indicating that the park is a trapezoid, not a parallelogram.\n    * **Road 2 & Road 3:** Solve y = -0.5x + 8 and y = 2x - 5 to get (2.6, 6.7)\n    * **Road 3 & Road 4:** Solve y = 2x - 5 and y = 2x + 10 (parallel lines, confirming the trapezoid shape)\n\n3. **Determine the critical distances:**\n    * **Height of the trapezoid:**  This is the perpendicular distance between Road 1 (or Road 3) and Road 2 (or Road 4).  We can use the formula for the distance between a point and a line.  Let's take point (1.2, 7.4) on Road 1 and Road 2's equation (y = -0.5x + 8, rewritten as 0.5x + y - 8 = 0):\n        * Distance = |(0.5 * 1.2) + (1 * 7.4) - 8| / sqrt(0.5\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = 2.4 / sqrt(1.25) = 2.15 (approx)\n\n4. **Inscribed Circle:**\n    * In a trapezoid, the diameter of the inscribed circle is equal to the height of the trapezoid.\n    * Therefore, the diameter of the fountain is approximately 2.15 units.\n\n5. **Calculate the area of the fountain:**\n    * Radius = Diameter / 2 = 2.15 / 2 = 1.075\n    * Area = \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 \u2248 \u03c0 * (1.075)\u00b2 \u2248 3.63 square units\n\nTherefore, the area of the fountain is approximately 3.63 square units.",

            "reasoning": "## Reasoning:\n\n**Part a)**\n\n1. **Understanding the Definition:** The given definition is the geometric definition of a parabola. The line y = -2 is the directrix, and the point F(1, 2) is the focus.\n\n2. **Finding the Vertex:** The vertex (h, k) of the parabola is the midpoint of the segment connecting the focus and the directrix's point closest to the focus.  The directrix's point closest to (1, 2) is (1, -2). Therefore, the vertex is ((1+1)/2, (2-2)/2) = (1, 0). \n\n3. **Determining 'p':**  'p' is the distance between the vertex and the focus (or the vertex and the directrix). In this case, p = 2.\n\n4. **Parabola's Orientation:** Since the focus is above the directrix, the parabola opens upwards. This means the standard equation will be of the form (x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k). \n\n5. **Final Equation:** Plugging in the values for h, k, and p, we get the equation of the parabola:  **(x - 1)^2 = 8y**\n\n**Part b)**\n\n1. **Equation of the Line:** The line passing through F(1, 2) with a slope of 3 is given by y - 2 = 3(x - 1), which simplifies to y = 3x - 1.\n\n2. **Points of Intersection:**  Substitute y = 3x - 1 into the parabola's equation: (x - 1)^2 = 8(3x - 1). This simplifies to x^2 - 22x + 9 = 0.\n\n3. **Solving the Quadratic:** Solve the quadratic equation to find the x-coordinates of the intersection points A and B. Let the x-coordinates be x1 and x2. \n\n4. **Distance Formula:**  Find the corresponding y-coordinates using the line's equation (y = 3x - 1).  Then, use the distance formula to find the length of AB:  AB = \u221a[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. Since y = 3x - 1, we can substitute to get AB = \u221a[(x2 - x1)^2 + (3x2 - 3x1)^2] = \u221a[10(x2 - x1)^2] = \u221a10 |x2 - x1|. \n\n5. **Simplifying with the Quadratic Formula:** Recall that for a quadratic ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the difference of roots is given by \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)/|a|. In our case, this becomes  \u221a(22^2 - 4 * 1 * 9)/1 = \u221a448 = 4\u221a28 = 8\u221a7. Therefore, AB = \u221a10 * 8\u221a7 = 8\u221a70. \n\n**Therefore, the answer to part a) is (x - 1)^2 = 8y, and the answer to part b) is 8\u221a70.**",

            "reasoning": "## Reasoning:\n\n**1. Define Variables:**\n* Let 'x' represent the number of minutes used for calls.\n* Let 'y' represent the total monthly cost of the plan.\n\n**2. Formulate Equations:**\n* **Plan A:**  y = 0.05x + 10\n* **Plan B:**  y = 0.025x + 15\n\n**3.  Graphing the Equations:**\n* **To graph each equation, we'll find two points:**\n    * For x = 0 (no calls), find the y-intercept.\n    * Choose another value for x (e.g., x = 100 minutes) and calculate the corresponding y value.\n* **Plan A:**\n    * (0, 10)  (y-intercept)\n    * (100, 15)\n* **Plan B:**\n    * (0, 15) (y-intercept)\n    * (100, 17.5) \n* Plot these points on the coordinate plane and draw a line through them for each plan.\n\n**4. Finding the Point of Intersection:**\n* The point where the two lines intersect represents the call time and cost at which both plans are equal. To find this point, we can solve the system of equations:\n    0.05x + 10 = 0.025x + 15\n    0.025x = 5\n    x = 200 minutes \n* Substitute x = 200 into either equation to find the corresponding cost (y = 20). The point of intersection is (200, 20).\n\n**5. Shading the Region for Plan A as a Better Deal:**\n*  For call times less than 200 minutes, observe which line is lower on the graph.  The lower line represents the cheaper plan. In this case, Plan A's line is below Plan B's line for x < 200.  Shade this region to indicate when Plan A is more cost-effective.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth plans cost the same ($20) at 200 minutes of call time.  Plan A is a better deal for call times less than 200 minutes.",
