Therefore, Speed of truck * (t+1) + 60 km = D\n\n**Step 4:  Solve for the speed of the truck.**\n\n* We have two equations:\n    * Speed of truck * t = 40 + 60t  \n    * Speed of truck * (t+1) + 60 km = D \n* Since we are interested in the speed of the truck, we need to eliminate 't' and 'D'. \n* Notice that we can express 'D' in terms of the car's journey. The car travels from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM (2 hours) at 60 km/h, covering a total distance of 120 km. Therefore, D = 120 km.\n* Substituting D in the second equation: Speed of truck * (t+1) + 60 km = 120 km\n* Simplifying the above equation: Speed of truck * (t+1) = 60 km\n* Now we have two equations:\n    * Speed of truck * t = 40 + 60t\n    * Speed of truck * (t+1) = 60\n* Dividing the second equation by the first equation, we get: (t+1)/t = 60/(40+60t)\n* Solving for 't', we get: t = 2/3 hours\n* Substituting 't' in the equation Speed of truck * t = 40 + 60t, we get:\n    * Speed of truck * (2/3) = 40 + 60*(2/3)\n    * Speed of truck = 100 km/h\n\nTherefore, the speed of the truck is 100 km/h.",

Calculate the time taken for each lap:**\n   - Time = Distance / Speed\n   - Calculate the time taken by both Alice and Bob for each lap until Bob's speed surpasses Alice's.\n\n**4.  Determine the relative distance covered per lap:**\n   - Relative distance = (Bob's speed - Alice's speed) * Time taken for that lap\n   - Keep calculating the relative distance covered by Bob each lap.\n\n**5. Identify the overtaking lap:**\n   - Bob will overtake Alice in the lap where the cumulative relative distance equals or exceeds the track length (400 meters).\n\n**Let's calculate:**\n\n- Bob's speed surpasses Alice's in Lap 6 (12 + 0.5 * 5 = 14.5 m/s).\n- We need to calculate the time taken by both for the first 5 laps and then for lap 6 to find when Bob overtakes.\n\n| Lap | Bob's Speed (m/s) | Alice's Speed (m/s) | Bob's Time (s) | Alice's Time (s) | Relative Speed (m/s) | Relative Distance (m) |\n|-----|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|\n| 1   | 12                | 15                  | 33.33          | 26.67          | -3                  | -100                 |\n| 2   | 12.5               | 15                  | 32            | 26.67          | -2.5                | -80                  |\n| 3   | 13                | 15                  | 30.77          | 26.67          | -2                  | -61.54               |\n| 4   | 13.5               | 15                  | 29.63          | 26.67          | -1.5                | -44.44               |\n| 5   | 14                | 15                  | 28.57          | 26.67          | -1                  | -28.57               |\n| 6   | 14.5               | 15                  | 27.59          | 26.67          | -0.5                | -13.79               |\n\n-  Total relative distance covered by Bob in 6 laps = -324.34 meters (He is behind Alice)\n-  In lap 7, Bob's speed is 15 m/s, same as Alice. So, he won't be able to overtake her.\n-  Therefore, Bob will not be able to overtake Alice within 8 laps.\n\n",
