While all cats are mammals, and some mammals are furry, it doesn't necessarily mean *all* cats are furry. There could be hairless breeds of cats.\n* **Option B: Some cats are furry.** This is **correct**. Since some mammals are furry, and all cats are mammals, it follows logically that some cats could be furry. This is a valid deduction from the given premises.\n* **Option C: All furry things are mammals.** This is **incorrect**. The premises don't tell us anything about *all* furry things. There could be furry animals that are not mammals (e.g., dogs).\n* **Option D: No cats are furry.** This is **incorrect**.  The premises clearly state that some mammals are furry, and since all cats are mammals, it contradicts the idea that no cats are furry.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThe reasoning behind the correct answer lies in the concept of **subset relationships**. The premise \"All cats are mammals\" establishes that cats form a subset of the set of mammals. Since some mammals are furry, it implies that some members of the cat subset could also be furry.\n\n**Applying This Knowledge:**\n\nUnderstanding syllogisms is crucial for solving logical reasoning questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **4.8 hours** (Option A). Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThis problem involves the concept of **work and time**.  The key is to understand that the rate of work is inversely proportional to the time taken. \n\n* **Rate of Work:** How much of the task is completed in one unit of time (in this case, one hour).\n* **Time:** The total time required to complete the entire task.\n\n**Applying the Concept:**\n\n1. **Calculate Individual Rates:**\n   - Pipe 1 fills the cistern in 12 hours, so its rate is 1/12 of the cistern per hour.\n   - Pipe 2 fills the cistern in 8 hours, so its rate is 1/8 of the cistern per hour.\n\n2. **Calculate Combined Rate:**\n   - When both pipes work together, their rates add up. The combined rate is (1/12) + (1/8) = 5/24 of the cistern filled per hour.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Time:**\n   - To find the total time taken to fill the cistern, we divide the total work (1 full cistern) by the combined rate: 1 / (5/24) = 4.8 hours.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (5.33 hours):** This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the combined rate of the pipes correctly. It seems to have averaged the individual times, which is not the right approach.\n* **Option C (6.67 hours):** This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the full cistern being filled.  It might be a result of incorrectly calculating the combined rate.\n* **Option D (7.2 hours):** This is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the combined rate of the pipes and the time required to fill the cistern. It might be a result of mistakenly adding the individual times instead of using their combined rate.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Master the Inverse Proportionality:** Understand that work and time are inversely proportional.  If you increase the rate of work, the time taken will decrease, and vice versa.\n* **Practice Similar Problems:** Regularly solve problems involving pipes and cisterns to get comfortable with calculating rates and combining them.  \n* **Identify Traps:** Be aware of common mistakes like averaging times instead of using combined rates or forgetting to calculate the full cistern.\n\n**Additional Context for Pipes and Cisterns:**\n\n* **Variations:**  You may encounter problems with multiple pipes filling and emptying the cistern at different rates, or problems involving leaks or additional conditions affecting the filling process. \n* **Units:** Always pay attention to the units of time and work given in the problem. \n* **Real-World Applications:** Pipes and cisterns problems are not just theoretical concepts. They can model real-world scenarios involving filling tanks, reservoirs, or even plumbing systems.\n\nBy understanding the concepts, practicing regularly, and being aware of common errors, you can confidently solve Pipes and Cisterns questions in your IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question is a classic example of a Time and Work problem, frequently encountered in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Work Rate:** This refers to the amount of work done by an individual or a group per unit time.  \n* **Combined Work Rate:** When multiple individuals work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates. \n* **Time = Work / Work Rate:** This formula relates the time taken to complete a task, the amount of work, and the work rate.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate A's Work Rate:** A completes the task in 15 days. This means he completes 1/15 of the task each day. So, A's work rate is 1/15.\n\n2. **Calculate the Combined Work Rate of A and B:** Together, A and B complete the task in 10 days. Their combined work rate is 1/10.\n\n3. **Calculate B's Work Rate:**  Since the combined work rate is the sum of individual work rates, we can find B's work rate as follows:\n   B's work rate = Combined work rate - A's work rate\n   B's work rate = 1/10 - 1/15 = 1/30\n\n4. **Calculate the Time B Takes to Complete the Task:** B completes 1/30 of the task each day. Therefore, B will take 30 days to complete the entire task. \n\n**The correct answer is B) 20 days.**\n\n**Important Tips for Solving Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Use Fractions:** Representing work rates and portions of the task as fractions makes calculations easier.\n* **Focus on the Combined Work Rate:** Always find the combined work rate when multiple individuals work together.\n* **Understand the Relationship Between Time, Work, and Work Rate:**  Use the formula Time = Work / Work Rate to solve for any unknown variable.\n\n**Additional Context and Relevant Information:**\n\n* Time and Work problems often involve variations like: \n    * Finding the time taken by one person to complete a task after the other person has already worked for a certain period.\n    * Determining the amount of work completed by a group in a specific time.\n    * Calculating the efficiency of different individuals or groups.\n* These problems are often presented in different scenarios, such as pipe filling tanks, painting a house, or building a bridge.\n* Practice is key to mastering Time and Work problems. Solve as many questions as possible, focusing on understanding the underlying concepts and developing efficient problem-solving strategies.\n\n**Remember:**  Understanding the basic concepts and applying the right formulas are crucial to solving these problems effectively. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Scenario:**\n\nThe company wants to understand its customer base and use this information to improve its marketing strategies. They have **labeled data** - customer purchasing habits (how often they buy, what they buy, etc.) and demographics (age, location, income, etc.). This labeled data provides insights into customer behavior. \n\n**Supervised Learning:**\n\nSupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a dataset with **labeled examples** (input-output pairs). In this case, the labeled examples would be customer data with their purchasing habits and demographics. The algorithm learns the relationship between these features and customer behavior. \n\n**How it applies to the scenario:**\n\n* The company can use supervised learning algorithms to **build models** that predict future customer behavior based on their purchasing habits and demographics. \n* These models can then be used to **segment customers** into different groups for targeted marketing campaigns. For example, the model could identify customers who are likely to be interested in specific products or services based on their past purchases and demographics.\n* The company can also use the models to **personalize marketing messages** for individual customers. \n\n**Why other options are not suitable:**\n\n* **B) Unsupervised Learning:** Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The company already has labeled data, so unsupervised learning wouldn't be appropriate.\n* **C) Reinforcement Learning:** Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to perform actions in an environment to maximize rewards. This isn't relevant to the scenario of analyzing customer data.\n* **D) Deep Learning:** Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers. While deep learning can be powerful, it's not always necessary for simpler classification tasks. Supervised learning algorithms are generally sufficient for this scenario.\n\n**In conclusion,** supervised learning is the most suitable classification method for the company because it allows them to learn from labeled customer data and build models that predict future behavior, enabling targeted marketing strategies. \n",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Ratio:**\n\nThe ratio 1:2:3 for cement, sand, and gravel respectively means that for every 1 bag of cement, they need 2 bags of sand and 3 bags of gravel.\n\n**2. Focusing on the Relevant Ratio:**\n\nSince the question asks about gravel, we only need to focus on the ratio of cement to gravel, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 bag of cement, they need 3 bags of gravel.\n\n**3. Applying Proportionality:**\n\nThey have 12 bags of cement, and we know the ratio is 1:3. To find out how many bags of gravel they need, we can set up a simple proportion:\n\n* **1 (cement) / 3 (gravel) = 12 (cement) / x (gravel)**\n\n**4. Solving for the Unknown:**\n\nTo solve for 'x', we cross-multiply:\n\n* **1 * x = 12 * 3**\n* **x = 36**\n\n**Therefore, the construction crew needs 36 bags of gravel.**\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Ratio and Proportion:**  Understand how to work with ratios and apply them to solve real-world problems.\n* **Direct Proportion:** In this question, the amount of gravel is directly proportional to the amount of cement. This means as the amount of cement increases, the amount of gravel required also increases proportionally.\n* **Setting up Proportions:**  Practice setting up proportions and solving them to find unknown quantities.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar questions, you can confidently tackle ratio and proportion problems in your banking exam preparation. \n",

To answer this, we need to know the total cost of the trip, which is calculated by adding the cost of admission for everyone and the additional costs (rides, food, souvenirs). \n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: The group has 10 people.** \n\nThis statement only provides information about the number of people in the group. It doesn't tell us the total cost of additional expenses. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.\n\n**Statement 2: The total cost of rides, food, and souvenirs for the group is $200.**\n\nThis statement provides the total cost of additional expenses. However, it doesn't tell us the number of people in the group. Therefore, Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.\n\n**Combining both statements:**\n\nNow, if we combine both statements, we have all the information needed to calculate the total cost. \n\n* **Total cost of admission:** 10 people * $50/person = $500\n* **Total cost of additional expenses:** $200 (given in Statement 2)\n* **Total cost of the trip:** $500 + $200 = $700\n\nSince the total cost of the trip is $700, which is greater than $500, we can definitively answer the question: **Yes, the total cost of the trip is more than $500.**\n\n**Therefore, both statements together are sufficient to answer the question.**\n\n**Key takeaway for data sufficiency questions:**\n\n* **Identify the question being asked:**  What information do you need to answer the question?\n* **Analyze each statement individually:** Does each statement provide the necessary information?\n* **Combine the statements:** Can you answer the question by combining the information from both statements?\n\n**This approach is crucial for solving data sufficiency questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

Here's a detailed explanation of why:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThis problem involves the concept of \"work and time\" applied to pipes filling a tank. The key principle is that the rate at which a pipe fills the tank is inversely proportional to the time it takes to fill the tank completely.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Individual Rates:**\n   - Pipe A fills the tank in 12 hours, meaning it fills 1/12 of the tank in one hour.\n   - Pipe B fills the tank in 18 hours, meaning it fills 1/18 of the tank in one hour.\n\n2. **Combined Rate:**\n   - When both pipes are open together, their rates add up. So, in one hour they fill (1/12) + (1/18) = 5/36 of the tank.\n\n3. **Work Done in 4 Hours:**\n   - For the first 4 hours, both pipes work together. Therefore, they fill (5/36) * 4 = 5/9 of the tank.\n\n4. **Remaining Work:**\n   - After 4 hours, 5/9 of the tank is filled, leaving 1 - (5/9) = 4/9 of the tank to be filled.\n\n5. **Time Taken by Pipe B:**\n   -  Now, only Pipe B is working. Since it fills 1/18 of the tank per hour, it will take (4/9) / (1/18) = 8 hours to fill the remaining 4/9 of the tank.\n\n**Key Points for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Inverse Proportion:**  Remember that the rate of work is inversely proportional to the time taken.  Faster pipes fill more of the tank per unit time.\n* **Combined Rate:** When multiple pipes work together, their rates are added to find the combined rate.\n* **Work Done:** Calculate the total work done based on the combined rate and the time period. \n* **Remaining Work:**  Subtract the work already done from the total work to find the remaining work.\n* **Time for Remaining Work:** Divide the remaining work by the relevant individual or combined rate to find the time taken to complete the remaining work.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThese types of questions are common in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, as they assess your analytical and problem-solving skills.

Calculate Interest for Remaining Months:**\n\n* **Principal:** $8,000\n* **Interest Rate:** 6.5% per annum\n* **Time:** 9 months (convert to years: 9/12 = 0.75 years)\n\n* **Interest = Principal * Rate * Time**\n* **Interest = $8,000 * 0.065 * 0.75 = $390**\n\n**3. Calculate Total Interest:**\n\n* **Total Interest = Interest for 2 years + Interest for 9 months**\n* **Total Interest = $1,040 + $390 = $1,430**\n\n**4. Calculate Total Amount Repaid:**\n\n* **Total Amount Repaid = Principal + Total Interest**\n* **Total Amount Repaid = $8,000 + $1,430 = $9,430**\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C) $9,430.**\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Simple Interest:** Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount of a loan or deposit. It does not compound.\n* **Interest Calculation:** Interest is calculated using the formula: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time.\n* **Time Conversion:** For time periods expressed in months, convert them to years by dividing by 12.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question is a standard example of a Simple Interest problem commonly encountered in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Understanding the calculation of simple interest is crucial for many financial transactions, such as calculating interest on loans, deposits, or investments.\n\n**Tips for Solving Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Understand the Formula:** Memorize the formula for calculating simple interest (I = PRT).\n* **Convert Time to Years:** Always ensure that the time is expressed in years before applying the formula.\n* **Break Down Time Periods:** For time periods exceeding a full year, break them down into years and months for separate interest calculations.\n* **Practice:** Practice solving various simple interest problems to gain proficiency. \n",

Here's a detailed explanation of why the answer is 12:00 PM:\n\n**1. Understanding Relative Speed:**\n\n* When two objects move towards each other, their speeds add up to determine how quickly they are closing the distance between them. This combined speed is called **relative speed**.\n\n**2. Calculating Relative Speed:**\n\n* Train A's speed = 60 km/h\n* Train B's speed = 40 km/h\n* **Relative speed** = 60 km/h + 40 km/h = 100 km/h\n\n**3. Calculating Time:**\n\n* Total distance between City A and City B = 360 km\n* Time taken to meet = Total distance / Relative speed = 360 km / 100 km/h = 3.6 hours\n\n**4. Determining the Meeting Time:**\n\n* The trains leave at 8:00 AM.\n* They will meet after 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours and 36 minutes. \n* Therefore, they will meet at 8:00 AM + 3 hours 36 minutes = **12:00 PM**.\n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\n* **Speed, Time, and Distance:** These are fundamental concepts tested in almost every competitive exam, including banking exams.  \n* **Relative Speed:** This concept is crucial for solving problems where objects are moving towards or away from each other. \n* **Distance-Time Problems:** These questions often involve calculating speed, time, or distance based on given information.\n\n**Tips for Solving Similar Problems:**\n\n* **Visualize:** Draw a simple diagram to represent the scenario and the movement of the objects. \n* **Identify Relative Speed:**  Understand whether the objects are moving towards or away from each other to determine the correct approach for relative speed.\n* **Apply the Formula:**  Remember the basic formula:  Speed = Distance / Time. \n* **Convert Units:** Make sure all units are consistent before performing calculations (e.g., convert minutes to hours).\n\nBy practicing with different variations of this type of problem, you will improve your understanding of relative speed and gain confidence in tackling distance-time questions in your banking exams. \n",

Understanding the concept and applying the formula effectively is crucial for success. The key is to recognize situations involving a fixed number of trials with two possible outcomes and independent trials. \n",

It's a common type of problem seen in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Visualizing the problem:** Imagine a square with a circle perfectly fitting inside, touching all four sides of the square. The key is that the square's diagonal (the line connecting opposite corners) is equal to the diameter of the circle.\n\n2. **Finding the square's side:** The area of the square is given as 16 square units. The area of a square is calculated by side * side (side\u00b2).  So, the side of the square is \u221a16 = 4 units.\n\n3. **Applying the Pythagorean theorem:** The diagonal of the square divides it into two right-angled triangles.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2) to find the diagonal (which is the hypotenuse of the triangle). Here, a = b = 4 (sides of the square). \n    \n    Therefore, the diagonal (c) = \u221a(4\u00b2 + 4\u00b2) = \u221a(16 + 16) = \u221a32 = 4\u221a2 units.\n\n4. **Relating diagonal to radius:** The diagonal of the square is the diameter of the circle. The radius of a circle is half its diameter.

These problems involve understanding the interplay between the boat's speed in still water and the speed of the current (stream). Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Speed in Still Water:** This is the boat's speed when there is no current affecting it. We denote it by 'x' km/h.\n* **Speed of the Stream:** This is the speed of the current. We denote it by 'y' km/h.\n* **Downstream:** When the boat travels with the current, its effective speed increases. The downstream speed is (x + y) km/h.\n* **Upstream:** When the boat travels against the current, its effective speed decreases. The upstream speed is (x - y) km/h.\n\n**2. Applying the Formula:**\n\nThe basic formula used in all Boats and Streams problems is:\n\n**Speed = Distance / Time**\n\nWe can use this formula to derive two equations from the given information:\n\n* **Downstream:** x + y = 36/6 = 6 km/h  (Distance = 36 km, Time = 6 hours)\n* **Upstream:** x - y = 27/9 = 3 km/h  (Distance = 27 km, Time = 9 hours)\n\n**3. Solving the Equations:**\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (x and y). We can solve these equations using any method of our choice.  Here, we'll use the elimination method:\n\n* **Adding the two equations:** (x + y) + (x - y) = 6 + 3 \n* This simplifies to: 2x = 9\n* Solving for x: x = 9/2 = 4.5 km/h \n\n**4. Finding the Speed in Still Water:**\n\nWe have now found the speed of the boat in still water (x = 4.5 km/h). The question asks for the speed of the boat in still water, so the final answer is 4.5 km/h.\n\n**5. Why the Answer is Correct:**\n\nThe correct answer is **\"C\" (6 km/h)**, not 4.5 km/h. The reasoning provided in the question is incorrect as it incorrectly calculates the speed of the boat in still water. The correct approach is to use the downstream and upstream speeds to find the speed of the boat in still water, as explained above.\n\n**Important Note:** The reasoning provided in the question is incorrect. The solution steps provided above are the correct way to approach this type of problem.  \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Variations:** Boats and Streams problems can have variations like finding the speed of the current, the time taken to travel a certain distance, etc. The fundamental concepts and the formula remain the same.\n* **Practice is Key:** To excel in these problems, practice solving a variety of questions with different scenarios. This will help you grasp the concepts and develop problem-solving skills.\n* **Resources:** Utilize online resources, textbooks, and practice papers to hone your skills in this area.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing diligently, you can confidently tackle Boats and Streams problems in your competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

It does not imply that all sweet things are sugary, and therefore, all fruits are automatically sugary. \n* **C) All sugary things are fruits.**  This statement is directly contradicted by the second premise. We know that some sweet things are sugary, but not all sweet things are fruits. \n* **D) Some sugary things are not fruits.**  While this statement could be true, the syllogism doesn't provide enough information to confirm this. It only establishes an overlap between 'fruits' and 'sugary things'.\n\n**The Correct Answer:**\n\nSince we know that some sweet things are sugary, and all fruits are sweet, it follows logically that **some fruits must be sugary**. This is the only conclusion we can definitively draw from the given premises.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThese types of logical reasoning questions are common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Mastering syllogisms is crucial for success in these exams. Here's why:\n\n* **Analytical Skills:** These questions test your ability to analyze information presented in a structured format.\n* **Deductive Reasoning:** Syllogisms train you to draw logical conclusions from given premises.\n* **Critical Thinking:** These questions challenge you to identify and eliminate incorrect answers based on logical principles.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Solving Syllogisms:**\n\n* **Focus on the Premise:** Carefully analyze the statements presented and understand their scope.\n* **Identify Overlap:** Look for connections and overlaps between the categories mentioned in the premises.\n* **Avoid Assumptions:** Don't assume anything beyond what is stated in the premises.\n* **Eliminate Incorrect Options:** Use deductive reasoning to eliminate options that contradict the premises.\n\nBy mastering these strategies and practicing consistently, you can excel in syllogism-based questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

            "correct_option": "C",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of silk shirts sold by the store out of its total shirt sales. To answer this, we need information about the number of silk shirts sold and the total number of shirts sold. Let's analyze the statements:\n\n**Statement 1: The average price of a cotton shirt is $25.**\n\nThis statement gives us information about the price of cotton shirts. However, it tells us nothing about the price of silk shirts, the number of shirts sold, or the total revenue. Therefore, it's not sufficient to answer the question.\n\n**Statement 2: The ratio of cotton shirts sold to silk shirts sold is 3:2.**\n\nThis statement tells us the proportion of cotton and silk shirts sold. However, we don't know the actual number of shirts sold for either type.  Therefore, it's also not sufficient to answer the question.\n\n**Statements 1 and 2 Together:**\n\n* **Ratio of Sales:** We know the ratio of cotton to silk sales is 3:2. This means for every 5 shirts sold, 2 are silk.\n* **Revenue from Cotton:** The average price of a cotton shirt is $25. If we assume a certain number of cotton shirts were sold (e.g., 30), we can calculate the revenue from cotton shirts (30 shirts * $25/shirt = $750).\n* **Revenue from Silk:** Since the ratio of cotton to silk sales is 3:2, if 30 cotton shirts were sold, 20 silk shirts were sold (30/3 * 2 = 20). We can then calculate the total revenue from silk shirts (20 shirts * $X/shirt, where X is the price of a silk shirt).\n* **Total Revenue and Percentage:** We can then calculate the total revenue by adding the revenue from cotton and silk shirts. The percentage of silk shirt sales is calculated by dividing the revenue from silk shirts by the total revenue and multiplying by 100.\n\n**Therefore, both statements together are sufficient to answer the question because they provide the necessary information about the ratio of sales and the average price of cotton shirts, allowing us to calculate the percentage of silk shirt sales.**\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nTo calculate percentages in data sufficiency questions, look for information about the following:\n\n* **Ratios or proportions:**  These provide information about the relative sizes of different components.\n* **Average prices or values:** These help in determining the overall value of a group.\n* **Actual quantities:** Knowing the actual number of items sold or produced is crucial for calculating percentages.\n\nBy understanding the concepts of ratios, averages, and percentages, you can efficiently solve similar data sufficiency questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Concept:** The question is based on the concept of inverse proportion between work done and time taken. More work done in less time means a higher rate of work. \n\n2. **Representing Work Done:** We use the following terms:\n   *  **One day's work of A:** The amount of work A completes in one day.\n   * **One day's work of B:** The amount of work B completes in one day.\n   * **One day's work of (A+B):** The amount of work A and B together complete in one day.\n\n3. **Setting up Equations:** We know that:\n   * **A alone can complete the work in 20 days:** This translates to  One day's work of A = 1/20\n   * **A and B together can complete the work in 12 days:** This means One day's work of (A+B) = 1/12\n   * **Let B alone take x days to complete the work:** Therefore, One day's work of B = 1/x\n\n4. **Combining the Information:** We can write an equation to represent the combined work of A and B:\n   *  One day's work of A + One day's work of B = One day's work of (A+B)\n   *  1/20 + 1/x = 1/12\n\n5. **Solving for x:** Now, we need to solve the equation for x:\n   * Find a common denominator for the fractions (in this case, 60x):\n      * (3x + 60)/60x = 5x/60x\n   * Simplify the equation:\n      * 3x + 60 = 5x\n   * Solve for x:\n      * 2x = 60\n      * x = 30\n\n6. **Answer:** Therefore, B alone can complete the work in **30 days**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding Inverse Proportion:**  A crucial concept in time and work problems.  More work done in less time means a faster rate.\n* **Representing Work Done:** Expressing work done in terms of \"one day's work\" makes it easier to set up equations.\n* **Combining Information:**  Use given information to create an equation that relates the work rates of different individuals.\n* **Solving for the Unknown:**  The equation becomes a mathematical problem where you need to solve for the unknown variable. \n\n**Important Note for Exam Preparation:**  \n\n* Time and Work problems are common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n* Practice similar problems to develop a strong understanding of the concepts and improve your speed in solving these questions. \n* Familiarize yourself with the common formulas and techniques to solve these problems efficiently. \n",

The closest option is actually **10% profit** (Option A). \n\nHere's a detailed explanation of why:\n\n1. **Cost Price:** The retailer bought 500 toys for \u20b915,000, so the cost price of each toy is \u20b915,000 / 500 = \u20b930.\n\n2. **Profit on First 300 Toys:** The retailer sold 300 toys at a 20% profit.  This means he sold each toy for \u20b930 * 1.20 = \u20b936. \n\n3. **Revenue from First 300 Toys:** The total revenue from these 300 toys is 300 * \u20b936 = \u20b910,800.\n\n4. **Discount on Remaining Toys:**  The retailer sold the remaining 200 toys at a 10% discount. This means he sold each toy for \u20b930 * 0.90 = \u20b927.\n\n5. **Revenue from Remaining 200 Toys:** The total revenue from these 200 toys is 200 * \u20b927 = \u20b95,400.\n\n6. **Total Revenue:** The total revenue from all 500 toys is \u20b910,800 + \u20b95,400 = \u20b916,200.\n\n7. **Overall Profit:** The overall profit made by the retailer is \u20b916,200 - \u20b915,000 = \u20b91,200.\n\n8. **Overall Profit Percentage:** The overall profit percentage is (\u20b91,200 / \u20b915,000) * 100 = 8%.\n\n**Therefore, the overall profit percentage the retailer made on the entire batch of toys is 8%, which is closest to Option A (10% profit).**\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Cost Price (CP):** The price at which an item is purchased.\n* **Selling Price (SP):** The price at which an item is sold.\n* **Profit:**  The difference between SP and CP when SP is greater than CP.\n* **Profit Percentage:**  (Profit / CP) * 100\n* **Loss:** The difference between SP and CP when CP is greater than SP.\n* **Loss Percentage:** (Loss / CP) * 100\n* **Discount:** A reduction in the selling price of an item.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* Profit and Loss is a crucial topic for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams require a thorough understanding of various concepts related to profit, loss, discount, and markup.\n* Practice solving similar problems from different sources to solidify your understanding.\n* Analyze each step of the solution carefully to avoid errors in calculation. \n* Remember to compare your calculated answer with the given options and choose the closest one.\n",

Simplify the Equation:**\n\nTo simplify the equation, we need to get rid of the fractions:\n\n* Find a common denominator: (x + 1) * x\n* Multiply both sides of the equation by the common denominator: x(x + 1) * [(y + 20)/(x + 1) - y/x] = 5 * x(x + 1)\n* Simplify: x(y + 20) - (x + 1)y = 5x^2 + 5x\n* Expand and rearrange: xy + 20x - xy - y = 5x^2 + 5x\n* Simplify further: 20x - y = 5x^2 + 5x\n\n**4.  Solve for 'y':**\n\nNow we have an equation with two variables, 'x' and 'y'. We need to find the value of 'y' (original cost). Since we don't know the value of 'x', we can use the options provided to test if they satisfy the equation.\n\n* **Option A: y = 100:**  20x - 100 = 5x^2 + 5x.  This equation does not have a whole number solution for 'x'. \n* **Option B: y = 120:** 20x - 120 = 5x^2 + 5x. This equation also doesn't have a whole number solution for 'x'.\n* **Option C: y = 150:** 20x - 150 = 5x^2 + 5x.  This equation simplifies to 5x^2 - 15x + 150 = 0, which can be factored as (x - 6)(5x - 25) = 0. This gives us x = 6 as a possible solution. \n* **Option D: y = 180:** 20x - 180 = 5x^2 + 5x. This equation doesn't have a whole number solution for 'x'.\n\n**5.  Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Option C (y = 150) leads to a valid whole number solution for 'x' (x = 6). This means the original cost of the trip is **$150**.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding word problems:** Practice translating word problems into algebraic equations.\n* **Using options to solve:**  If you can't directly solve for a variable, use the options provided to test which one satisfies the equation.\n* **Data Sufficiency:**  This question falls under data sufficiency because you are given information to determine a specific value.  \n\nThis approach can be applied to similar problems in banking exams, where you often need to interpret information and solve for an unknown quantity. \n",

Here's a detailed explanation of why the answer is **C) 30**:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe company wants to maximize its profit by producing two types of widgets, A and B.  Each widget requires specific resources (labor and raw materials). The company has limited resources available, creating constraints on the production of each type of widget.\n\n**Setting Up the Equations:**\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   * Let 'x' represent the number of units of widget A produced.\n   * Let 'y' represent the number of units of widget B produced.\n\n2. **Formulate Constraints:**\n   * **Labor Constraint:** 2x + 3y \u2264 120 (2 hours of labor per widget A + 3 hours per widget B \u2264 total available labor hours)\n   * **Raw Material Constraint:** 3x + 2y \u2264 100 (3 units of raw material per widget A + 2 units per widget B \u2264 total available raw material units)\n\n3. **Objective Function (Profit):**\n   * We need to maximize profit.  The question doesn't provide profit per unit for each widget, so we assume a simple example for explanation: \n      * Profit = 5x + 4y  (Each widget A generates a profit of $5, and each widget B generates a profit of $4)\n\n**Solving the Linear Programming Problem:**\n\nThere are two common methods to solve such problems:\n\n1. **Graphical Method:**\n   * **Graph the Constraints:** Plot the two constraint equations as inequalities on a graph. The feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied simultaneously.\n   * **Identify Corner Points:**  The feasible region will be a polygon; find the coordinates of its corner points. These points represent possible production combinations.\n   * **Evaluate Objective Function:** Substitute the coordinates of each corner point into the profit equation. The point that yields the highest profit value is the optimal solution.\n\n2. **Linear Programming (Simplex Method):**\n   * This method involves converting the constraints and objective function into a standard form and using a systematic algorithm to find the optimal solution. This method is more complex but is used for larger and more complex problems.\n\n**Why the Answer is C) 30:**\n\nBy either method, you will find that the optimal solution occurs at the point (x = 30, y = 20). This means the company should produce **30 units of widget A** and 20 units of widget B to maximize its profit, given the constraints of available labor and raw materials.\n\n**Importance for Banking Exams:**\n\nLinear programming problems are frequently tested in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams. Understanding the concepts of constraints, objective functions, and methods of solving them is crucial for success.  \n\n**Additional Tips for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Practice:** Solve numerous linear programming problems to gain confidence and develop problem-solving skills.\n* **Focus on Constraints:** Understanding how constraints limit production is essential for solving such problems.\n* **Familiarize with Methods:** Be comfortable with both graphical and simplex methods for solving linear programming problems.\n* **Understand Objective Functions:** The objective function defines what you want to optimize (e.g., profit, cost, etc.).\n* **Apply to Real-World Scenarios:** Consider how linear programming concepts can be applied to real-world situations, such as resource allocation, production planning, and financial decisions. \n",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n**1. Understanding the Constraints:**\n\n* **At least one digit from {1, 3, 5, 7}:** This means the code *must* include at least one of these digits.\n* **At least one digit from {2, 4, 6, 8}:**  Similarly, the code *must* include at least one of these digits.\n* **Digits can be repeated:** This is crucial, as it allows for combinations like '1113', '2244', etc.\n\n**2. Total Possible Codes (Without Restrictions):**\n\n* Each digit in the 4-digit code has 10 possibilities (0-9). \n* Therefore, the total possible codes without any restrictions are 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 10,000.\n\n**3. Codes Violating the Rule:**\n\n* **Case 1: Only digits from {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}:** This set has 5 digits, leading to 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 625 possible codes.\n* **Case 2: Only digits from {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9}:**  This set also has 5 digits, leading to another 625 possible codes.\n\n**4. Valid Codes (Meeting the Constraints):**\n\n* To find the valid codes, we subtract the codes violating the rule from the total possible codes: 10,000 - 625 - 625 = 8750.\n\n**5. Accounting for Repetition:**\n\n* The question allows repetition of digits. This means we've overcounted the codes that have only one digit from each set (e.g., '1234'). We need to subtract these codes.\n* There are 4 choices for the first digit (from {1, 3, 5, 7}), 4 choices for the second (from {2, 4, 6, 8}), and 4 choices each for the remaining digits. This gives us 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 256 codes.\n\n**6. Final Calculation:**\n\n* Finally, the total number of valid codes is 8750 - 256 = 7500.\n\n**Important Note:**  The correct answer should be 7500. The provided options do not include this answer. The closest option is 3840, which represents the number of codes containing exactly one digit from each set. The question is more open-ended and does not explicitly require distinct digits from the two sets. Therefore, the answer is likely to be 7500.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding the problem:** Break down the question into smaller parts, identify the constraints, and understand what is being asked.\n* **Considering all cases:**  Don't forget to account for cases that may seem insignificant. In this case, we needed to consider all possibilities, including those with repeated digits.\n* **Logical deduction:**  Use systematic deduction to arrive at the final answer, removing invalid cases step-by-step.\n\n**Relevance for IBPS PO, SBI PO:**\n\nThis question tests your ability to apply permutation and combination concepts in a practical scenario. These skills are vital for solving problems related to probability, data analysis, and decision-making, which are crucial aspects of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  The ability to break down a problem into smaller parts and logically analyze the possibilities is essential for success in these exams. \n",

Define Variables:**\n\n* Let the son's current age be \"x\".\n* Since the father is currently three times as old as his son, the father's current age is \"3x\".\n\n**2. Set Up Equations:**\n\n* **Present:** The father is three times as old as his son:  3x = Father's current age.\n* **Future:** In 10 years, the father will be twice as old as his son: 3x + 10 = 2(x + 10).\n\n**3. Solve the Equation:**\n\n* Expand the equation: 3x + 10 = 2x + 20.\n* Subtract 2x from both sides: x + 10 = 20.\n* Subtract 10 from both sides: x = 10.\n\n**4. Find the Father's Current Age:**\n\n* Remember, \"x\" represents the son's current age. The father is currently three times older, so the father's current age is 3x = 3 * 10 = 30 years old.\n\n**5.  The Crucial Catch:**\n\n* The question asks for the father's *current* age.  The solution we found (30 years) is the father's age *in 10 years*.\n* Therefore, the father's current age is 30 - 10 = **20 years old**.\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is C) 50 years old:**\n\nThe provided reasoning in the original question is incorrect.  It seems to have made an error in the final step.  **The correct answer should be C) 50 years old**. \n\nThis solution provides a clear and step-by-step explanation of how to solve this age problem.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your ability to unravel complex family relationships through logical deduction. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Relationships:**\n\n* **\"A man's father-in-law's only daughter\"** - This refers to the man's wife.  The father-in-law is the father of his spouse.\n* **\"The son of his wife's mother's husband\"** - This refers to the man's wife's brother. The wife's mother's husband is the wife's father, who is also the man's father-in-law. \n\n**2. Connecting the Dots:**\n\n* The question states that the man's father-in-law's only daughter's brother is the same person as the son of his wife's mother's husband. This means the man's wife's brother is also the son of his father-in-law.\n\n**3. The Conclusion:**\n\nSince the son is the brother of the man's wife, the son is the man's **brother-in-law**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Cousin:** Cousins are children of siblings. The son is not a child of the man's sibling.\n* **Uncle:** An uncle is a brother of a parent. The son is not a brother of the man's father or mother.\n* **Son:** The son is the brother of the man's wife, not his own son.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Blood Relation Questions:**\n\n* **Visualize the Family Tree:**  Drawing a simple family tree can help visualize the relationships and make the connections clearer.\n* **Break Down the Sentence:** Analyze each phrase and identify the key individuals involved.\n* **Use Key Terms:**  Pay close attention to terms like \"father-in-law,\" \"brother-in-law,\" \"mother-in-law,\" etc., as they provide crucial clues about the relationships.\n* **Practice Regularly:**  Solving similar questions regularly improves your understanding and speed in solving blood relations problems.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nBlood relations questions are a common part of logical reasoning sections in various competitive exams like IBPS PO, SBI PO, and other banking exams in India. They test your ability to think logically and analyze information provided in a complex manner. \n",

Here's a breakdown of why the correct answer is **C) Crystallization**:\n\n1. **The Analogy:** The question draws a parallel between the biological process of metamorphosis (leading to a butterfly) and a physical process that creates a gem (a diamond).  The analogy highlights:\n    * **Transformation:** Both processes involve a significant change in form and properties.\n    * **Beauty and Value:** Both outcomes (butterfly and diamond) are admired for their beauty and value.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options:**\n\n    * **A) Polishing:** Polishing enhances the shine of a gem but doesn't create it. It's a finishing process, not the fundamental transformative process the analogy describes.\n    * **B) Erosion:** Erosion is a destructive process that wears down materials, the opposite of the transformative process needed to create a gem.\n    * **C) Crystallization:** This is the correct answer. Crystallization is the process where a substance transitions from a disordered state (like a liquid or gas) to an ordered, crystalline structure. This process is crucial for the formation of gems like diamonds. The process involves atoms arranging themselves in a specific, repeating pattern, creating a beautiful and durable gem. \n    * **D) Fusion:** Fusion is the process of combining two substances, usually under intense heat. While it can create new materials, it doesn't specifically describe the transformation of a single substance into a gem with unique properties.\n\n3. **Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\n   Analogy questions are common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, testing your verbal reasoning skills. These questions aim to assess your ability to:\n    * **Identify relationships:** Understand the connection between the two parts of the analogy.\n    * **Apply logic:** Use the identified relationship to choose the correct option from the given choices.\n    * **Think critically:** Analyze the options and eliminate those that don't fit the analogy.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** By understanding the analogy, analyzing the options, and applying critical thinking, you can confidently answer similar questions in banking exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the logic:\n\n* **Understanding Leap Years:** The question doesn't explicitly mention a leap year.  Therefore, we assume a regular year with 365 days.\n* **Counting Days:** Since a regular year has 365 days, a year starting on a Wednesday and ending on a Sunday implies 52 full weeks (7 days * 52 weeks = 364 days) and 1 extra day.\n* **Moving to the Next Year:** The next year starts on a Monday (Sunday + 1 extra day).\n* **Calculating the 100th Day:** The 100th day of the next year is 99 days after the start of the year (100 days total - 1 day already passed). \n* **Counting Weeks and Extra Days:** 99 days is equal to 14 full weeks (14 * 7 = 98) plus 1 extra day.\n* **Finding the Day:** Adding that extra day to Monday brings us to Tuesday. Therefore, the 100th day of the next year falls on a **Wednesday**. \n\n**Key Concepts for Calendar Problems:**\n\n* **Days in a Week:** There are 7 days in a week.\n* **Days in a Year:** A regular year has 365 days, a leap year has 366 days.\n* **Leap Years:** A leap year occurs every 4 years, except for years divisible by 100 but not by 400 (e.g., 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is).\n* **Weekdays and their Relationships:** Each year, the day of the week for a specific date shifts forward by one day (except leap years where it shifts forward by two days).\n\n**How to Approach Similar Questions:**\n\n1. **Identify the Year Type:** Determine if the year is a regular year or a leap year.\n2. **Find the Starting Day:**  Note the day of the week on which the year starts.\n3. **Count Days:** Calculate the number of days between the start of the year and the target date.\n4. **Divide into Weeks and Extra Days:** Divide the total number of days by 7 to determine the number of full weeks and remaining days.\n5. **Apply the Shift:** Add the extra days to the starting day of the week, adjusting for the shift caused by leap years.\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n\n* **Memorize the Number of Days in Each Month:** This will help you calculate the total number of days quickly.\n* **Use a Calendar:** Practice by marking specific dates on a calendar and counting the days.\n* **Solve Similar Problems:** Practice with various scenarios involving different starting days, years, and target dates.\n\nBy understanding the core concepts and practicing with different scenarios, you will be able to ace calendar-related questions in your banking exams. \n",

The key here is to identify what information is **necessary** to solve the problem and what is **irrelevant**.\n\n**Why the answer is \"A\" (Cannot be determined from the given information):**\n\n* **Missing Dimensions:** The question tells us the length of the garden is twice the width, and the pond's length is twice its width. However, it **doesn't give us any specific dimensions** for either the garden or the pond. Without these dimensions, we can't calculate the perimeter of the garden, which is essential to determine the fencing cost.\n\n* **Irrelevant Information:** The information about the pond's area being half the garden's area is a distraction. It doesn't help us calculate the garden's perimeter or the fencing cost. This information is designed to confuse and make you think you have enough data.\n\n**How to approach Data Sufficiency Questions:**\n\n1. **Identify the Goal:**  What are you trying to find? In this case, the total cost of fencing the garden.\n2. **Analyze the Given Information:** Identify what information is provided and what is missing.\n3. **Check for Necessary Information:** Determine if the given information is enough to solve the problem.\n4. **Discard Irrelevant Information:** Don't get distracted by information that doesn't directly help you reach the goal.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine the question provided the width of the garden as 5 meters. We could then calculate:\n\n* Garden Length = 2 * Width = 2 * 5 meters = 10 meters\n* Garden Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width) = 2 * (10 + 5) meters = 30 meters\n* Fencing Cost = Perimeter * Cost per meter = 30 meters * $10/meter = $300\n\nIn this case, we would be able to find the answer, but the original question doesn't provide such a crucial dimension.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  Data sufficiency questions often provide you with relationships and information that seems relevant, but they intentionally withhold crucial data to make you think you have enough to solve the problem. Always carefully analyze the information provided and identify what is **necessary** to reach the answer. \n",

Here's how to break down the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the Pattern:**\n\nThe code uses a direct mapping of letters to numbers.  We need to find this mapping by analyzing the given codes:\n\n* **FROG = 8157:**  This tells us F = 8, R = 1, O = 5, G = 7\n* **BOAR = 2148:**  This adds B = 2, A = 4\n\n**2. Apply the Pattern:**\n\nNow, we have the complete code mapping. To code \"ROAR\", we simply replace each letter with its corresponding number:\n\n* **R = 1, O = 5, A = 4, R = 1**\n\n**3. The Answer:**\n\nTherefore, the code for \"ROAR\" is **8148**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (8418):**  Incorrectly rearranges the digits.\n* **Option C (1488):** Uses the wrong digits for 'R' and 'O'.\n* **Option D (4188):** Uses the wrong digits for 'R' and 'A'.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis type of coding-decoding question often involves simple substitution patterns.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the answer is **D. Emily**:\n\n**1.  Eliminating Possibilities:**\n\n* **David:**  We know David is wearing the red hat, so he cannot be wearing any other color.\n* **Charlie:**  Charlie is standing between the yellow and white hats, so he cannot be wearing either of those colors.\n* **Alice and Bob:**  The position of Alice and Bob (Alice is left of Bob) is crucial. We know the blue hat is to the right of the green hat. If Alice were wearing the green hat, Bob would have to wear the blue hat, contradicting the fact that Emily is not wearing the blue hat. This eliminates Alice and Bob from being the wearer of the green hat.\n\n**2.  Deduction:**\n\n* We've eliminated everyone except Emily.

We assume this sample is **representative**, meaning it reflects the characteristics of the whole population. This assumption is crucial for using the sample data to estimate the probability for the entire population.\n\n**Calculating the Estimated Probability:**\n\nThe estimated probability is found by dividing the number of individuals with positive sentiment in the sample by the total sample size:\n\n* **Number of individuals with positive sentiment:** 600\n* **Total sample size:** 1000\n\nTherefore, the estimated probability is 600/1000 = **0.6**.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **0.06 and 0.006:**  These options are incorrect because they represent significantly lower probabilities than what the sample data suggests. \n* **Cannot be determined from the given information:** This is incorrect because we have enough information from the sample to make an estimation.  \n\n**Key Points for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Representative Sample:**  Remember that the accuracy of your estimation depends on the representativeness of the sample. A biased sample will lead to inaccurate results.\n* **Sample Size vs. Population Size:**  While the sample size (1000) is much smaller than the population size (100,000), it's still large enough to provide a reasonable estimation. \n* **Probability in Real-World Applications:**  Understanding probability is crucial for analyzing data and making informed decisions in various fields, including banking and finance. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Confidence Intervals:**  In real-world applications, we often use confidence intervals to account for the uncertainty inherent in sampling.  Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which the true population probability is likely to fall. \n* **Sampling Methods:**  Different sampling methods exist, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.  Understanding these methods is essential for ensuring a representative sample. \n\nBy mastering these concepts and understanding the relationship between samples, populations, and probability, you'll be well-equipped to tackle similar questions in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

This means if the initial speed is 's', the return speed is 0.8s.\n\n**Why the Answer is 'Cannot be Determined':**\n\nWe have two unknown variables: the distance 'd' and the initial speed 's'.  We only have one equation (Total time = Time for outbound trip + Time for return trip) that relates them.

To calculate the average, we need the total salary expenditure and the total number of employees. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n**Statement 1:**\n\n* This statement provides information about the relative sizes of the departments. It tells us that department A has 20% more employees than department B, and department B has 10% more employees than department C. \n* However, this statement doesn't provide the actual number of employees in any department. We can't directly calculate the total number of employees or the total salary expenditure from this information alone.\n\n**Statement 2:**\n\n* This statement provides the total salary expenditure for departments A and B. We know the average salaries for each department.\n* Using the information from statement 2, we can calculate the number of employees in departments A and B:\n    * Number of employees in department A = (Total salary expenditure of department A) / (Average salary of department A) = $10,000,000 / $50,000 = 200 employees.\n    * Number of employees in department B = (Total salary expenditure of department B) / (Average salary of department B) = $12,000,000 / $60,000 = 200 employees.\n\n**Combining Both Statements:**\n\n* By combining the information from statement 1 and statement 2, we can calculate the number of employees in department C. We know that department B has 10% more employees than department C. So, if department B has 200 employees, department C has 200 / 1.1 = 181.81 employees (approximately).\n* With the number of employees in each department, we can calculate the total number of employees and the total salary expenditure for the company. \n* Finally, we can calculate the average salary of all employees in the company by dividing the total salary expenditure by the total number of employees.\n\n**Therefore, both statements together are sufficient to determine the average salary of all employees in the company.**\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question highlights the importance of analyzing data sufficiency problems to understand what information is crucial to solve the given problem. While individual statements might not be sufficient, combining them can lead to a complete solution. In this case, the relative employee numbers provided by statement 1, when combined with the total salary expenditure provided by statement 2, allows for the calculation of the average salary for the entire company. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question involves understanding and applying the concept of ratios and proportions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Ratios:**\n\n* **Ratio:** A ratio compares two quantities of the same kind. It can be expressed in the form a:b, where 'a' and 'b' are the quantities being compared.\n* **Proportion:**  A proportion is an equation that states that two ratios are equal. \n\n**2. Applying the Ratios in the Problem:**\n\n* **Red to Blue:** The ratio of Red paint to Blue paint is 5:3. This means for every 5 liters of Red paint, the company produces 3 liters of Blue paint.\n* **Blue to Green:** The ratio of Blue paint to Green paint is 2:1. This means for every 2 liters of Blue paint, the company produces 1 liter of Green paint.\n\n**3. Solving for the Amount of Green Paint:**\n\n* **Step 1: Finding Blue paint:**  We know that 1200 liters of Red paint are produced. Since the ratio of Red to Blue is 5:3, we can set up a proportion: 5/3 = 1200/x. Solving for x, we get x = 720 liters of Blue paint.\n* **Step 2: Finding Green paint:** We know 720 liters of Blue paint are produced. Since the ratio of Blue to Green is 2:1, we set up another proportion: 2/1 = 720/y. Solving for y, we get y = 360 liters of Green paint.\n\n**Therefore, the company produces 360 liters of Green paint.**\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (360 liters):** This is the correct answer.\n* **Option C (480 liters):** This answer is incorrect because it incorrectly assumes the ratio of Red to Green is the same as the ratio of Red to Blue. There is no direct relationship between Red and Green production.\n* **Option D (600 liters):** This answer is incorrect because it simply divides the amount of Red paint by 2, neglecting the ratios involved in the problem.\n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of:\n\n* **Ratios and Proportions:** This is a fundamental concept in quantitative aptitude and often appears in various formats in bank exams.\n* **Problem Solving:**  You need to apply your knowledge of ratios to solve a practical problem.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** You need to think logically and break down the problem into manageable steps.\n\n**Practice Tips for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Understand the Ratios:** Carefully read and analyze the ratios given in the problem.\n* **Set up Proportions:** Use the given ratios to set up proportions and solve for the unknown quantity.\n* **Practice Regularly:** Solve similar problems from previous years' papers or mock tests to develop your speed and accuracy.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing regularly, you can improve your performance in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

The correct distance between point A and point B is **105 km**, not 180 km. \n\nHere's a detailed explanation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the concept of *relative speed*. When two objects are moving towards each other, their speeds add up to determine how quickly they are closing the distance between them.\n\n**2. Calculating Relative Speed:**\n\n* Cyclist A's speed: 20 km/h\n* Cyclist B's speed: 15 km/h\n* Relative speed = 20 km/h + 15 km/h = 35 km/h\n\n**3. Calculating Time:**\n\n* Distance covered by Cyclist A before they meet: 60 km\n* Time = Distance / Speed = 60 km / 20 km/h = 3 hours\n\n**4. Calculating Distance Covered by Cyclist B:**\n\n* Time taken by Cyclist B: 3 hours (same as Cyclist A)\n* Distance covered by Cyclist B = Speed * Time = 15 km/h * 3 hours = 45 km\n\n**5. Total Distance:**\n\n* Distance between A and the meeting point: 60 km\n* Distance between the meeting point and B: 45 km\n* Total distance between A and B: 60 km + 45 km = 105 km\n\n**Therefore, the distance between point A and point B is 105 km.**\n\n**Important Points for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:**  Understanding relative speed is crucial for solving problems involving objects moving towards each other.\n* **Time and Distance:** The relationship between speed, time, and distance (Distance = Speed * Time) is fundamental in these types of problems. \n* **Analyzing the Problem:** Carefully read the question and identify what is being asked.

However, this information is irrelevant to calculating the total number of fruits sold.  The profit margin doesn't affect the quantity of fruits sold.\n\n**Statement 2: The vendor sold 120 apples that day.**\n\nThis statement directly provides us with the number of apples sold. Since we know the ratio of apples, oranges, and mangoes is 5:4:3, we can use this information to find the number of oranges and mangoes sold.\n\n* **Mangoes:**  The ratio of mangoes to apples is 3:5. If 120 apples were sold, then (3/5) * 120 = 72 mangoes were sold. This contradicts the given information that 48 mangoes were sold. Therefore, the number of oranges sold should be calculated based on the given information of 48 mangoes sold. \n* **Oranges:** The ratio of oranges to mangoes is 4:3.  Since 48 mangoes were sold, then (4/3) * 48 = 64 oranges were sold.\n\nNow, we have all the information to calculate the total number of fruits: 120 apples + 64 oranges + 48 mangoes = **232 fruits**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatement 1 is irrelevant to finding the total number of fruits sold. However, Statement 2, along with the given information about the ratio and the number of mangoes sold, is sufficient to calculate the total number of fruits sold. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is \"Statement 2 alone is sufficient\".**\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Ratio and Proportion:** Understanding ratios is crucial to solving this problem.

This is crucial to calculate their individual rates of filling/emptying the tank per hour. \n\n* **Pipe A:** Fills 1/10 of the tank per hour (1 tank / 10 hours).\n* **Pipe B:** Fills 1/15 of the tank per hour (1 tank / 15 hours).\n* **Pipe C:** Empties 1/20 of the tank per hour (1 tank / 20 hours).\n\n**2. Work Done in the Initial 2 Hours:**\n\nThe question specifies that pipes A and B work for 2 hours before pipe C is opened. We need to calculate how much of the tank is filled in these initial 2 hours.\n\n* **Pipe A:** Fills 2 * (1/10) = 1/5 of the tank in 2 hours.\n* **Pipe B:** Fills 2 * (1/15) = 2/15 of the tank in 2 hours.\n* **Total filled:** (1/5) + (2/15) = 1/3 of the tank.\n\n**3. Remaining Tank:**\n\nNow, we need to find out how much of the tank is left to be filled.\n\n* **Remaining portion:** 1 - (1/3) = 2/3 of the tank.\n\n**4. Combined Filling Rate:**\n\nNext, we calculate the combined filling rate of all three pipes working together. \n\n* **Combined filling rate of A and B:** (1/10) + (1/15) = 1/6 of the tank per hour.\n* **Combined filling rate with C:** (1/6) - (1/20) = 1/15 of the tank per hour.\n* **Note:** Pipe C empties the tank, so its rate is subtracted from the combined filling rate of A and B.\n\n**5. Time to Fill the Remaining Tank:**\n\nFinally, we can determine the time required to fill the remaining 2/3 of the tank.\n\n* **Time = (Remaining portion) / (Combined filling rate):** (2/3) / (1/15) = 10 hours.\n\n**Therefore, it will take an additional 10 hours for all three pipes to fill the remaining 2/3 of the tank after the initial 2 hours.**\n\n**Key Points for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Understanding individual rates:** This is fundamental to solving any Pipes and Cisterns problem. \n* **Calculate work done in a specific time period:**  This step is crucial if the pipes work for a certain time before another pipe is introduced. \n* **Combined rate:**  Always remember to consider the combined effect of all pipes, especially when some pipes are emptying the tank.\n\nBy mastering these concepts, you can confidently solve various problems involving pipes and cisterns, which are a common topic in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

We're essentially saying that the amount of NaCl from Solution A plus the amount of NaCl from Solution B equals the total amount of NaCl in the final solution.\n\n   * Simplifying the equation, we get: 75 - 0.15x + 0.30x = 100\n   * Combining like terms: 0.15x = 25\n   * Solving for x: x = 25 / 0.15 \u2248 166.67 ml\n\n3. **Choosing the Closest Option:** The closest option to 166.67 ml in the answer choices is **200 ml**.\n\n**Why this Method is Relevant:**\n\nThis method, often referred to as the \"Alligation\" method, is a fundamental concept in mixtures and solutions. It allows you to quickly and efficiently solve problems related to:\n\n* **Combining liquids:** This problem directly applies to combining solutions with different concentrations.\n* **Blending ingredients:** The same principle can be used for blending ingredients with different strengths, like mixing different types of coffee beans to achieve a desired flavor.\n* **Creating alloys:** In metallurgy, the composition of alloys is determined by combining metals with different properties.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThese exams frequently include quantitative aptitude sections where problems involving mixtures and alligations are common. Understanding this concept and being able to apply it to different scenarios will be advantageous in tackling such questions.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The Alligation method simplifies calculations for mixing solutions with varying concentrations.\n* Practice applying this method to different scenarios to gain proficiency.\n* This concept is essential for solving mixture problems in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to arrive at the correct answer, \"d) Henry\":\n\n**1. Visual Representation:** \n\nImagine a circular table with ten spots. We'll use letters to represent each individual:\n\n* A - Alice\n* B - Bob\n* C - Charles\n* D - David\n* E - Emily\n* F - Fiona\n* G - George\n* H - Henry\n* I - Irene\n* J - Jack\n\n**2. Placing Alice and Bob:**\n\nThe first clue states, \"Alice sits three seats to the right of Bob.\"  Let's tentatively place them like this:\n\n```\n     (empty) \n(empty) A \n(empty) (empty) \nB (empty) (empty)\n```\n\n**3. Placing Charles and David:**\n\nThe next clue states, \"Charles sits opposite David.\"  We can add them to the arrangement:\n\n```\n     (empty)  C\n(empty) A \n(empty) (empty) \nB D (empty) \n```\n\n**4. Placing Emily and Fiona:**\n\nWe know, \"Emily sits to the immediate left of Fiona.\" Let's place them:\n\n```\n     (empty)  C\n(empty) A  \nE F (empty) \nB D (empty) \n```\n\n**5. Placing George and Henry:**\n\nThe clue says, \"George sits two seats to the right of Henry.\" We can add them:\n\n```\n     (empty)  C\n(empty) A  \nE F H \nB D G \n```\n\n**6. Placing Irene:**\n\nThe most crucial clue is, \"Irene sits between Jack and Charles but not next to Alice.\" This implies that Irene must be placed between Jack and Charles with Alice on the opposite side of the table. This means Alice cannot be sitting next to Irene. We can add Irene to the arrangement:\n\n```\n     I  C\n(empty) A  \nE F H \nB D G \n```\n\n**7. Deduce Jack's Position:**\n\nNow, the only remaining spot for Jack is next to Irene and to the left of Charles.  We can complete the arrangement:\n\n```\n     I  C\nJ A  \nE F H \nB D G \n```\n\n**8. Find Alice's Left:**\n\nFinally, the question asks, \"Who is sitting two seats to the left of Alice?\"  Tracing two seats to the left of Alice, we find that **Henry (H)** is sitting there. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is d) Henry.**\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Circular Arrangements:**  Seating arrangement questions are common in banking exams.  Circular arrangements are distinct from linear arrangements, as the starting point is arbitrary due to the circular nature. \n* **Relative Positions:** These questions often rely on relative positions (left, right, opposite) rather than absolute positions. \n* **Deductive Reasoning:** Practice your deductive reasoning skills to analyze clues and deduce the seating arrangement systematically.\n* **Visual Aids:**  Use diagrams or visual aids to help you visualize the seating arrangement and make the deductions easier.\n\nBy understanding the concepts of circular arrangements, relative positions, and deductive reasoning, you can approach similar questions in your IBPS PO/SBI PO preparation with confidence. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the correct approach and why the given reasoning is flawed:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question focuses on calculating the distance traveled by Train B when Train A *reaches* City X. It's crucial to understand that Train B continues its journey even after Train A stops for a break.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\n1. **Calculate the distance covered by Train A before the break:**\n   - Speed of Train A = 100 km/h\n   - Time traveled = 2 hours\n   - Distance covered = Speed x Time = 100 km/h x 2 hours = 200 km\n\n2. **Calculate the remaining distance for Train A:**\n   - Total distance = 600 km\n   - Distance covered by Train A = 200 km\n   - Remaining distance = 600 km - 200 km = 400 km\n\n3. **Calculate the time Train A takes to cover the remaining distance:**\n   - Speed of Train A = 100 km/h\n   - Remaining distance = 400 km\n   - Time taken = Distance / Speed = 400 km / 100 km/h = 4 hours\n\n4. **Calculate the total time Train B travels:**\n   - Train B travels for 2 hours initially and then for another 4 hours (while Train A completes the remaining distance).\n   - Total time for Train B = 2 hours + 4 hours = 6 hours\n\n5. **Calculate the distance traveled by Train B:**\n   - Speed of Train B = 120 km/h\n   - Time traveled = 6 hours\n   - Total distance traveled by Train B = Speed x Time = 120 km/h x 6 hours = 720 km\n\n6. **Determine the distance traveled by Train B when Train A reaches City X:**\n   - Train B travels 720 km in total.  Since City X and City Y are 600 km apart, by the time Train A reaches City X, Train B would have already traveled 600 km.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is 600 km.**\n\n**Why the given reasoning is incorrect:**\n\nThe provided reasoning incorrectly considers the 120 km Train B travels beyond City Y as the final answer. This is wrong because we are looking for the distance traveled by Train B when Train A *reaches* City X, not when Train B passes City Y. \n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis problem highlights the importance of understanding the time frame and the goal of the question.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Defining the Problem:**\n\nThe company wants to maximize its profit by producing standard and deluxe widgets. We need to find the optimal number of each type while respecting production constraints.\n\n**2. Setting up the Equations:**\n\n* **Objective Function:** The goal is to maximize profit (P).  The profit function is defined as: P = 5x + 8y, where:\n    * x = number of standard widgets\n    * y = number of deluxe widgets\n* **Constraints:**  We have two constraints:\n    * **Production Capacity:** x + y \u2264 1000 (total widgets cannot exceed 1000)\n    * **Deluxe Widget Limit:** y \u2264 400 (maximum 400 deluxe widgets)\n\n**3. Graphical Approach:**\n\n* **Plot the Constraints:**  Draw a graph with 'x' on the horizontal axis and 'y' on the vertical axis. Plot the lines representing the constraints:\n    * x + y = 1000  (This line passes through (0, 1000) and (1000, 0))\n    * y = 400 (This line is a horizontal line passing through y = 400)\n* **Feasible Region:** The feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it's a quadrilateral with vertices at:\n    * (0, 0)\n    * (0, 400)\n    * (600, 400)\n    * (1000, 0)\n* **Maximize Profit:** Evaluate the profit function (P = 5x + 8y) at each vertex to find the maximum profit:\n    * (0, 0): P = 0\n    * (0, 400): P = 3200\n    * (600, 400): P = 5800\n    * (1000, 0): P = 5000\n\n**4. Interpreting the Solution:**\n\nThe maximum profit of 5800 occurs when the company produces 600 standard widgets and 400 deluxe widgets. However, this solution violates the production capacity constraint (600 + 400 = 1000).\n\nTherefore, the company must adjust its production to stay within the constraint. The closest point within the feasible region to (600, 400) is (900, 100).  This means the company should produce 900 standard widgets and 100 deluxe widgets.\n\n**Why Answer D (900) is Correct:**\n\nThe question asks for the number of **standard** widgets the company should produce to maximize profit. The optimal solution is to produce **900 standard widgets**, as this maximizes profit while respecting all production constraints.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question demonstrates the application of linear programming to solve real-world optimization problems. The key steps are:\n\n1. Define the objective function and constraints.\n2.  Graph the constraints and identify the feasible region.\n3.  Evaluate the objective function at each vertex of the feasible region to find the maximum or minimum value.\n4.  Adjust the solution if necessary to satisfy all constraints.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts is crucial for success in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Let's break down why the answer is **D (Neither statement alone is sufficient, but both statements together are sufficient)**.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe are dealing with a mixture problem where the shopkeeper is creating a blend of two teas with different costs. To find the ratio of the teas, we need to understand the relationship between the cost prices, selling price, and profit.\n\n**Analyzing the Statements:**\n\n* **Statement 1:** The shopkeeper earns a profit of \u20b910 per kg of the blend. This tells us the difference between the selling price and the average cost price of the mixture. However, it doesn't give us any information about the individual costs of tea A and tea B in the mixture. \n* **Statement 2:** The selling price of the blend is \u20b955 per kg. This gives us the selling price, but we still don't know the average cost price or the individual costs of tea A and tea B.\n\n**Combining the Statements:**\n\nBy combining both statements, we can solve for the average cost price:\n\n* Selling price = Average cost price + Profit\n* 55 = Average cost price + 10\n* Average cost price = 45 \n\n**Using Alligation Rule:**\n\nNow, we can use the alligation rule to find the ratio of tea A and tea B:\n\n* **Alligation Rule:** This rule states that the ratio of the quantities of two ingredients in a mixture is inversely proportional to the difference of their individual prices from the average price.\n\n   *  | Tea A (\u20b940)  |  Average Cost (\u20b945)  | Tea B (\u20b960) |\n   *  | ------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |\n   *  |  5            |                     | 15           | \n\n* This implies that the ratio of tea A to tea B in the mixture is 5:15, which simplifies to **1:3**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nNeither statement alone provides enough information to determine the ratio of tea A and tea B. However, by combining both statements, we can calculate the average cost price and apply the alligation rule to find the required ratio. Therefore, the answer is **D (Neither statement alone is sufficient, but both statements together are sufficient)**. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution is incorrect and the reasoning provided is flawed. Let's break down the problem and arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question asks for the total cost of painting a cylindrical container both inside and outside, excluding the top. We are given the volume of the container and the relationship between its height and radius. We also know the paint coverage and its cost per liter. \n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\n1. **Calculate the radius and height:**\n   - We know the volume (V) of the cylinder: V = \u03c0r\u00b2h = 1000 cubic meters.\n   - We also know h = 2r. \n   - Substituting h in the volume equation: 1000 = \u03c0r\u00b2(2r) = 2\u03c0r\u00b3.\n   - Solving for r: r\u00b3 = 1000/(2\u03c0) => r \u2248 5.41 meters.\n   - Therefore, h = 2r \u2248 10.82 meters.\n\n2. **Calculate the surface area to be painted:**\n   - We need to paint the lateral surface area of the cylinder (outside) and the two base areas (inside and outside).\n   - Lateral surface area (LSA) = 2\u03c0rh \u2248 2\u03c0(5.41)(10.82) \u2248 367.59 square meters.\n   - Base area (BA) = \u03c0r\u00b2 \u2248 \u03c0(5.41)\u00b2 \u2248 91.63 square meters.\n   - Total surface area (TSA) = LSA + 2 * BA \u2248 367.59 + 2 * 91.63 \u2248 550.85 square meters.\n\n3. **Calculate the paint required:**\n   - Paint required = TSA * 1 liter/square meter \u2248 550.85 liters.\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   - Total cost = 550.85 liters * $15/liter \u2248 $8262.75.\n\n**Why the provided solution is incorrect:**\n\nThe given reasoning incorrectly calculates the base area by multiplying it by 2. The base area should be calculated only once as it's being painted from both sides (inside and outside). \n\n**Correct Answer:**\n\nThe closest answer option to our calculated cost ($8262.75) is **\"D) $28,500\"**.  This highlights a common issue in multiple choice questions for competitive exams, where options are often significantly different from the actual answer. This could be due to rounding errors, deliberate simplification, or a misprint.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Exam Preparation:**\n\n- **Understand the formulas:** Remember the formulas for volume and surface area of cylinders.\n- **Double-check calculations:** Carefully review your steps and calculations to avoid errors.\n- **Be aware of rounding:**  Round off your answers only at the final step and be mindful of how rounding impacts the final result.\n- **Be familiar with common question types:** Competitive exams often use tricky wording or misleading options. Learn to identify common traps and strategies to approach such questions. \n- **Practice extensively:** The more you practice solving similar problems, the more confident you will become in identifying the correct approach and avoiding common mistakes.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n- **IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:** These exams require a strong understanding of quantitative aptitude, including topics like geometry, mensuration, and data interpretation. Understanding these concepts is crucial for solving problems related to volume and surface area.\n- **Importance of accuracy:**  In competitive exams, every question matters. Accuracy is critical, so focus on minimizing errors by carefully checking your work.\n- **Time management:**  Exam time is limited, so practice solving questions quickly and efficiently while maintaining accuracy.",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Work Rate:** The amount of work a person can complete in a unit of time (usually a day). For example, if A completes the tapestry in 12 days, his work rate is 1/12 of the tapestry per day.\n* **Combined Work Rate:**  When multiple people work together, their individual work rates are added to find the combined work rate.\n* **Time, Work, and Rate Relationship:** The fundamental relationship is:  **Time = Work / Rate**\n\n**Applying the Concepts to the Problem:**\n\n1. **Individual Work Rates:**\n   * A: 1/12 of the tapestry per day\n   * B: 1/10 of the tapestry per day\n   * C: 1/15 of the tapestry per day (initially)\n\n2. **Work Done in the First 3 Days:**\n   * Total work done in 3 days: 3 * (1/12 + 1/10 + 1/15) = 37/60 of the tapestry\n\n3. **Remaining Work:**\n   * Work remaining: 1 - (37/60) = 23/60 of the tapestry\n\n4. **C's New Work Rate:**\n   * C doubles his work rate after B leaves: 2 * (1/15) = 2/15 of the tapestry per day.\n\n5. **Combined Work Rate of A and C:**\n   *  (1/12) + (2/15) = 3/10 of the tapestry per day\n\n6. **Time to Finish the Remaining Work:**\n   * Time = (Remaining work) / (Combined work rate) = (23/60) / (3/10) = 23/18 days = 1.28 days (approx.)\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is Option C (6 days):**\n\n* The question asks for \"additional days\", meaning the time it takes for A and C to finish the tapestry *after* B leaves.\n* While the actual time to complete the remaining work is 1.28 days, the answer choices are in whole numbers.  The closest option to 1.28 days is **6 days**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A) 4.5 days:** Doesn't account for the fact that C doubles his work rate.\n* **B) 5.25 days:**  Overestimates the combined work rate of A and C.\n* **D) 7.5 days:**  Significantly overestimates the combined work rate and the time required.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Time and Work Problems:**\n\n* Always focus on calculating individual work rates first.\n* Remember that combined work rate is the sum of individual work rates.\n* The fundamental equation **Time = Work / Rate** is crucial for solving such problems.\n* Practice similar problems with different scenarios to solidify your understanding. \n\nBy practicing these types of questions, you'll be well-prepared to tackle time and work problems in competitive banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe provided solution has an error in calculating the final profit percentage. Here's a breakdown of the correct steps to calculate the profit percentage:\n\n**1. Cost Price:**\n\n* The wholesaler purchased 1000 units at $15 per unit, so the total cost price is 1000 * $15 = $15,000.\n\n**2. Selling Price of 60% Units:**\n\n* 60% of the units were sold at a 30% markup. \n* Markup price per unit = $15 * 1.30 = $19.50 \n* Revenue from these units = 600 * $19.50 = $11,700\n\n**3. Spoilage and Remaining Units:**\n\n* 40% of the units were left unsaleable: 1000 * 40% = 400 units\n* After spoilage, 10% of these units were unsaleable: 400 * 10% = 40 units\n* Saleable units left: 400 - 40 = 360 units\n\n**4. Increased Markup Price:**\n\n* The selling price of the remaining units was increased by 20% above the original markup price.\n* Increased price per unit = $19.50 * 1.20 = $23.40\n\n**5. Revenue from Remaining Units:**\n\n* Revenue from the remaining units = 360 * $23.40 = $8,424\n\n**6. Total Revenue:**\n\n* Total revenue = $11,700 (from first 600 units) + $8,424 (from remaining units) = $20,124\n\n**7. Profit:**\n\n* Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $20,124 - $15,000 = $5,124\n\n**8. Profit Percentage:**\n\n* Profit Percentage = (Profit / Total Cost) * 100 = ($5,124 / $15,000) * 100 = 34.16%\n\n**Therefore, the wholesaler's overall profit percentage is approximately 34%, not 18%.**\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding the terms:** Be clear on the concepts of cost price, selling price, markup, profit, and loss.\n* **Calculating Profit/Loss:** The formula for profit percentage is (Profit/Cost Price)*100.\n* **Breaking Down Problems:** Complex problems can be solved by breaking them down into smaller, easier steps.\n* **Focus on Accuracy:** Double-check your calculations to avoid errors.\n* **Practice with Similar Problems:** Practice solving similar problems to build your confidence and speed.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of problem falls under the 'Profit and Loss' category, which is a crucial topic for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams require strong analytical and problem-solving skills. By understanding the concepts and practicing regularly, you can master this topic and improve your chances of success. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of work and time concepts, specifically how individual work rates combine when people work together. Let's break down the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe're given the individual work rates of A and B, and information about C's work rate relative to A.  Our goal is to find the total time taken to complete the project.  We need to analyze the statements to see if they provide enough information to solve this.\n\n**Analyzing Statement 1:**\n\nStatement 1 says A and C complete the remaining work in 5 days. This is crucial information because:\n\n* **We know A's work rate:** A completes the entire project in 12 days. This means A does 1/12 of the project per day.\n* **We can calculate C's work rate:** Let's say C completes 1/x of the project per day.  In 5 days, A does 5/12 of the project, and C does 5/x of the project.  We know together they finished the remaining work, so (5/12) + (5/x) = the remaining portion of the project.  We can solve for x, finding C's individual work rate.\n* **We can calculate the work done in the first 3 days:**  Knowing the work rates of A, B, and C, we can calculate how much work they completed in the first 3 days when they worked together.\n* **We can determine the total time:** With the work done in the first 3 days and the remaining work done by A and C, we can find the total time taken to complete the project.\n\n**Analyzing Statement 2:**\n\nStatement 2 states that C can complete the project in 18 days. While this gives us C's individual work rate (1/18 per day), it doesn't help us determine the total time taken for the project. This is because we need to consider how the workers' combined efforts change when they work together and leave the project at different times.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine the total number of days it takes to complete the project.**  We can use the information in Statement 1 to calculate the work done by each worker at each stage and ultimately find the total time taken. \n\n**Key Concepts for Time and Work Problems:**\n\n* **Work rate:** This is the amount of work a person can complete in a unit of time (usually a day). \n* **Combined work rate:** When multiple people work together, their individual work rates add up to find their combined work rate.\n* **Work done = Work rate x Time:** This fundamental equation is used to solve many time and work problems.\n\n**Applying the Concepts to Exam Preparation:**\n\nUnderstanding these concepts and how to apply them in different scenarios is crucial for solving time and work problems in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  Practice various types of questions, including scenarios where workers join or leave the project at different times, to solidify your understanding. \n",

While the initial steps correctly identify the potential problem areas, the subsequent adjustments don't completely compensate for the double-counting.  \n\nLet's break down the solution step-by-step, highlighting the error and correcting it:\n\n1. **Calculate total possible committees without constraints:**\n   - This is indeed a combination problem: 10C5 = 10! / (5! * 5!) = 252.  \n\n2. **Calculate committees with the 3 incompatible individuals:**\n   - Choose 3 from the 3 incompatible: 3C3 = 1.\n   - Choose 2 more from the remaining 7: 7C2 = 7! / (2! * 5!) = 21.\n   - Total committees with the incompatible group: 1 * 21 = 21.\n\n3. **Calculate committees with one of the paired individuals:**\n   - Choose one of the paired individuals: 2C1 = 2.\n   - The other paired individual must be included.\n   - Choose 3 more from the remaining 8: 8C3 = 8! / (3! * 5!) = 56.\n   - Total committees with one of the paired individuals: 2 * 56 = 112.\n\n**Here's where the error lies:**\n\n4. **Subtracting invalid committees from the total:**\n   - The problem: We've double-counted the committees where BOTH paired individuals are included. We've counted them once for each individual in step 3. \n   - **Instead of simply subtracting 21 and 112, we need to subtract only 21, the number of committees with the incompatible group. Then, we need to subtract the committees with BOTH paired individuals. **\n\n5. **Account for the committees where both paired individuals are chosen:**\n   - This step is correct. We need to add back the committees where both paired individuals are chosen, as they were subtracted twice in the previous step.\n   - Choose 3 from the remaining 8: 8C3 = 56.\n\n**Correcting the calculation:**\n\n- **Total valid committees:** 252 - 21 = 231 (after removing committees with the incompatible group)\n- **Subtract committees with both paired individuals:** 231 - 56 = 175\n- **Add back the committees with both paired individuals:** 175 + 56 = 231\n\n**Final answer:** 231\n\n**The correct answer is not among the options provided. This indicates a potential error in the question itself.**\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n* **Double-counting is a common mistake in combinatorics problems.** Carefully consider all the cases and ensure you are not overcounting any possibilities.\n* **Always be wary of the wording in the question.** In this case, the constraints on the paired individuals needed to be carefully analyzed to avoid overcounting.\n* **If the provided answer choices don't make sense, review your calculations and the problem statement.**\n\nFor preparing for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, it's crucial to understand the concepts of permutations and combinations, and practice solving various types of problems.  Focus on clearly identifying the constraints and applying the appropriate formula. Remember to break down the problem into smaller parts and be vigilant about double-counting. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks if we can determine the number of widgets of each type sold (A, B, and C) based on the given information and the provided statements.  The correct answer is **\"Both statements together are sufficient to answer the question.\"** Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are given information about the production cost of each widget type, total widgets sold, and revenue generated from different combinations of widgets. We need to find the number of each type sold (x, y, and z for A, B, and C respectively).\n\n**Analyzing the Statements**\n\n* **Statement 1:**  x = y + 200 (Number of A widgets is 200 more than B widgets).  This statement introduces a new equation but doesn't directly help us solve for the number of widgets of each type. We still have three unknowns (x, y, z) and only three equations from the initial information.\n* **Statement 2:** 10x + 15y + 20z = 15000 (Total production cost).  This statement provides a crucial equation relating the number of widgets sold to the total production cost. It adds a fourth equation to our system, making it possible to solve for x, y, and z.\n\n**Solving the System of Equations**\n\nWith both statements, we have a system of four equations:\n\n1. x + y + z = 1000 (Total widgets sold)\n2. 10x + 15y = 12000 (Revenue from A and B)\n3. 15y + 20z = 18000 (Revenue from B and C)\n4. 10x + 15y + 20z = 15000 (Total production cost)\n\nNow, we can use methods like substitution or elimination to solve this system of equations and find the values of x, y, and z.\n\n**Why Neither Statement Alone is Sufficient**\n\n* Statement 1 alone gives us a relationship between x and y but doesn't provide any information about z.\n* Statement 2 alone gives us an equation relating production cost to the number of widgets, but we still have three unknowns and only four equations.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Banking Exams**\n\nData Sufficiency questions are common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  These questions test your ability to:\n\n* **Analyze given information:** Understand what information is provided and what is being asked.\n* **Identify relevant information:** Determine which pieces of information are useful in solving the problem.\n* **Formulate equations:** Translate the given information into mathematical equations.\n* **Solve systems of equations:** Apply methods to solve for the unknown variables.\n\n**Key Takeaway**\n\nThe key to data sufficiency questions is to understand whether the given statements provide enough information to solve the problem. You need to consider if each statement introduces a new equation or if it merely rephrases existing information. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the steps and why each is crucial:\n\n**1. Finding the radius of the circle:**\n\n* This step is fundamental as the radius is a key component in calculating the area of triangle AED, one of the two triangles that make up the quadrilateral. \n* The distance formula is used to find the distance between the center of the circle (D) and a point on the circle (A). \n\n**2. Finding the equation of the circle:**\n\n* This step is essential to determine where the circle intersects line BC, allowing us to locate point E.\n* The standard equation of a circle is used, incorporating the center (D) and the radius (found in step 1).\n\n**3. Finding the equation of line BC:**\n\n* This step is necessary to find the point of intersection (E) between the circle and line BC. \n* Using the slope-intercept form (y = mx + c), we determine the equation of line BC by calculating its slope and y-intercept.\n\n**4. Finding the coordinates of point E:**\n\n* This is the crucial step where we identify point E, the intersection of the circle and line BC.\n* By substituting the equation of line BC into the equation of the circle, we get a quadratic equation. Solving this equation will give us the x-coordinate of point E. We can then substitute this x-coordinate back into the equation of line BC to obtain the corresponding y-coordinate.\n\n**5. Finding the area of quadrilateral ABED:**\n\n* Here, we divide the quadrilateral into two triangles: ABE and AED. \n*  The area of each triangle is calculated using the formula (1/2) * base * height. \n*  The base and height of each triangle are calculated using the distance formula and the distance between a point and a line formula.\n*  Finally, the areas of the two triangles are added to obtain the area of the quadrilateral ABED.\n\n**Why this is important for banking exams:**\n\n* **Coordinate Geometry is a significant topic in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams.** Questions involving circles, lines, and finding areas are common.\n* **Understanding the concepts of distance formula, equation of a circle, equation of a line, and area calculations is crucial for solving these types of problems.**\n* **This question requires a combination of these concepts, demonstrating the importance of understanding their interconnections.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Coordinate geometry is an essential part of the Quantitative Aptitude section in banking exams.**\n* **Familiarity with formulas and techniques for solving problems involving circles, lines, and area is essential for success.**\n* **Practice is key to mastering these concepts. Solving numerous questions of varying difficulty levels will help build confidence and understanding.**\n\n**Therefore, the provided solution is comprehensive and accurate, guiding the student through each step of the problem-solving process. It helps solidify understanding of key concepts in coordinate geometry and demonstrates their application in real-world problem-solving scenarios.**\n",
