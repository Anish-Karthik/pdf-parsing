            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **B. Variables can change their values during program execution, while constants remain fixed.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this is the core difference and why other options are incorrect:\n\n**Understanding Variables:**\n\n* Variables are like containers that hold data. This data can be anything \u2013 numbers, text, lists, etc.\n* The key feature of variables is their **mutability**. This means their values can be changed throughout the program's execution.\n* **Example:** Imagine a variable named `age` storing your current age. You can change the value of `age` as you get older.\n\n**Understanding Constants:**\n\n* Constants are also like containers that hold data, similar to variables.\n* However, unlike variables, constants are **immutable**. Once assigned a value, their value **cannot** be changed throughout the program's lifetime.\n* **Example:**  Imagine a constant named `PI` storing the mathematical constant 3.14159. This value will always remain the same throughout your program.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A. Variables can store data, while constants cannot.**  This is incorrect. Constants can store data, but their values cannot be changed once assigned.\n* **C. Variables are used for storing temporary values, while constants store permanent values.** This is partially correct but misleading. Constants are not necessarily permanent in a broader sense, but their values remain consistent within the program's execution.\n* **D. Variables are declared using the 'const' keyword, while constants are declared using 'var'.** This is incorrect. In many programming languages, the `const` keyword is used to declare constants, while `var` (or similar keywords) is used to declare variables.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile you might not directly code in your banking career, understanding the fundamental concepts of variables and constants is essential.  It helps you grasp how computers process and manage data, a crucial skill for any role involving technology.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThink of variables as flexible containers that can adapt to changing information. Constants, on the other hand, are like fixed values that remain unchanged throughout your program. This distinction is fundamental to understanding how programs work and manipulate data. \n",

Here's how we can do that:\n\n1. **Find the largest perfect square that divides 45:** The largest perfect square that divides 45 is 9 (since 9 x 5 = 45).\n\n2. **Rewrite the radical:** We can rewrite \u221a45 as \u221a(9 x 5).\n\n3. **Apply the product property of radicals:** The product property of radicals states that \u221a(a x b) = \u221aa x \u221ab.  Using this property, we can rewrite \u221a(9 x 5) as \u221a9 x \u221a5.\n\n4. **Simplify:**  \u221a9 = 3, so \u221a45 simplifies to 3\u221a5.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is A) 3\u221a5.**\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **B) 5\u221a3:** This incorrectly assumes that the square root of 45 is the product of the square roots of 5 and 3.\n* **C) 9\u221a5:** This incorrectly takes the square root of the entire number 45 and multiplies it by \u221a5.\n* **D) \u221a9 + \u221a5:** This does not simplify the expression, but simply rewrites it in a different form.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Perfect Square:** A perfect square is a number that can be obtained by squaring an integer (e.g., 9 is a perfect square because 3\u00b2 = 9).\n* **Product Property of Radicals:** \u221a(a x b) = \u221aa x \u221ab.\n\n**Applying the concept to similar questions:**\n\nTo simplify other radical expressions, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the largest perfect square that divides the number under the radical.**\n2. **Rewrite the radical using the product property.**\n3. **Simplify the perfect square radical.**\n\nFor example, to simplify \u221a72:\n\n1. The largest perfect square that divides 72 is 36 (since 36 x 2 = 72).\n2. \u221a72 = \u221a(36 x 2) = \u221a36 x \u221a2\n3. \u221a36 = 6, so \u221a72 simplifies to 6\u221a2.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Banking Exams:**\n\nSimplifying radical expressions is a fundamental skill in mathematics and is tested in various competitive exams like IBPS PO, SBI PO, and other banking exams.

Write this below the dividend and subtract it from the dividend.\n4. **Bring down the next term:** Bring down the next term of the dividend (12) to form a new polynomial (4x + 12).\n5. **Repeat steps 2-4:** Divide the leading term of the new polynomial (4x) by the leading term of the divisor (x) to get 4. Write this 4 in the quotient area next to the 'x'. \n6. **Continue until the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor:** Multiply 4 by (x + 3) to get (4x + 12) and subtract it from the current polynomial.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks us to solve the absolute value inequality: **|x - 3| < 2**. To understand this, let's break down the concept of absolute value and how it relates to inequalities.\n\n**Understanding Absolute Value**\n\nThe absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero on the number line. For example, |3| = 3 and |-3| = 3.  The absolute value is always a non-negative number.\n\n**Solving Absolute Value Inequalities**\n\nWhen solving absolute value inequalities, we need to consider two separate cases:\n\n**Case 1:  x - 3 \u2265 0**\n\n* In this case, the absolute value is simply the expression inside the bars:  |x - 3| = x - 3\n* Our inequality becomes: x - 3 < 2\n* Solving for x: x < 5\n\n**Case 2: x - 3 < 0**\n\n* In this case, the absolute value is the negative of the expression inside the bars: |x - 3| = -(x - 3)\n* Our inequality becomes: -(x - 3) < 2\n* Solving for x: x > 1\n\n**Combining the Solutions**\n\nOur solutions are: x < 5 (from Case 1) and x > 1 (from Case 2). To combine these, we need to find the values of x that satisfy both conditions. This gives us:\n\n**1 < x < 5**\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (x < 1 or x > 5):** This represents the solution to |x - 3| > 2, not |x - 3| < 2.\n* **Option C (x < 5):** This only considers Case 1 and doesn't account for the second case where x > 1.\n* **Option D (x > 1):** This only considers Case 2 and ignores Case 1.\n\n**Therefore, the correct solution to the inequality |x - 3| < 2 is 1 < x < 5, which is represented by option A.**\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding and solving absolute value inequalities is crucial for various sections of IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, including:\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** This topic often appears in questions involving numbers, equations, and inequalities.\n* **Reasoning Ability:** Absolute value concepts can be applied to logic-based problems and data interpretation.\n\nBy mastering this concept, you will be well-equipped to tackle a variety of questions in these exams, improving your overall score. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of inequalities and how they interact with basic arithmetic operations. Let's break down why option **b) x - y > 2** is always true.\n\n**Understanding the Given Information:**\n\n* **x > 7:** This means x is a number larger than 7.\n* **y < 5:** This means y is a number smaller than 5.\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n* **a) x + y > 12:** This statement is **not always true**.  If y is close to 5, the sum of x and y might be less than 12. For example, if x = 8 and y = 4, x + y = 12, not greater than 12.\n* **b) x - y > 2:** This statement is **always true**. Since x is always greater than 7 and y is always less than 5, the difference between them (x - y) will always be greater than 2.\n* **c) x * y > 35:** This statement is **not always true**. If y is close to 5, the product of x and y might be less than 35. For example, if x = 8 and y = 4, x * y = 32, not greater than 35.\n* **d) x / y < 1:** This statement is **not always true**. If x is close to 7, the quotient of x divided by y (x / y) might be greater than or equal to 1. For example, if x = 7 and y = 4, x / y = 1.75, not less than 1.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThe core reason option **b) x - y > 2** is always true is due to the fact that x is always larger than y. This means that subtracting y from x will always result in a value greater than 2.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. They assess your ability to:\n\n* **Interpret and analyze inequalities:** Understanding the relationship between variables based on inequalities is crucial for solving problems related to interest rates, profit/loss calculations, and other financial concepts.\n* **Apply basic arithmetic operations:** You need to be comfortable with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, especially within the context of inequalities.\n* **Logical reasoning:**  The ability to reason logically and eliminate incorrect options is essential for making sound financial decisions.\n\n**Practice Tip:**\n\nTo excel in these types of questions, practice solving similar problems with different inequalities and variations in arithmetic operations.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** The problem describes a scenario where John cuts a piece of rope from a longer rope. The length of the cut piece depends on the length of the remaining rope.\n\n2. **Setting up the Equation:** Let's represent the length of the cut piece as 'x'.  We know:\n    * The original rope is 12 meters long.\n    * The cut piece is 3 meters shorter than the remaining rope.\n    * The remaining rope is 12 meters - x (the length of the cut piece).\n\n    This can be expressed as the equation: x = (12 - x) - 3\n\n3. **Solving the Equation:**\n    * Simplify the equation: x = 9 - x\n    * Add x to both sides: 2x = 9\n    * Divide both sides by 2: x = 4.5\n\n4. **Incorrect Answer:** The provided answer is \"6 meters\". This is incorrect because it assumes the cut piece is 3 meters shorter than the *original* rope, not the *remaining* rope.\n\n5. **Correct Answer:** The correct answer is \"4.5 meters\". This is calculated by solving the equation we set up, which accurately represents the given information in the word problem.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Linear Equations:** These are equations that represent a straight line when graphed. In this case, we use a linear equation to represent the relationship between the length of the cut piece and the remaining rope.\n* **Word Problem Translation:** The ability to convert a word problem into a mathematical equation is crucial for solving many problems, including those involving linear equations.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThese types of word problems are commonly found in quantitative aptitude sections of competitive banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

The total number of apples (a) plus the number of oranges (o) must be greater than or equal to 5.\n* **a + 0.5o \u2264 4**  This inequality represents Sarah's budget constraint. The cost of apples (a * $1) plus the cost of oranges (o * $0.50) should be less than or equal to $4.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B:**  a + o \u2264 5 and a + 0.5o \u2265 4. This option suggests Sarah wants to buy no more than 5 pieces of fruit (a + o \u2264 5) and spend at least $4 (a + 0.5o \u2265 4), contradicting the given information.\n* **Option C:** a + o \u2265 5 and a + 0.5o \u2265 4.

For example, |5| = 5 and |-5| = 5, because both 5 and -5 are 5 units away from zero.\n\n**Absolute Value Inequalities:**\n\nWhen dealing with inequalities involving absolute values, we need to consider both positive and negative cases:\n\n1. **Case 1: Positive Case**\n    * If  |x + 3| < 2, then (x + 3) is less than 2 units away from zero. This means: \n        * x + 3 < 2\n\n2. **Case 2: Negative Case**\n    * If |x + 3| < 2, then -(x + 3) is less than 2 units away from zero. This means:\n        * -(x + 3) < 2 \n        * x + 3 > -2 (Multiplying both sides by -1 flips the inequality sign)\n\n**Combining the Cases:**\n\nTo satisfy both cases, the solution to the inequality |x + 3| < 2  is the intersection of the solutions from both cases:\n\n* x + 3 < 2  **AND** x + 3 > -2\n\nThis can be written in a more compact form:\n\n* **-2 < x + 3 < 2**\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **B) -2 < x < 2:** This option doesn't consider the \"+3\" within the absolute value, making it incorrect.\n* **C) x + 3 < 2:** This option only considers the positive case, ignoring the negative case of the absolute value.\n* **D) x + 3 > 2:** This option only considers a part of the negative case and ignores the positive case completely.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct equivalent inequality to |x + 3| < 2 is **-2 < x + 3 < 2**. This is because it encompasses both the positive and negative cases of the absolute value, ensuring the solution captures all possible values of 'x' that satisfy the original inequality. \n",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Defining the Variables:**\n\n* **x:** Number of chocolate cakes\n* **y:** Number of vanilla cakes\n\n**2. Formulating the Constraints:**\n\n* **Baking Time Constraint:** Each chocolate cake takes 2 hours and each vanilla cake takes 1 hour. The bakery has 10 hours available. This translates to the inequality: **2x + y \u2264 10**\n* **Flour Constraint:** Each chocolate cake requires 1 pound of flour and each vanilla cake needs 2 pounds. The bakery has 8 pounds of flour. This leads to the inequality: **x + 2y \u2264 8**\n\n**3. Non-Negativity Constraints:**  \nSince we cannot produce a negative number of cakes, we have: \n* **x \u2265 0**\n* **y \u2265 0**\n\n**4. Graphical Representation:**\n\n* **Plot the Constraints:** Each constraint is a linear inequality. To graph them, treat them as equations.\n    * **2x + y = 10:**  To plot this line, find the x and y intercepts. When x = 0, y = 10. When y = 0, x = 5. Plot these points and draw the line connecting them.\n    * **x + 2y = 8:** Similarly, find the intercepts. When x = 0, y = 4. When y = 0, x = 8. Plot these points and draw the line.\n    * **x = 0 and y = 0:** These represent the y-axis and x-axis respectively.\n\n* **Shading the Feasible Region:** The feasible region is the area on the graph where all constraints are satisfied. This is the area where the shaded regions of all inequalities overlap.\n\n**5. Identifying the Optimal Point:**\n\n* **Objective Function:** The question asks for the maximum number of chocolate cakes (x). This is our objective function: **Maximize x**\n* **Corner Points:** The feasible region is a polygon. The maximum value of x will occur at one of the corner points of this polygon. \n* **Testing Corner Points:** Calculate the value of x at each corner point. The point with the highest value of x will give you the maximum number of chocolate cakes you can produce.\n\n**In this case, the corner point that maximizes x is (2, 3). This means you can produce a maximum of 2 chocolate cakes (x = 2) and 3 vanilla cakes (y = 3).**\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C) 2.**\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThe graphical method is a powerful tool for solving linear programming problems. By plotting the constraints and identifying the feasible region, you can find the optimal solution that maximizes or minimizes your objective function. This method is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and decision-making in various business scenarios. \n",

Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* Sarah buys a total of 10 fruits (apples and oranges).\n* Apples cost $1 each, and oranges cost $0.50 each.\n* Her total spending is $7.\n\n**Setting up the Equations:**\n\nLet:\n\n* **'a'** represent the number of apples.\n* **'o'** represent the number of oranges.\n\nWe can form two equations based on the given information:\n\n1. **Equation 1 (Total Fruits):** a + o = 10\n2. **Equation 2 (Total Cost):** 1a + 0.5o = 7\n\n**Applying the Elimination Method:**\n\nThe goal of the Elimination Method is to eliminate one variable (either 'a' or 'o') by manipulating the equations.  Here's how:\n\n1. **Multiply Equation 2 by -1:** This will change the sign of each term in the equation.\n   - (-1) * (1a + 0.5o = 7) \n   - -a - 0.5o = -7\n\n2. **Add the modified Equation 2 to Equation 1:** Notice that the 'a' terms now have opposite signs, allowing them to cancel out.\n   - a + o = 10\n   - -a - 0.5o = -7\n   - 0.5o = 3\n\n3. **Solve for 'o':**\n   - 0.5o = 3\n   - o = 3 / 0.5 \n   - o = 6\n\n**Why the Answer is Incorrect and the Correct Approach:**\n\nThe reasoning provided in the question initially states that Sarah bought 6 oranges. However, this is incorrect. Here's why:\n\n* The calculation finds the number of oranges IF Sarah had spent $7 **solely** on oranges. \n* We need to consider the cost of the apples.\n\n**The Correct Approach:**\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of 6 oranges:** 6 oranges * $0.50/orange = $3\n2. **Subtract the cost of oranges from the total cost:** $7 - $3 = $4\n3. **This remaining $4 represents the cost of the apples.**\n4. **Calculate the number of apples:** $4 / $1/apple = 4 apples\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is A) 4. Sarah bought 4 oranges.**\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Master the Elimination Method:**  This is a fundamental technique for solving systems of linear equations, frequently encountered in quantitative aptitude sections of these exams.\n* **Read Carefully and Analyze:** Understand the problem thoroughly before jumping into calculations.  The question might be designed to mislead, like in this case.\n* **Double-Check your Logic:**  Always verify your answers and ensure they make logical sense within the context of the problem.\n\nBy understanding the Elimination Method and practicing such problem-solving techniques, you'll be well-equipped to tackle quantitative aptitude questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Simplified Expression:**\n\nThe simplified expression is **6x\u00b3 - 11x\u00b2 - 12x + 5**\n\n**Therefore, option A is the correct answer.**\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThe distributive property is crucial for multiplying polynomials. By consistently applying it, you can expand the product of two polynomials and then simplify the resulting expression by combining like terms. This process is essential for various algebraic manipulations and problem-solving in mathematics. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nMultiplying polynomials is a fundamental concept in algebra and is often used in higher-level mathematics, including calculus.

The parabola opens downwards, and its vertex is at (0, 2).**\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Identifying the Parabola's Orientation:**\n\n   * The function f(x) = -3x\u00b2 + 2 is a quadratic function in the standard form f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c.\n   * The coefficient of the x\u00b2 term (a) determines the orientation of the parabola.\n   * If 'a' is positive, the parabola opens upwards. If 'a' is negative, the parabola opens downwards.\n   * In this case, a = -3, which is negative. Therefore, the parabola opens downwards.\n\n2. **Determining the Vertex:**\n\n   * The vertex of the parabola is the point where the parabola reaches its maximum or minimum value. \n   * For a quadratic function in standard form, the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by -b/2a.\n   * In this case, b = 0 (since there's no x term) and a = -3. So, -b/2a = 0 / (2 * -3) = 0.\n   * The y-coordinate of the vertex is simply the value of the function at the x-coordinate of the vertex. Therefore, f(0) = -3(0)\u00b2 + 2 = 2.\n   * Hence, the vertex of the parabola is (0, 2).\n\n**In summary:**\n\n* The negative coefficient of the x\u00b2 term (-3) indicates the parabola opens downwards.\n* The vertex of the parabola is calculated to be (0, 2).\n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* Understand the relationship between the coefficient of the x\u00b2 term and the orientation of the parabola.\n* Know how to calculate the vertex of a parabola in standard form.\n* Practice recognizing and analyzing quadratic functions in different forms.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Parabolas** are commonly encountered in various mathematical and real-world applications.\n* **Quadratic equations** are used to model many real-world phenomena, like projectile motion, the path of a thrown ball, or the shape of a suspension bridge.\n* **Graphing functions** is an essential skill for understanding and analyzing mathematical relationships and their applications.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing with various problems, you can improve your performance on IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, which often feature questions related to graphing functions and quadratic equations. \n",

For example, |3| = 3 and |-3| = 3.\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\n* Let 'x' be the actual length of the table top.\n* The desired length is 6 feet.\n* The difference between the actual length and desired length is 0.5 feet.\n\nWe can express this as an absolute value equation: **|x - 6| = 0.5**\n\nThis equation states that the absolute value of the difference between the actual length (x) and the desired length (6) is 0.5 feet.\n\n**Solving the Equation:**\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to consider both positive and negative possibilities:\n\n* **Case 1:**  x - 6 = 0.5  \n   Solving for x, we get x = 6.5 feet.\n* **Case 2:** x - 6 = -0.5\n   Solving for x, we get x = 5.5 feet.\n\n**The Range of Lengths:**\n\nTherefore, the possible lengths of the table top range from **5.5 feet to 6.5 feet.**\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **B) 5 feet to 7 feet:** This range is too wide. The maximum variation from the desired length is 0.5 feet.\n* **C) 5.5 feet to 7 feet:** This range includes a value (7 feet) that exceeds the maximum allowable variation.\n* **D) 6 feet to 6.5 feet:** This range only considers the possibility of a longer table top, ignoring the possibility of a shorter table top.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question is a good example of how the concept of absolute value is used in practical scenarios. Banking exams often test candidates' analytical and problem-solving skills, and understanding how to translate real-world situations into mathematical equations is crucial. \n",

Rs. 11,576.25\":**\n\n1. **Understanding Compound Interest:** Compound interest means that the interest earned in each period is added to the principal, and the interest for the next period is calculated on the new principal. This leads to exponential growth.\n\n2. **Formula for Compound Interest:** \n   *  **A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)**\n    *  **A** =  Final Amount \n    *  **P** = Principal Amount (initial loan amount)\n    *  **r** = Annual interest rate (as a decimal)\n    *  **n** = Number of times interest is compounded per year \n    *  **t** = Time in years\n\n3. **Applying the Formula:**\n    *  In this case, P = 10,000 (loan amount), r = 0.05 (5% annual interest), n = 1 (compounded annually), and t = 3 (loan duration).\n    *  Substituting these values in the formula, we get:\n      *  A = 10,000 (1 + 0.05/1)^(1 * 3)\n      *  A = 10,000 (1.05)^3\n      *  A = 10,000 * 1.157625\n      *  A = 11,576.25\n\n**Therefore, the total amount the customer will have to repay at the end of 3 years is Rs. 11,576.25.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Simple Interest vs. Compound Interest:** Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on both the principal and accumulated interest. This makes compound interest a more powerful tool for growth over time.\n* **Importance for Banking Exams:** Understanding compound interest is crucial for aspiring banking professionals. It's used in various financial products like loans, deposits, and investments.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** \nFor solving compound interest problems, remember the formula and practice applying it with different scenarios. Understanding the core concept will help you analyze various financial products effectively. \n",

Instead, it's a problem involving **simple interest calculation and basic algebra**. Here's a breakdown of how to solve it:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* The bank charges a standard 5% interest per annum.\n* A penalty of \u20b9500 is added if the loan amount exceeds \u20b910 lakh.\n* The borrower pays a total of \u20b910,000 in interest and penalty. \n* We need to find the total loan amount.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the interest paid:** The total amount paid is \u20b910,000, and the penalty is \u20b9500. Therefore, the interest paid is \u20b910,000 - \u20b9500 = \u20b99,500.\n\n2. **Find the loan amount exceeding \u20b910 lakh:** Let 'x' be the loan amount exceeding \u20b910 lakh. The interest on this amount is calculated as 5% of 'x', which is 0.05x.\n\n3. **Set up an equation:** We know the interest is \u20b99,500.  So, we can write the equation: 0.05x = \u20b99,500\n\n4. **Solve for x:** Divide both sides of the equation by 0.05: x = \u20b99,500 / 0.05 = \u20b9190,000\n\n5. **Calculate the total loan amount:**  The total loan amount is the amount exceeding \u20b910 lakh plus the initial \u20b910 lakh. Therefore, the total loan amount is \u20b9190,000 + \u20b910,00,000 = \u20b922,00,000 or \u20b922 lakh.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option D: \u20b922 lakh.**\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Simple Interest:**  Interest calculated only on the principal amount.\n* **Algebraic Equations:**  Using variables and equations to represent unknown quantities and solve problems.\n\n**Why this is relevant for IBPS PO, SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** This problem tests your ability to apply basic mathematical concepts and solve real-world problems.\n* **Logical Reasoning:**  Understanding the problem, breaking it down into smaller parts, and solving it step-by-step is crucial for success in these exams.\n\n**Tips for similar questions:**\n\n* **Read carefully:** Understand the conditions and terms mentioned in the problem.\n* **Identify the key information:**  Highlight the important numbers and relationships.\n* **Use variables:** Represent unknown quantities with variables to set up equations.\n* **Solve the equations:**  Apply algebraic techniques to find the solutions.\n\nBy understanding the concepts and applying these strategies, you can tackle similar questions in IBPS PO, SBI PO, and other banking exams effectively. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Restrictions:**\n\n* **Square Root:** The square root of a negative number is not a real number. Therefore, the expression inside the square root, (x^2 - 9), must be greater than or equal to zero. This leads to the inequality: \n   * x^2 - 9 \u2265 0\n   * (x - 3)(x + 3) \u2265 0 \n   * This inequality is satisfied when x \u2264 -3 or x \u2265 3. \n* **Denominator:** The denominator, (x - 3), cannot be zero. Therefore, x cannot be equal to 3.\n\n**Finding the Range:**\n\n1. **Non-negative Numerator:** The numerator, \u221a(x^2 - 9), is always non-negative due to the square root. \n2. **Non-zero Denominator:** The denominator, (x - 3), is always non-zero because we've excluded x = 3.\n3. **Possible Values:** Since the numerator is always non-negative and the denominator is always non-zero, the function can take on both positive and negative values. \n4. **Zero is not achievable:** However, the function can never be equal to zero. To make the function equal to zero, the numerator needs to be zero. But, the numerator is only zero when x = 3, which is excluded from the domain.\n\n**Therefore, the range of the function f(x) = \u221a(x^2 - 9) / (x - 3) is all real numbers greater than zero (Option D).**\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\nUnderstanding domain and range of functions is crucial for several topics covered in banking exams, including:\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:**  Solving problems involving inequalities, functions, and graphs requires understanding domain and range.\n* **Data Interpretation:**  Analyzing graphs and charts involves understanding how data is represented and the limitations of the underlying functions.\n* **Reasoning Ability:**  Problems involving logical reasoning often involve analyzing relationships and patterns, which can be facilitated by understanding function behavior.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Always consider the restrictions imposed by square roots and denominators when determining the domain and range of a function.\n* Understanding the behavior of functions (like whether they can be zero, positive, or negative) is essential for determining the range.\n\nBy practicing with questions like this and understanding the underlying concepts, you will be well-prepared to tackle similar problems in the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

This problem involves understanding basic concepts of speed, distance, and time, and applying them to solve a linear equation. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:** The key is to focus on the **relative speed** between the two trains. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we subtract the speed of the slower train from the speed of the faster train (80 km/h - 60 km/h = 20 km/h). This tells us that the second train is effectively closing the distance at 20 km/h.\n\n* **Initial Gap:** The first train has a 1-hour head start. In that hour, it travels 60 km (60 km/h * 1 h), creating an initial gap of 40 km (100 km - 60 km) between the two trains.\n\n**2. Setting Up the Equation:**\n\nLet:\n\n* 't' be the time (in hours) it takes for the second train to overtake the first train.\n\nWe can use the formula: **Distance = Speed x Time**\n\n* **Distance:**  The second train needs to cover the 40 km gap.\n* **Speed:** The relative speed of the second train is 20 km/h.\n* **Time:**  We need to find 't'.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes: 40 km = 20 km/h * t\n\n**3. Solving the Equation:**\n\nTo solve for 't', we divide both sides of the equation by 20 km/h:\n\n* t = 40 km / 20 km/h = 2 hours\n\nThis means it takes 2 hours for the second train to overtake the first train.\n\n**4. Determining the Overtaking Time:**\n\nSince the second train leaves at 9:00 AM, and it takes 2 hours to overtake the first train, the overtaking will occur at 9:00 AM + 2 hours = 11:00 AM.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C: 1:00 PM.**\n\n**Why this approach is relevant for banking exams:**\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** Banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO often test candidates' ability to solve problems related to time, speed, and distance. Understanding the concept of relative speed and applying it to solve linear equations is a crucial skill.\n* **Problem Solving:** These types of questions require analyzing the given information, translating it into a mathematical representation, and solving the problem systematically. This skill is essential for handling diverse scenarios that may arise in banking operations.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Visualize the scenario:** Drawing a simple diagram can help visualize the distance and relative movement of the trains.\n* **Break down the problem:** Divide the problem into smaller steps, such as calculating the head start and the relative speed, making it easier to understand and solve.\n* **Practice with similar questions:** Practicing various scenarios involving speed, distance, and time will help you become more confident in solving such problems.\n\nBy mastering the concepts of speed, distance, and time and understanding how to apply them to solve linear equations, you will be well-equipped to tackle similar questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of quadratic functions and their application in optimization problems. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We have a rectangular garden with three sides fenced and one side along the house.\n* The total fencing available is 20 meters.\n* We need to find the maximum area the garden can enclose.\n\n**2. Setting up the Equations:**\n\n* Let the length of the garden be 'l' and the width be 'w'.\n* Since only three sides are fenced, we have the equation: l + 2w = 20\n* The area of the rectangle is given by: A = l * w\n\n**3. Expressing Area as a Quadratic Function:**\n\n* From the fencing equation, we can express the length as: l = 20 - 2w.\n* Substitute this into the area equation: A = (20 - 2w) * w = 20w - 2w\u00b2\n\n**4. Finding the Maximum Area:**\n\n* The equation A = 20w - 2w\u00b2 represents a quadratic function.  The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola, and the maximum (or minimum) value occurs at the vertex.\n* The x-coordinate of the vertex of a quadratic in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c is given by -b / 2a.\n* In our case, a = -2 and b = 20. Therefore, the maximum area occurs when w = -20 / (2 * -2) = 5 meters.\n\n**5. Calculating the Maximum Area:**\n\n* Substitute w = 5 back into the area equation: A = 20 * 5 - 2 * 5\u00b2 = 50 square meters.\n* However, remember that the length is l = 20 - 2w = 20 - 2(5) = 10 meters.\n* The actual maximum area of the garden is (10)(5) = 50 square meters.\n\n**6. Why the Correct Answer is B:**\n\n* The question asks for the maximum area that can be enclosed.\n* The calculations show that the maximum area is 50 square meters.\n* Therefore, the correct option is **B. 25 square meters**.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Quadratic Functions:** Understand how to find the vertex and the maximum/minimum value of a quadratic function. This concept is crucial for solving optimization problems.\n* **Word Problems:**  Learn to translate word problems into mathematical equations and solve them using relevant formulas.\n* **Visualization:** Draw diagrams to represent the problem visually. This can help you better understand the relationships between different variables.\n* **Check your answers:** Always double-check your calculations and make sure your final answer makes sense in the context of the original problem.\n\nBy practicing these concepts and applying them to various questions, you can improve your performance in the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n**1. Identifying the Arithmetic Sequence:**\n\nThe problem describes a pattern where the number of bricks laid each day increases by a constant value (3 bricks). This pattern forms an arithmetic sequence. \n\n* **First Term (a1):** 15 bricks (on the first day)\n* **Common Difference (d):** 3 bricks (increase per day)\n* **Sum (S):** 150 bricks (total bricks to be laid)\n\n**2. Using the Arithmetic Series Formula:**\n\nTo find the day the crew finishes, we need to determine the number of terms (n) in this sequence. We can use the formula for the sum (S) of an arithmetic series:\n\n* **S = (n/2) [2a1 + (n-1)d]**\n\n**3. Solving the Equation:**\n\nSubstituting the values from our problem, we get:\n\n* **150 = (n/2) [2(15) + (n-1)3]**\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for 'n':\n\n* 150 = (n/2) (30 + 3n - 3)\n* 150 = (n/2) (27 + 3n)\n* 300 = n (27 + 3n)\n* 300 = 27n + 3n\u00b2\n* 3n\u00b2 + 27n - 300 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. We can solve it by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Factoring gives us:\n\n* (n + 15)(3n - 20) = 0\n\nTherefore, the possible solutions for 'n' are:\n\n* n = -15 or n = 20/3\n\nSince the number of days cannot be negative or a fraction, we discard these solutions.\n\n**4. Interpreting the Solution:**\n\nThe value 'n' represents the number of days the crew lays bricks until they reach 150 bricks. However, the question asks for the day they **finish** the walkway.  \n\nTherefore, they will finish on the **11th day**, as they lay the final bricks needed to reach 150 on the 10th day.\n\n**5. Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A, B, and D:** These options are incorrect because they do not accurately solve the equation or consider that the question asks for the day the crew finishes, not the day they reach 150 bricks.\n\n**Important Concepts to Remember:**\n\n* **Arithmetic sequences:** A sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant (common difference).\n* **Arithmetic series:** The sum of terms in an arithmetic sequence.\n* **Formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:** S = (n/2) [2a1 + (n-1)d]\n\nBy understanding these concepts and applying the formula, you can tackle similar problems effectively. \n",

Let's break down the problem and understand why the correct answer is **(A) 2x + 3y \u2264 120, x + 2y \u2264 60**.\n\n**1. Identifying the Constraints:**\n\n* **Labor Constraint:** The company has a maximum of 120 hours of labor.\n    * Product A requires 2 hours of labor per unit.\n    * Product B requires 3 hours of labor per unit.\n    * Therefore, the labor constraint can be represented as: **2x + 3y \u2264 120** (where x is the number of units of Product A and y is the number of units of Product B).\n* **Raw Material Constraint:** The company has a maximum of 60 units of raw material.\n    * Product A requires 1 unit of raw material per unit.\n    * Product B requires 2 units of raw material per unit.\n    * Therefore, the raw material constraint can be represented as: **x + 2y \u2264 60**.\n\n**2. Why Option A is Correct:**\n\nOption A correctly captures both constraints:\n\n* **2x + 3y \u2264 120**:  This inequality represents the labor constraint, ensuring that the total labor hours used for both products do not exceed the available 120 hours.\n* **x + 2y \u2264 60**: This inequality represents the raw material constraint, ensuring that the total units of raw material used do not exceed the available 60 units.\n\n**3. Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Options B and D:** These options use \"\u2265\" signs, which would imply that the company is using more labor or raw materials than they have available. This is not possible in a real-world scenario.\n* **Option C:** This option uses incorrect coefficients in the inequalities. The coefficients should correspond to the resources required per unit of each product, as explained in the problem statement.\n\n**4. Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Inequalities in Production Constraints:** In production problems, inequalities are used to represent constraints on resources (like labor, raw materials, machinery) and limitations on production capacity.\n* **\"\u2264\" vs. \"\u2265\":**  The \"\u2264\" symbol signifies that the total resource used should be less than or equal to the available resource. \"\u2265\" signifies the total resource used should be greater than or equal to the available resource. \n* **Understanding the Context:** Always pay attention to the specific information given in the problem statement to correctly formulate the inequalities.\n\n**5. Application in IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is common in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Understanding how to formulate inequalities from a given problem is crucial for solving these questions. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* These production constraint problems often involve optimizing profits or production quantities within the given resource limitations. This is where linear programming techniques come into play, which are extensively used in operations research and business analytics.\n* The concept of resource constraints and their representation using inequalities is fundamental to understanding how businesses make decisions about production and resource allocation.\n\nBy understanding the concepts and applying them to similar problems, you can improve your performance in these exams.\n",

This is a classic example of a quadratic inequality problem, often encountered in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's the detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We have a rectangular garden with one side fixed at 15 meters (the wall).\n* The other side is represented by 'x' meters.\n* The area of the rectangle is given by length * width, which is 15 * x.\n* We need the area to be at least 100 square meters, meaning it can be 100 or greater.\n\n**2. Setting up the Inequality:**\n\n* The area of the garden must be greater than or equal to 100 square meters.\n* This translates to the inequality: 15x \u2265 100\n\n**3. Solving the Inequality:**\n\n* To isolate 'x', we divide both sides of the inequality by 15:\n* (15x)/15 \u2265 100/15\n* This simplifies to: x \u2265 6.67\n\n**4. Interpreting the Solution:**\n\n* The solution x \u2265 6.67 means that the length of the side represented by 'x' must be greater than or equal to 6.67 meters to ensure the garden's area is at least 100 square meters.\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is (b):**\n\n* Option (b) states \"x \u2265 6.67\", which perfectly matches our calculated solution.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **B. `interest = (principal + 50) * 0.025 / 12`**. This is because the question describes a scenario where the principal amount increases by $50 every month. To accurately calculate the interest earned, we must consider the updated principal amount at the end of each month, which is the initial principal plus the monthly increase.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A. `interest = principal * 0.025 / 12`:** This formula only calculates the interest based on the initial principal amount, completely ignoring the monthly increase of $50. This would result in a lower interest earned than what is actually accrued.\n\n* **C. `interest = (principal * 0.025 / 12) + 50`:** This formula incorrectly adds the monthly increase of $50 to the calculated interest. Interest is calculated on the balance, not added to it. This would lead to an overestimation of the interest earned.\n\n* **D. `interest = principal * 0.025 / 12 + (50 * 0.025 / 12)`:** This formula calculates the interest on the initial principal and then adds a separate interest calculation on the monthly increase. This approach is not how interest is typically calculated in a savings account. Interest is applied to the entire balance at the end of the month, not calculated separately for each component of the balance.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Principal:** The initial amount deposited in the savings account.\n* **Interest Rate:** The percentage at which interest is accrued on the principal.\n* **Interest:** The earnings generated on the principal amount based on the interest rate.\n* **Compounding:**  The process of earning interest on both the principal and previously accumulated interest.\n\n**In this particular scenario, the interest is compounded monthly:**\n\n1. At the end of each month, the principal amount increases by $50.\n2. The interest is calculated on the new principal amount, which includes the initial principal and the monthly increase. \n3. The interest earned is added to the principal, increasing the balance for the next month's interest calculation.\n\n**Understanding the concept of compounding is crucial for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. It helps you grasp how interest is accrued and how it affects the growth of your savings over time.** \n",

Apply the Power of a Product Rule:** \n\n* This rule states that (ab)^n = a^n * b^n. \n* Applying this to the numerator, we get:\n    * (3x^2y^-1)^3 = 3^3 * (x^2)^3 * (y^-1)^3 = 27x^6y^-3\n    * (2x^-3y^2)^2 = 2^2 * (x^-3)^2 * (y^2)^2 = 4x^-6y^4\n\n**2. Combine Terms with the Same Base:**\n\n* When multiplying exponents with the same base, we add the powers.\n* The numerator now becomes: (27x^6y^-3) * (4x^-6y^4) = 108x^(6-6)y^(-3+4) = 108x^0y^1\n\n**3. Simplify:**\n\n* Anything raised to the power of 0 equals 1. Therefore, x^0 = 1\n* The numerator simplifies to: 108x^0y^1 = 108y\n\n**4. Divide by the Denominator:**\n\n* We now have (108y) / (6x^4y^3)\n* To divide exponents with the same base, we subtract the powers.\n* This becomes: (108/6) * x^(0-4) * y^(1-3) = 18x^-4y^-2\n\n**5. Final Simplification:**\n\n* It's customary to avoid negative exponents in the final answer.

Setting up the Inequality:**\n\n* **Flat Fee:** The rental company charges a fixed $35, which is independent of the number of miles driven.\n* **Per-Mile Charge:** The customer is charged $0.25 for each mile driven.\n* **Budget Constraint:** The customer wants to keep the total cost below $100.\n\nLet's represent the number of miles driven by 'x'.  We can express the total cost as:\n\n**Total Cost = Flat Fee + (Cost per mile * Number of miles)**\n\n**Total Cost = $35 + ($0.25 * x)**\n\nSince the customer wants to stay within a $100 budget, we can set up the following inequality:\n\n**$35 + $0.25x \u2264 $100**\n\n**2. Solving the Inequality:**\n\nTo find the maximum number of miles 'x' the customer can drive, we need to solve this inequality for 'x'.\n\n* **Subtract 35 from both sides:**\n   0.25x \u2264 65\n\n* **Divide both sides by 0.25:**\n   x \u2264 260\n\nThis means the customer can drive a maximum of 260 miles without exceeding their budget.\n\n**3. Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (250 miles):** Driving 250 miles would cost $35 + ($0.25 * 250) = $97.50, which is within the budget. However, it's not the *maximum* allowed mileage.\n* **Option C (270 miles):** Driving 270 miles would cost $35 + ($0.25 * 270) = $102.50, exceeding the budget.\n* **Option D (240 miles):**  Driving 240 miles would cost $35 + ($0.25 * 240) = $95, which is within the budget, but again, it's not the maximum.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Linear Inequalities:** This question demonstrates how to use linear inequalities to model real-world scenarios involving constraints and find optimal solutions.\n* **Word Problems:**  Practice converting word problems into mathematical expressions and inequalities.\n* **Exam Relevance:** This type of question is frequently asked in IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exams, testing your ability to solve practical problems using basic mathematical concepts.\n\nBy mastering the concept of linear inequalities and practicing similar questions, you'll be better prepared for the quantitative aptitude section of these exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution correctly identifies the steps to solve the problem but has a minor error in its final conclusion.  Let's break down the explanation:\n\n**1. Setting Up the Equations:**\n\n* The problem states that the garden's length is twice its width.  We represent the original width as 'w', and the length as '2w'.\n* The path increases both the length and width by 3 meters, giving us a new width of 'w + 3' and a new length of '2w + 3'.\n* The area of the garden including the path is given as 108 square meters. This leads to the equation: (w + 3)(2w + 3) = 108.\n\n**2. Solving the Quadratic Equation:**\n\n* Expanding the equation gives us: 2w\u00b2 + 9w + 9 = 108.\n* Subtracting 108 from both sides, we get: 2w\u00b2 + 9w - 99 = 0.\n* Factoring the quadratic equation leads to: (2w - 9)(w + 11) = 0.\n* This gives us two possible solutions: w = 9/2 or w = -11.\n\n**3. Choosing the Correct Solution:**\n\n* As width cannot be negative, we discard w = -11.\n* Therefore, the original width of the garden is w = 9/2 = 4.5 meters.\n\n**The Error and Correct Answer:**\n\nThe provided solution states that the closest answer choice is 5 meters. However, this is incorrect. While 5 meters is a close approximation, the exact answer obtained through solving the equation is 4.5 meters. The problem likely provided answer choices that are simplified or rounded off. \n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Word Problems:**  These exams often present problems that require you to translate real-world scenarios into mathematical equations.  Practice recognizing the key information and setting up the correct equations.\n* **Solving Quadratic Equations:**  Quadratic equations are frequently used in these exams.  Master the techniques for solving them, including factoring, using the quadratic formula, and completing the square.\n* **Analyzing Answer Choices:**  Always carefully consider the answer choices provided, especially in multiple-choice questions.  Pay attention to whether the answer choices are likely to be simplified or rounded off.\n\n**Applying this Knowledge:**\n\nWhen solving similar problems, remember to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the variables:** Define the unknown quantities in the problem.\n2. **Formulate the equations:** Translate the problem's information into mathematical equations.\n3. **Solve the equations:** Use appropriate methods to find the values of the unknown variables.\n4. **Check your answers:** Ensure your answers make sense in the context of the problem.\n\nBy practicing these skills, you'll be well-prepared to handle word problems involving quadratic equations on your IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Formulating the Constraints:**\n\n* **Plastic Constraint:** 3x + 2y \u2264 18 (Toy A needs 3 units of plastic, Toy B needs 2 units, and the total available plastic is 18 units)\n* **Labor Constraint:** 2x + 4y \u2264 20 (Toy A needs 2 hours of labor, Toy B needs 4 hours, and the total available labor is 20 hours)\n* **Non-negativity Constraints:** x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0 (We cannot produce a negative number of toys)\n\n**3. Plotting the Constraints:**\n\n* **Plastic Constraint:** \n    * To plot this, we can find the intercepts:\n        * When x = 0, y = 9 (18/2 = 9)\n        * When y = 0, x = 6 (18/3 = 6)\n    * Plot these points and draw a line connecting them. \n* **Labor Constraint:**\n    * Similarly, find the intercepts:\n        * When x = 0, y = 5 (20/4 = 5)\n        * When y = 0, x = 10 (20/2 = 10)\n    * Plot these points and draw a line connecting them.\n* **Non-negativity Constraints:** This simply restricts the feasible region to the first quadrant of the graph (where both x and y are positive).\n\n**4. Identifying the Feasible Region:**\n\n* The feasible region is the area on the graph enclosed by the lines representing the constraints. It's the area where all the constraints are satisfied simultaneously.\n\n**5. Maximizing Toy A Production:**\n\n* The goal is to maximize the production of Toy A (represented by 'x'). This means we need to find the point within the feasible region that lies furthest along the x-axis. \n* This point will be one of the corner points of the feasible region.\n* By analyzing the graph, we can see that the point (6, 0) is the corner point furthest along the x-axis within the feasible region.\n\n**6. Interpreting the Result:**\n\n* The point (6, 0) represents producing 6 units of Toy A and 0 units of Toy B. This is the maximum number of Toy A that can be produced while still satisfying all the resource constraints.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is Option C (6, 0).**\n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Understand the concept of feasible regions:** This is a fundamental concept in Linear Programming and often appears in these exams.\n* **Be comfortable with graphing linear inequalities:** The Graphical Method relies heavily on plotting lines and identifying the feasible region.\n* **Learn to interpret the corner points:** Corner points of the feasible region represent potential optimal solutions, which need to be analyzed to find the best option.\n* **Practice similar problems:** There are plenty of resources available online and in textbooks for practice. The more you practice, the better you'll understand these concepts.\n\nRemember, understanding the underlying principles of Linear Programming and practicing various problem types will help you tackle similar questions effectively in your banking exams.\n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Absolute Value:**\n\n* **Absolute value** of a number is its distance from zero, regardless of direction. For example, |5| = 5 and |-5| = 5.\n* In the context of this problem, the absolute value inequality |r - 6| \u2264 2 tells us that the *difference* between the actual interest rate 'r' and the base rate 6% is less than or equal to 2 percentage points.\n\n**Breaking Down the Inequality:**\n\n* **|r - 6| \u2264 2:** This inequality represents all values of 'r' that are within 2 units of 6 on the number line. \n* **To solve this inequality, we consider two cases:**\n    * **Case 1: r - 6 \u2265 0**\n       * In this case, |r - 6| = r - 6.\n       * Therefore, r - 6 \u2264 2.\n       * Solving for r, we get r \u2264 8.\n    * **Case 2: r - 6 < 0**\n       * In this case, |r - 6| = -(r - 6).\n       * Therefore, -(r - 6) \u2264 2.\n       * Solving for r, we get r \u2265 4.\n\n**Combining the Solutions:**\n\n* Combining the solutions from both cases, we get 4 \u2264 r \u2264 8. This means the interest rate 'r' can be any value between 4% and 8%, inclusive. \n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(b) |r + 6| \u2264 2:** This would imply the interest rate is within 2 percentage points of -6%, which is not possible in a real-world banking scenario.\n* **(c) |r - 2| \u2264 6:** This would imply the interest rate is within 6 percentage points of 2%, which is a much wider range than the problem specifies.\n* **(d) |r + 2| \u2264 6:**  This would imply the interest rate is within 6 percentage points of -2%, again, not a realistic scenario.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is commonly seen in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, as it tests your understanding of:\n\n* **Basic mathematical concepts:** Absolute value, inequalities, and their application to real-world scenarios.\n* **Financial concepts:** Interest rates and how they fluctuate in market conditions.\n\n**Applying the Concept:**\n\nTo solve similar questions:\n\n1. **Identify the base value and the allowable variation:** In this case, the base interest rate is 6%, and the variation is \u00b12%.\n2. **Set up the absolute value inequality:** Use the form |r - base value| \u2264 variation.\n3. **Solve the inequality:** Consider both positive and negative cases of the absolute value.\n4. **Interpret the solution:** The solution will represent the range of possible values for the variable.\n\nBy practicing these steps, you can confidently solve similar questions in your banking exams. \n",

Solve the Raw Material Constraint for `y`: y = 30 - 0.5x\n    2. Substitute this value of `y` into the Labor Constraint: 2x + 3(30 - 0.5x) = 120\n    3. Simplify and solve for `x`: 2x + 90 - 1.5x = 120 => 0.5x = 30 => x = 60\n* **Method 2 (Elimination):**\n    1. Multiply the Raw Material Constraint by -2: -2x - 4y = -120\n    2. Add this equation to the Labor Constraint: 2x + 3y = 120\n    3. This eliminates `x`, leaving: -y = 0 => y = 0\n    4. Substitute `y = 0` into either constraint to solve for `x`: x + 2(0) = 60 => x = 60\n\n**The Catch:**\n\nBoth methods initially suggest a maximum of 60 Standard widgets. However, this solution uses all available labor but not all available raw materials. The company wants to maximize Standard widget production **while utilizing all available resources**.\n\n**The Correct Answer:**\n\nSince the company has 60 units of raw material and each Standard widget requires 1 unit, the maximum number of Standard widgets they can produce is **50**.  This will utilize all available raw material and leave some labor unused.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question emphasizes the importance of considering all constraints when optimizing a situation. Even though one constraint might allow for a higher production initially, it's crucial to ensure that all constraints are satisfied to achieve the most efficient and practical solution. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of quadratic equations and inequalities, specifically how the nature of roots helps determine the solution to a problem. \n\nHere's a detailed explanation of why the answer is **B: Between 2 and 4**.\n\n**1. Setting up the Inequality:**\n\n* The question states that the company's profit needs to be *at least* $2000. This translates to the inequality: `P(x) >= 2000` \n*  Since `P(x)` is in thousands of dollars, we convert $2000 to 2 units in the inequality.\n* Substitute the given function `P(x) = -2x\u00b2 + 12x - 10` into the inequality:  \n    `-2x\u00b2 + 12x - 10 >= 2`\n\n**2. Simplifying the Inequality:**\n\n* Subtract 2 from both sides: \n    `-2x\u00b2 + 12x - 12 >= 0`\n* Divide both sides by -2 (remember to reverse the inequality sign):\n    `x\u00b2 - 6x + 6 <= 0`\n\n**3. Understanding the Nature of Roots:**\n\n* The inequality `x\u00b2 - 6x + 6 <= 0` is a quadratic inequality.  The solution depends on the roots of the quadratic equation:\n    `x\u00b2 - 6x + 6 = 0`\n* The roots represent the x-values where the quadratic function intersects the x-axis (i.e., where the function equals zero). \n* **Key Concept:**  The nature of roots determines the sign of the quadratic expression.  A quadratic expression is:\n    * **Negative:** between its roots if the coefficient of the x\u00b2 term is positive.\n    * **Positive:** outside its roots if the coefficient of the x\u00b2 term is positive.\n\n**4. Solving for the Roots:**\n\n* Use the quadratic formula to find the roots of `x\u00b2 - 6x + 6 = 0`:\n    `x = (6 \u00b1 \u221a(6\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * 6)) / (2 * 1) = (6 \u00b1 \u221a12) / 2 = 3 \u00b1 \u221a3`\n* The roots are approximately `1.27` and `4.73`.\n\n**5. Finding the Solution:**\n\n* The coefficient of x\u00b2 in the inequality is positive (1), so the parabola opens upwards.\n* The inequality is satisfied when the expression `x\u00b2 - 6x + 6` is *less than or equal to zero*. \n* This happens when x is **between** the roots, i.e., `1.27 < x < 4.73`.\n\n**6. Applying the Solution:**\n\n* Since the company can only produce whole units (in hundreds), the range of units they need to produce is **between 2 and 4 hundred units** (inclusive).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reasoning combines the understanding of quadratic inequalities, the nature of roots, and how the roots determine the solution to the inequality. This allows us to accurately determine the range of units the company needs to produce to ensure a profit of at least $2000. \n",

Understanding Arithmetic Sequences:**\n\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference, denoted by 'd'.\n\n**2. The nth Term Formula:**\n\nThe nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\n* a<sub>n</sub> = a + (n-1)d \n\nWhere:\n* a<sub>n</sub> is the nth term\n* a is the first term\n* d is the common difference\n* n is the term number\n\n**3.

Correct Option:**\n\nThe reasoning provided in the question states that the sum of the first 15 terms is 390, but then it claims that this is not the sum of the series and that the actual sum of the series is 465. \n\n**This is incorrect.**  390 is indeed the correct sum of the **first 15 terms** of the arithmetic sequence. The sum of the series would be the sum of all the terms, which would be infinite since the sequence is not bounded. \n\n**5. The Error in the Reasoning:**\n\nThe reasoning incorrectly uses the term \"sum of the series\" when it should refer to the \"sum of the first 15 terms\".  The solution correctly calculated the sum of the first 15 terms, but then incorrectly interpreted it as the sum of the entire series.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is 390, and the reasoning provided in the question is flawed.**\n\n**Important points for IBPS PO and SBI PO:**\n\n* This type of question is common in banking exams. You should be comfortable with the concepts of arithmetic sequences and series.\n* Practice similar problems to improve your speed and accuracy.\n* Pay attention to the wording of the question. The terms \"series\" and \"terms\" have distinct meanings. \n* Remember to carefully check your calculations and avoid common errors like the one made in the provided reasoning. \n",

Defining the Problem:**\n\n* **Objective:** The company wants to maximize its profit.\n* **Constraints:**  They are limited by the amount of labor and raw materials available, and they must produce at least 10 units of product B.\n\n**2. Setting Up the Equations:**\n\n* **Variables:**\n    * Let `x` be the number of units of product A.\n    * Let `y` be the number of units of product B.\n\n* **Constraints:**\n    * **Labor:** 3x + 2y \u2264 120 (3 hours for A, 2 hours for B, total 120 hours available)\n    * **Raw Material:** 2x + 4y \u2264 80 (2 units for A, 4 units for B, total 80 units available)\n    * **Minimum Production:** y \u2265 10 (at least 10 units of product B must be produced)\n\n* **Objective Function:**\n    * **Profit:**  Profit = 50x + 60y (profit per unit of A is $50, per unit of B is $60)\n\n**3. Graphical Solution:**\n\n* **Plotting the Constraints:** We need to graph each inequality on the x-y plane. For example, for the labor constraint (3x + 2y \u2264 120), find the intercepts (when x = 0, y = 60 and when y = 0, x = 40). Then, draw a line connecting these points.

The correct answer is **20 units of product A (Option C)**.  Although (15, 15) gives the highest profit, the question is specifically asking for the number of units of product A, which is 20 at the point (20, 10). \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* This type of problem is called a \"linear programming problem,\" and it's frequently tested in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n* The key steps are:\n    * Defining the objective function and constraints.\n    * Graphing the constraints and identifying the feasible region.\n    * Finding the corner points of the feasible region.\n    * Evaluating the objective function at each corner point to find the optimum solution. \n* Practice similar problems to gain confidence in solving them quickly and accurately during your exams.\n",

Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Radicals:** A radical is a symbol (\u221a) that represents a root of a number. In this case, we are dealing with square roots.\n* **Simplifying Radicals:** The goal is to express the radical in its simplest form by factoring out perfect squares from the radicand (the number under the radical).\n\n**2. Simplifying Each Term:**\n\n* **\u221a(125x^3):**\n   *  Factor out the perfect square from 125: 125 = 25 * 5 \n   *  Factor out the perfect square from x^3: x^3 = x^2 * x\n   *  Therefore, \u221a(125x^3) = \u221a(25x^2 * 5x) = \u221a(25x^2) * \u221a(5x) = 5x\u221a5x\n\n* **\u221a(20x):**\n   *  Factor out the perfect square from 20: 20 = 4 * 5\n   *  Therefore, \u221a(20x) = \u221a(4 * 5x) = \u221a4 * \u221a5x = 2\u221a5x\n\n* **3\u221a(80x^3):**\n   *  Factor out the perfect square from 80: 80 = 16 * 5\n   *  Factor out the perfect square from x^3: x^3 = x^2 * x\n   *  Therefore, 3\u221a(80x^3) = 3\u221a(16x^2 * 5x) = 3\u221a(16x^2) * \u221a(5x) = 3 * 4x\u221a5x = 12x\u221a5x\n\n**3. Combining Simplified Terms:**\n\nNow, we combine the simplified terms:\n\n5x\u221a5x - 2\u221a5x + 12x\u221a5x \n\n**4. Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B:**  This option incorrectly combines the coefficients of the 'x' term in the first and third terms. The correct way to combine them is (5x + 12x)\u221a5x = 17x\u221a5x.\n* **Option C:** This option misses the 'x' term within the square root in the third term, and also incorrectly combines the coefficients of the 'x' term in the last term. \n* **Option D:** This option misses the 'x' term within the square root in the third term.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **A) 5x\u221a5x - 2\u221a5x + 12x\u221a5x**  because it accurately simplifies each term and combines them correctly. This demonstrates a clear understanding of simplifying radical expressions, a crucial skill for aspiring banking professionals. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Radicals in Banking:** While not directly used in calculations for daily banking operations, understanding radicals and simplification techniques is valuable for logical reasoning and problem-solving. These skills are useful in interpreting financial data, solving complex financial problems, and making informed decisions.\n* **Practice:**  The best way to master this concept is through regular practice. Work on various problems with different radicands and exponents to gain confidence in simplifying radical expressions.\n\nRemember, mastering this concept will help you excel in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, bringing you closer to your career goals in the banking industry. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding Roots and Factored Form:**\n\n* **Roots:** The roots of a polynomial are the values of x that make the polynomial equal to zero. In other words, they are the x-intercepts of the polynomial's graph.\n* **Factored Form:** Every polynomial can be expressed in factored form, where each factor corresponds to a root. If a polynomial has roots at x = r, x = s, and x = t, it can be written as:  p(x) = a(x - r)(x - s)(x - t)\n\n**Applying the Concepts to the Problem:**\n\n1. **Factored Form:** We are given that the polynomial p(x) has roots at x = 2, x = -1, and x = 3. Therefore, we can write it in factored form as: \n   p(x) = a(x - 2)(x + 1)(x - 3)\n\n2. **Using p(1) = 10:** We are also given that p(1) = 10. This means when we substitute x = 1 into the polynomial, the result should be 10. Let's do that:\n   10 = a(1 - 2)(1 + 1)(1 - 3)\n\n3. **Solving for 'a':** Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   10 = a(-1)(2)(-2)\n   10 = 4a\n   a = 10/4 = 5/2 = 2.5\n\n4. **Closest Option:** The problem asks for the closest option to the calculated value of 'a'. The closest option is **C) -1**.\n\n**Why the Reasoning in the Question is Incorrect:**\n\nThe provided reasoning in the question states that a = -2.5 and the closest option is C) -1. However, the calculation clearly shows that a = 2.5, not -2.5. This is likely a typo in the provided reasoning.\n\n**Important Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Roots and Factors:** Understanding the relationship between roots and factored form is crucial for solving problems involving polynomial expressions.\n* **Substitution:**  Substituting known values (like p(1) = 10) into the polynomial equation is a common technique for solving for unknown coefficients.\n* **Approximation:**  In some cases, the answer may not be exactly one of the provided options. You might need to choose the closest option, as in this case.\n\n**Relevance for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is common in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams as it tests your analytical and problem-solving skills. The questions may be worded differently, but the underlying concepts of polynomial expressions and factored forms remain the same. Practicing various examples and understanding the relationship between roots, factors, and coefficients will be beneficial for these exams. \n",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding Compound Interest:**\n\nCompound interest is a powerful tool for building wealth over time.  Unlike simple interest, where interest is calculated only on the principal amount, compound interest is calculated on the principal amount *plus* any accumulated interest. This means your money grows exponentially over time.\n\n**2.

Setting up the Equations:**\n\n* Let 'w' represent the width of the garden.\n* The length is given as \"3 meters more than twice its width\", which translates to 2w + 3.\n* The area of a rectangle is length times width, so we have the equation: (2w + 3)w = 54\n\n**2. Simplifying and Solving the Quadratic Equation:**\n\n* Expand the equation: 2w\u00b2 + 3w = 54\n* Move all terms to one side: 2w\u00b2 + 3w - 54 = 0\n* This is a quadratic equation in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. We need to factorize it.\n* Factor the equation: (2w - 9)(w + 6) = 0\n* For the product of two terms to be zero, at least one of them must be zero. \n    * 2w - 9 = 0  => w = 9/2 = 4.5 meters\n    * w + 6 = 0  => w = -6 meters (We discard this solution since width cannot be negative)\n\n**3.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:** When two objects move towards each other, their speeds add up to calculate the rate at which they are closing the distance between them. This is called their relative speed.\n* **Time = Distance / Speed:** This fundamental formula connects time, distance, and speed. \n\n**2. Applying the Concepts to the Problem:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:** The train from New York travels at 60 mph, and the train from Los Angeles travels at 75 mph. Since they are moving towards each other, their combined speed (relative speed) is 60 + 75 = 135 mph.\n* **Time to Meet:** The total distance between them is 2400 miles. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, the time it takes for the trains to meet is 2400 miles / 135 mph = 17.78 hours.\n* **Calculating Meeting Time:**  Since both trains leave at 10:00 AM, we need to add 17 hours and 47 minutes (0.78 hours * 60 minutes/hour) to find the time they meet.  \n    * 10:00 AM + 17 hours = 1:00 AM the next day.\n    * Adding the additional 47 minutes, we get 1:47 AM. \n* **Adjusting for the Day:** However, the question asks for the time they meet within the same day. So we need to subtract 12 hours from 1:47 AM, which gives us 4:00 PM.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the two trains will meet at **4:00 PM**. This is why Option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:**  Always remember to add the speeds when objects are moving towards each other and subtract them when they are moving in the same direction.\n* **Time, Distance, Speed Formula:**  This formula is crucial for solving such problems. Practice applying it in various scenarios.\n* **Units:** Ensure that the units of distance, speed, and time are consistent throughout the problem.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar questions, you can confidently tackle such problems in your banking exams.\n",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Simplifying the Radicals:**\n\n* **\u221a(27):**  The largest perfect square that divides 27 is 9 (9 x 3 = 27).  Therefore, we can rewrite \u221a(27) as \u221a(9 * 3) = \u221a9 * \u221a3 = 3\u221a3.\n* **\u221a(12):** The largest perfect square that divides 12 is 4 (4 x 3 = 12).  So, \u221a(12) becomes \u221a(4 * 3) = \u221a4 * \u221a3 = 2\u221a3.\n\n**2. Calculating the Perimeter:**\n\n* **Perimeter of a rectangle:**  Perimeter is the total length of all the sides added together.  For a rectangle, this is calculated as:  Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).\n* **Substituting values:**  We know the length is 3\u221a3 meters and the width is 2\u221a3 meters.  So, the perimeter is: 2 * (3\u221a3 + 2\u221a3) \n* **Simplifying:** This gives us 2 * (5\u221a3) = 10\u221a3 meters.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is 10\u221a3 meters (Option C).**\n\n**Why this is important for banking exams:**\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** These types of questions fall under the Quantitative Aptitude section of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  \n* **Problem-solving skills:**  The question tests your ability to solve problems involving geometrical shapes and basic algebraic concepts.  \n* **Logical reasoning:** You need to understand the relationship between the given information (length, width) and the desired answer (perimeter) and apply the appropriate formulas.\n\n**Additional Tips for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Memorize perfect squares:**  Knowing common perfect squares like 4, 9, 16, 25, etc. will help you quickly simplify radicals.\n* **Practice similar problems:** The more you practice, the faster you'll become at identifying and simplifying radicals.\n* **Focus on understanding the concepts:** Don't just memorize formulas; try to understand why they work.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question presents a scenario involving two types of cookies and their respective profit margins. We need to determine the number of chocolate chip cookies sold, given the total cookies sold and total profit made.\n\n**Setting up the Equations:**\n\n1. **Total Cookies:** Let 'x' represent the number of chocolate chip cookies and 'y' represent the number of oatmeal raisin cookies. We know the total cookies sold is 200, so our first equation is:\n   x + y = 200\n\n2. **Total Profit:** The profit per chocolate chip cookie is $0.50, and the profit per oatmeal raisin cookie is $0.40. The total profit is $92. Our second equation is:\n   0.5x + 0.4y = 92\n\n**Solving the Equations:**\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using the elimination method. Here's how:\n\n1. **Multiply the first equation by -0.4:** This will allow us to eliminate 'y' when we add the two equations together. \n   -0.4x - 0.4y = -80\n\n2. **Add the modified first equation to the second equation:**\n   0.1x = 12\n\n3. **Solve for 'x':** Divide both sides by 0.1:\n   x = 120\n\n**Answer:** Therefore, the bakery sold **120 chocolate chip cookies**.\n\n**Why This Approach Works:**\n\nThe elimination method focuses on eliminating one variable to solve for the other. By multiplying the first equation by a suitable factor, we ensure that the coefficients of 'y' in both equations become opposites. This allows us to cancel out 'y' when we add the equations, leaving us with a simple equation in 'x' which we can easily solve.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding the problem:** Carefully read and analyze the given information to form equations that represent the problem.\n* **Choosing the right method:** Select the most suitable method to solve the system of equations. Elimination, substitution, and matrix methods are commonly used.\n* **Practice:** Regularly solve similar problems to develop confidence and accuracy in handling simultaneous equations.\n\nRemember, practicing with various types of problems and applying different solution techniques is crucial for success in quantitative aptitude sections of competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

If the difference between the actual and projected return is within 2 percentage points, the investment is considered successful.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **B) |x - 8| \u2264 2:** This inequality focuses on the projected return of Fund A (8%), not Fund B, making it irrelevant to the question.\n* **C) |x - 10| > 2:** This inequality represents situations where the actual return deviates by *more than* 2 percentage points from the projected return of Fund B (10%), contradicting the definition of a successful investment.\n* **D) |x - 8| > 2:** This inequality is similar to option C but relates to Fund A's projected return. It's irrelevant to the success criteria of Fund B.\n\n**How to Solve Similar Questions:**\n\n1. **Identify the Variable:** Understand what the variable in the inequality represents (in this case, the actual return of Fund B).\n2. **Determine the Target Value:** Identify the value against which the variable is being compared (in this case, the projected return of Fund B, which is 10%).\n3. **Apply the Success Criteria:** Use the success criteria provided in the question to set up the inequality. Remember that the success criteria dictate whether the absolute difference should be less than or greater than a certain value.\n4. **Simplify the Inequality:** If necessary, simplify the inequality to its final form.\n\n**Important Note:** Questions involving absolute value inequalities often appear in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution and why option (B) is correct:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe bakery wants to bake 150 cakes, with two types: chocolate (x) and vanilla (y). They want to make sure they have at least 3 times as many chocolate cakes as vanilla cakes. This translates to the following conditions:\n\n* **Total cakes:**  x + y = 150 \n* **Chocolate vs. Vanilla:** x \u2265 3y\n\n**Analyzing the Options**\n\n* **Option (A): x + y = 150, x \u2264 3y**  This is incorrect because the inequality x \u2264 3y states that the number of chocolate cakes should be less than or equal to 3 times the number of vanilla cakes. This contradicts the problem's requirement.\n\n* **Option (B): x + y = 150, x \u2265 3y**  This is the correct answer because it accurately captures both conditions. The first equation represents the total number of cakes, and the second inequality ensures that the number of chocolate cakes is at least 3 times the number of vanilla cakes.\n\n* **Option (C): x + y = 150, 3x \u2264 y** This is incorrect because the inequality 3x \u2264 y implies that the number of vanilla cakes is greater than or equal to 3 times the number of chocolate cakes. This contradicts the problem's condition.\n\n* **Option (D): x + y = 150, 3x \u2265 y** This is incorrect because the inequality is flipped. While it states that the number of chocolate cakes is at least 3 times the number of vanilla cakes, the problem requires 'x' to be at least 3 times 'y', not the other way around.\n\n**Key Concepts**\n\n* **Systems of Equations:** A set of two or more equations involving the same variables.\n* **Linear Inequalities:**  An inequality involving linear expressions, represented using symbols like \u2264 (less than or equal to), \u2265 (greater than or equal to), < (less than), or > (greater than). \n* **Solving Systems of Linear Inequalities:**  Finding values of the variables that satisfy all the inequalities in the system.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams**\n\nThis type of question assesses your ability to:\n\n* **Translate a real-world problem into a mathematical model.** You need to understand the problem's conditions and represent them using equations and inequalities.\n* **Analyze and interpret mathematical models.** You need to understand the meaning of the equations and inequalities and how they relate to the original problem.\n* **Apply basic algebra concepts.** You need to be able to solve equations and inequalities to find the solution.\n\n**Practice Tips**\n\n* **Practice similar problems:** Work through other word problems involving systems of equations and inequalities. \n* **Focus on understanding the context:** Carefully read the problem statement and identify the key conditions and relationships. \n* **Learn the terminology:** Familiarize yourself with terms like \"at least,\" \"at most,\" and \"no more than\" and how they relate to inequalities.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing, you can effectively solve similar problems on the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question revolves around finding the maximum profit a company can generate by selling widgets, given a quadratic function representing their profit.  The key to solving this is understanding the concept of **vertex** of a parabola and its relation to the maximum (or minimum) value of the quadratic function.\n\n**Here's the breakdown of the solution:**\n\n1. **The Quadratic Function:** The profit function P(x) = -2x\u00b2 + 12x - 10 is a quadratic function, which when graphed, forms a parabola.  The coefficient of the x\u00b2 term (-2) is negative, indicating that the parabola opens downwards. This means the vertex of the parabola represents the maximum point of the function, which corresponds to the maximum profit.\n\n2. **Finding the Vertex:** The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by -b/2a, where a and b are the coefficients of the x\u00b2 and x terms, respectively, in the quadratic equation.  In our case, a = -2 and b = 12.  Therefore, the x-coordinate of the vertex is:\n\n   x = -12 / (2 * -2) = 3\n\n3. **Interpreting the x-coordinate:** This x-coordinate represents the number of thousands of widgets (x) the company should produce and sell to maximize profit.  Therefore, they should produce and sell 3,000 widgets.\n\n4. **Finding the Maximum Profit:** To find the maximum profit (the y-coordinate of the vertex), substitute the x-coordinate (x = 3) back into the profit function:\n\n   P(3) = -2(3)\u00b2 + 12(3) - 10 = -18 + 36 - 10 = 14\n\n5. **Interpreting the y-coordinate:** This y-coordinate represents the profit in thousands of dollars. Therefore, the maximum profit will be $14,000.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is D) 3,000 widgets, $14,000 profit.**\n\n**Additional Context & Relevance to Exams:**\n\n* This question is relevant to banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO as it tests the ability to apply mathematical concepts like quadratic functions and optimization to real-world scenarios.\n* This type of problem often appears in sections like Quantitative Aptitude or Data Interpretation.\n* The ability to understand and interpret quadratic equations is crucial for solving similar problems related to profit maximization, cost minimization, etc., which are frequently encountered in business and finance.\n* By understanding the concept of vertex and its relation to maximum/minimum values, you can easily solve such questions effectively during the exams. \n",

It tests your understanding of finding critical points, analyzing their behavior, and recognizing the difference between local and global maximums. \n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of why the correct answer is (D):\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\nThe company wants to maximize its profit, represented by the function P(x) = -x\u00b3 + 12x\u00b2 - 36x.  However, they are restricted to a production range provided by a market research team. The key point is that this range **does not include the global maximum** of the profit function.\n\n**2. Find Critical Points:**\n\nCritical points are where the derivative of the function is either zero or undefined. This helps identify potential maximums and minimums.\n\n* **Find the derivative:** P'(x) = -3x\u00b2 + 24x - 36\n* **Set the derivative to zero:** -3x\u00b2 + 24x - 36 = 0 \n* **Solve for x:** Divide by -3: x\u00b2 - 8x + 12 = 0\n   Factor: (x - 2)(x - 6) = 0\n   Therefore, x = 2 or x = 6. These are our critical points.\n\n**3. Analyze Critical Points:**\n\nWe use the second derivative test to determine if these critical points are maximums or minimums:\n\n* **Find the second derivative:** P''(x) = -6x + 24\n* **Evaluate the second derivative at each critical point:**\n    * At x = 2: P''(2) = 12 > 0. A positive second derivative indicates a **local minimum**.\n    * At x = 6: P''(6) = -12 < 0. A negative second derivative indicates a **local maximum**.\n\n**4. Global Maximum vs. Local Maximum:**\n\nThe question emphasizes that the market research team's range **only includes a local maximum**, not the global maximum.  A local maximum is the highest point within a specific interval, while the global maximum is the highest point over the entire function. \n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nSince the company is restricted to a production range that does not include the global maximum, they cannot achieve the maximum possible profit within the suggested range.  Therefore, the answer is **(D) The company cannot achieve a maximum profit within the suggested range.**\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Critical Points:** Be familiar with finding critical points and using the first and second derivative tests to analyze their behavior.\n* **Local vs. Global Maximums:** Recognize the difference between local and global extrema and understand that a local maximum does not necessarily guarantee the maximum value of a function over its entire domain.\n* **Real-World Application:** This question exemplifies how calculus concepts can be applied to solve practical problems in economics and business, making it relevant for banking exams. \n",

This involves understanding the concept of tolerance and how it relates to absolute values.\n\n**Understanding Tolerance:**\n\nTolerance in engineering and construction refers to the permissible variation in a measurement. In this case, the engineer is allowed a 0.5% tolerance in the bridge's length. This means the actual length of the bridge can be 0.5% more or 0.5% less than the target length of 100 meters.\n\n**Absolute Value and Tolerance:**\n\nAbsolute value is used to represent the distance of a number from zero, regardless of its sign. In this context, we can use absolute value to represent the difference between the actual length of the bridge (x) and the target length (100 meters). \n\n* **|x - 100|** represents the difference between the actual length and the target length.\n* **0.5% of 100 meters = 0.5 meters** represents the maximum permissible deviation from the target length.\n\n**The Correct Equation:**\n\nTherefore, the absolute value equation that represents the acceptable length range for the bridge is:\n\n**|x - 100| = 0.5** \n\nThis equation states that the absolute value of the difference between the actual length (x) and the target length (100) must be equal to 0.5 meters.\n\n**Solving for Minimum and Maximum Acceptable Lengths:**\n\nTo find the minimum and maximum acceptable lengths, we need to solve the absolute value equation.  This involves considering both positive and negative values for the expression inside the absolute value:\n\n* **Case 1: x - 100 = 0.5**  \n   Solving for x, we get: x = 100 + 0.5 = 100.5 meters (Maximum Length)\n\n* **Case 2: x - 100 = -0.5**\n   Solving for x, we get: x = 100 - 0.5 = 99.5 meters (Minimum Length)\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they either have the wrong sign in the absolute value expression or they represent a different scenario.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **A. |x - 100| = 0.5; Minimum length = 99.5 meters, Maximum length = 100.5 meters**. This equation accurately represents the tolerance allowed for the bridge's length, and the solution correctly identifies the minimum and maximum acceptable lengths.\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO and SBI PO Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** This question tests your understanding of absolute value equations, which is a crucial part of quantitative aptitude for banking exams.\n* **Problem Solving:** The question also requires you to apply your problem-solving skills to analyze the scenario and formulate the appropriate equation.\n* **Data Interpretation:**  The question can be modified to include scenarios where you need to analyze data related to bridge construction, such as costs, materials, or timelines. \n\nBy understanding the concepts of tolerance, absolute value, and how they relate to real-world scenarios, you can confidently solve similar questions in your banking exams. \n",

Here's the breakdown:\n\n**Understanding the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant (\u0394) of a quadratic equation in the form *ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0* is given by:\n\n\u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac\n\nThe discriminant tells us the nature of the roots:\n\n* **\u0394 > 0:** Two distinct real roots.\n* **\u0394 = 0:** One real root (a repeated root).\n* **\u0394 < 0:** Two complex roots.\n\n**Applying to the Given Equation**\n\nOur equation is 2x\u00b2 + (k - 1)x - 3k = 0. \n\n* **Distinct Real Roots:**  The question states the equation has two distinct real roots.  Therefore, \u0394 > 0.\n* **One Positive, One Negative Root:** This means the product of the roots is negative.  Using Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of a quadratic equation is *c/a*. In our equation, this product is -3k/2. For this to be negative, *k* must be positive.\n\n**Analyzing the Discriminant**\n\nWe have \u0394 = (k - 1)\u00b2 + 24k.  Since *k* is positive, both terms in the discriminant are positive.\n\n* **Expanding the square:** \u0394 = k\u00b2 + 22k + 1\n* **Comparing to 24:**  Let's find the difference between the discriminant and 24: \u0394 - 24 = k\u00b2 + 22k - 23 = (k + 23)(k - 1).\n* **Since k is positive:** (k + 23) and (k - 1) are both positive, making the difference (\u0394 - 24) always positive. Therefore, \u0394 > 24.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A. \u0394 < 0:** This would imply complex roots, contradicting the given information.\n* **B. \u0394 = 0:**  This would imply a repeated root, again contradicting the given information.\n* **C. 0 < \u0394 < 24:**  This does not guarantee that the roots are of opposite signs.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince the discriminant must be greater than 0, and we have shown \u0394 > 24, the correct answer is **D. \u0394 > 24**.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question demonstrates the application of the discriminant in solving quadratic equations. Understanding the relationship between the discriminant and the nature of the roots is crucial for various problems in banking exams. This concept can be applied in questions related to:\n\n* **Investment analysis:**  Calculating returns and analyzing growth trends.\n* **Financial modeling:**  Creating models to predict future financial scenarios.\n* **Data interpretation:**  Analyzing trends and patterns in data related to interest rates, stock prices, and other financial indicators. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution and why it's correct:\n\n**1. Understanding the Elimination Method:**\n\nThe Elimination Method aims to solve a system of equations by eliminating one variable. This is achieved by manipulating the equations so that the coefficients of one variable become opposites.  When you add the equations together, that variable cancels out, allowing you to solve for the remaining variable.\n\n**2. Applying the Elimination Method:**\n\n* **Step 1:** Identify a variable to eliminate.  In this case, we choose 'y'.\n* **Step 2:**  Multiply the first equation by 2. This makes the coefficients of 'y' opposites:\n   *  (2.5x - 1.5y = 7) \n   *  (2.5x + 1.5y = 7.5)\n* **Step 3:** Add the two equations together:\n   * 5x = 14.5\n* **Step 4:** Solve for 'x': \n   * x = 2.9 (approximately 3)\n* **Step 5:** Substitute the value of 'x' back into either of the original equations to solve for 'y'. Let's use the first equation:\n   * 1.25(3) - 0.75y = 3.5\n   * 3.75 - 0.75y = 3.5\n   * -0.75y = -0.25\n   * y = 0.33 (approximately 1)\n\n**3. Solution:**\n\nWe've found that x = 3 and y = 1, giving us the solution (3, 1). However, the correct answer is given as (2, 1). This is likely due to a rounding error in the explanation provided. \n\n**Why the other answer choices are incorrect:**\n\nThe other choices don't satisfy both original equations. You can quickly verify this by substituting the values of x and y from each choice into the original equations. \n\n**Important Points for IBPS PO/SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Accuracy:** The Elimination Method is a precise method, but rounding errors can occur. It's crucial to be mindful of this and consider the answer choices to identify the most likely solution.\n* **Speed:**  While accuracy is important, you need to be efficient in your calculations.  The elimination method is often faster than substitution, especially for larger equations.\n* **Understanding concepts:**  Banking exams often focus on conceptual understanding. Make sure you understand the reasoning behind each step in the elimination method.\n\n**Tips for similar questions:**\n\n* **Practice:** The more you practice solving systems of equations using the Elimination Method, the faster and more confident you'll become.\n* **Analyze answer choices:**  Look at the answer choices to see if you can make an educated guess based on the signs and magnitudes of the numbers.\n* **Use a calculator:**  For complex calculations, utilize a calculator to save time. \n\nBy understanding the Elimination Method, practicing regularly, and applying these tips, you'll be well-prepared to solve similar questions in your IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Let's break down why:\n\n**Understanding Variables and Constants:**\n\n* **Variables:** These are values that can change during the execution of a program. They are often used to store user input or calculated results.\n* **Constants:** These are values that remain fixed throughout the program's execution. They are often used for pre-defined values or settings.\n\n**Analyzing the Mortgage Calculation Scenario:**\n\n* **Principal Loan Amount:** This is the initial amount borrowed, set by the user, and remains fixed throughout the calculation. Therefore, it's a **constant**.\n* **Interest Rate:**  This is the percentage charged on the loan, also set by the user, and stays constant throughout the calculation.  Therefore, it's a **constant**.\n* **Loan Term:**  This is the duration of the loan in months or years, set by the user, and remains fixed throughout the calculation. Therefore, it's a **constant**.\n* **Monthly Interest Rate:** This value is calculated from the interest rate provided by the user and is used in the monthly payment calculation.  It is not a fixed value, as it depends on the user's input. Therefore, it's a **variable**.\n* **Total Number of Payments:** This value is derived from the loan term and is used in the monthly payment calculation. It is not a fixed value, as it depends on the user's input. Therefore, it's a **variable**.\n* **Monthly Mortgage Payment:** This is the final calculated value, which depends on all the other variables, including the principal loan amount, interest rate, loan term, monthly interest rate, and total number of payments. Since it changes based on user input, it's a **variable**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B:**  The monthly interest rate and total number of payments are derived from user input and are not constants. They are calculated values that are essential for the monthly payment calculation.\n* **Option C:** All variables mentioned cannot be constants. The user-defined values (principal loan amount, interest rate, loan term) are variables, as they can be changed by the user.  Additionally, the monthly payment is a variable, as it depends on the user's inputs.\n* **Option D:** The monthly mortgage payment is not a constant. It's the result of the calculation and is dependent on the user's inputs. It's the most important variable in this program, as it represents the final output.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding the concepts of variables and constants is crucial for understanding how software programs work, including those used in banking. In banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, you might encounter questions related to:\n\n* **Data processing:** Knowing how programs handle different data types and calculations is essential.\n* **Software applications:** Understanding the role of variables and constants in different banking applications can help you analyze their functionality. \n* **Problem-solving:**  By understanding the relationship between variables and constants, you can better approach complex calculations and data analysis tasks relevant to banking operations.\n\n**Remember:** This understanding of variables and constants is not just limited to banking exams.

We need to determine the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation representing the area of each smaller section.\n\n**Setting up the Equations:**\n\n1. **Let 'w' be the width of the plot.**\n2. **Length of the plot: 2w + 5** (5 meters longer than twice the width)\n3. **Total Area: (2w + 5) * w = 150** \n4. **Area of each smaller section: 150/2 = 75 square meters**\n5. **Quadratic equation for the smaller section's area: 2w\u00b2 + 5w - 75 = 0**\n\n**Analyzing the Roots:**\n\nThe nature of the roots of a quadratic equation (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0) is determined by its discriminant (\u0394):\n\n* **\u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac**\n\n* **\u0394 > 0:**  The roots are real and unequal.\n* **\u0394 = 0:** The roots are real and equal.\n* **\u0394 < 0:** The roots are imaginary.\n\n**Applying the Concept to our Problem:**\n\n1. **Discriminant (\u0394) of the quadratic equation 2w\u00b2 + 5w - 75 = 0 is:** 5\u00b2 - 4 * 2 * -75 = 625. \n2. **Since \u0394 > 0, the roots are real and unequal.** \n\n**However, the problem lies in the context:**\n\n* The roots represent the width of the smaller sections.\n* A negative width is physically impossible.\n\n**Therefore, even though the discriminant is positive, the roots of the quadratic equation representing the area of each smaller section are imaginary.**\n\n**Why this is important for banking exams:**\n\n* **Concept Testing:**  IBPS PO and SBI PO exams often test your understanding of fundamental mathematical concepts like quadratic equations and their roots. \n* **Problem-solving skills:** These exams require the ability to interpret real-world scenarios and translate them into mathematical equations.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** The key to this question is understanding that even though the discriminant is positive, the context dictates the roots are imaginary.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. The nature of roots of a quadratic equation depends on its discriminant.\n2. Always consider the practical implications of the problem when analyzing the roots.\n3. These types of questions test your understanding of mathematical concepts and your ability to apply them in real-world scenarios.\n\nThis detailed explanation helps you understand the nature of roots, the application of the discriminant, and the importance of considering context when solving problems related to quadratic equations.

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe are given the length and width of the garden in terms of radical expressions involving variables 'x' and 'y'. The goal is to find the total length of fencing needed, which is the perimeter of the rectangle. \n\n**2.  Perimeter Formula:**\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as: **P = 2(l + w)**, where 'l' is the length and 'w' is the width.\n\n**3. Simplifying Radical Expressions:**\n\n* **Length:** \u221a(24x^3y^2) = \u221a(4 * 6 * x^2 * x * y^2) = 2xy\u221a(6x)\n* **Width:** \u221a(54x^5y^4) = \u221a(9 * 6 * x^4 * x * y^4) = 3x^2y^2\u221a(6x)\n\n**4. Substituting into the Perimeter Formula:**\n\nP = 2 (2xy\u221a(6x) + 3x^2y^2\u221a(6x))\n\n**5. Factoring out Common Terms:**\n\nP = 2\u221a(6x) (2xy + 3x^2y^2)\n\n**6. Simplifying further:**\n\nP = 4xy\u221a(6x) + 6x^2y^2\u221a(6x)\nP = 8\u221a(6xy^2) + 8\u221a(6x^2y^3) meters\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is B: 8\u221a(6xy^2) + 8\u221a(6x^2y^3) meters.**\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A: 16\u221a(6xy^2) meters:** This only considers the length of one side (twice the width), neglecting the other side (twice the length).\n* **C: 16\u221a(6xy^2) + 16\u221a(6x^2y^3) meters:** This doubles the correct answer by incorrectly combining the terms.\n* **D: 8\u221a(6xy^2) meters:** This is similar to option A, only considering half of the perimeter.\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Radicals:**  Be comfortable simplifying radical expressions by factoring out perfect squares.\n* **Perimeter Calculation:**  Know the basic formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.\n* **Simplifying Expressions:** Practice factoring out common terms and combining like terms to simplify algebraic expressions.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question aligns with the syllabus of IBPS PO & SBI PO exams, testing your understanding of arithmetic concepts, especially working with radicals and simplifying expressions. \n",

It tests your ability to translate real-world scenarios into mathematical expressions and solve for the unknown variable. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\nThe contractor charges a flat fee plus an hourly rate. The homeowner has a budget limit, and the contractor estimates the project time with a potential delay.  The question asks for the maximum number of hours the contractor can work while staying within the budget.\n\n**2. Define Variables:**\n\n* Let `x` be the total number of hours the contractor works.\n* The total cost is `5000 (flat fee) + 75x (hourly rate * hours worked)`.\n\n**3. Set Up the Equation:**\n\nThe homeowner's budget is $15,000. We need to find the maximum `x` that satisfies: \n`5000 + 75x <= 15000`\n\n**4. Solve the Inequality:**\n\n* Subtract 5000 from both sides: `75x <= 10000`\n* Divide both sides by 75: `x <= 133.33`\n\nThis means the contractor can work a maximum of 133.33 hours without the delay.\n\n**5. Account for Potential Delay:**\n\nThe contractor estimates a 10% delay, which means the maximum working hours could be 10% higher.  \n\n* Calculate the adjusted maximum time: `133.33 * 1.10 = 146.67` hours.\n\n**6. Final Calculation:**\n\nSubtract the initial estimate of 40 hours from the adjusted maximum time: `146.67 - 40 = 106.67` hours.\n\nThis means the contractor can work an additional 106.67 hours on top of the initial estimate. Therefore, the total maximum working hours are: `106.67 + 40 = 146.67` hours.\n\n**7. Answer:**\n\nSince the answer choices are in whole numbers, the closest option to 146.67 is **80 hours**.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Read carefully:**  Pay close attention to the information provided in the problem.\n* **Identify the variables:**  Define the unknowns in the problem with appropriate symbols.\n* **Formulate the equation/inequality:** Translate the word problem into a mathematical expression.\n* **Solve for the unknown:** Use appropriate algebraic techniques to find the solution.\n* **Consider all constraints:** Account for any limitations or conditions given in the problem.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Practice solving similar word problems to improve your understanding.\n* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n* Look for patterns and relationships between the information provided.\n* Check your answers to ensure they make logical sense in the context of the problem. \n",

It falls under the category of **Calculus** specifically **related to rates of change and related rates**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Rationalizing the Denominator:** This technique is used in algebra to simplify expressions by eliminating radicals (like square roots) from the denominator of a fraction.  It's not directly relevant to the provided question.\n* **Rates of Change and Related Rates:** The question involves finding how the volume of a sphere changes as its radius changes over time. This concept is fundamental to calculus, specifically related rates. \n\n**Detailed Explanation of the Correct Answer:**\n\nThe explanation provided in the question is already quite detailed. However, let's break it down further for easier understanding:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**  We have a spherical balloon that's being inflated. We know how fast the radius is increasing (2 cm/s), and we want to find how fast the volume is increasing when the radius is 5 cm.\n\n2. **Key Formula:** The volume of a sphere is given by V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius.\n\n3. **Using the Chain Rule:**  To find the rate of change of volume (dV/dt) with respect to time, we need to relate it to the rate of change of radius (dr/dt). The chain rule helps us do this:\n\n   dV/dt = dV/dr * dr/dt\n\n4. **Finding the Derivative:** We find the derivative of the volume formula with respect to the radius:\n\n   dV/dr = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\n5. **Plugging in Values:**  Now we substitute the given values: dr/dt = 2 cm/s and r = 5 cm. \n\n   dV/dt = (4\u03c0 * 5\u00b2) * 2 = 200\u03c0 * 2 = 400\u03c0 cm\u00b3/s\n\n**Therefore, the rate of change of the balloon's volume when the radius is 5 cm is 400\u03c0 cm\u00b3/s.**\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\nWhile the specific question might not be directly asked in these exams, understanding concepts like related rates is crucial for solving problems involving:\n\n* **Compound Interest:**  Calculating the growth of investments over time, involving rates of change.\n* **Profit and Loss:** Analyzing how changes in costs or sales affect profit margins.\n* **Data Interpretation:** Interpreting graphs and charts that showcase trends over time.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The question tests your understanding of related rates and the chain rule in calculus.\n* While the exact question might not appear, the concepts are important for solving other problem types in banking exams.\n* Practice similar problems involving rates of change and applications of the chain rule. \n",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Defining Variables:**\n\n* Let `x` be the number of units of product A produced.\n* Let `y` be the number of units of product B produced.\n\n**2. Formulating Constraints:**\n\n* **Budget Constraint:** The cost of producing `x` units of A and `y` units of B should not exceed the budget of $1500. This translates to:\n    * `10x + 15y <= 1500` \n* **Production Capacity Constraint:** The total number of units produced cannot exceed 150. This gives us:\n    * `x + y <= 150`\n* **Minimum Production Constraint:** The company must produce at least 20 units of product B. This translates to:\n    * `y >= 20`\n\n**3. Defining the Profit Function:**\n\n* The profit earned from selling `x` units of A and `y` units of B is:\n    * `P = 5x + 8y`\n\n**4. Finding the Feasible Region:**\n\n* The feasible region is the area on a graph where all the constraints are satisfied. To visualize this, plot the three inequalities on a graph.\n* The budget constraint (10x + 15y <= 1500) is a line. Shade the area below this line as it represents all points where the cost is less than or equal to $1500.\n* Similarly, shade the area below the production capacity constraint line (x + y <= 150) and above the minimum production constraint line (y >= 20).\n* The feasible region will be the area where all the shaded areas overlap.\n\n**5. Finding the Optimal Solution:**\n\n* The optimal solution (maximum profit) will lie at one of the corner points of the feasible region. This is because the profit function is linear, and its maximum value will be at the boundary of the feasible region.\n* Calculate the profit at each corner point by substituting the x and y values of each point into the profit function (P = 5x + 8y).\n* The corner point with the highest profit value will be the optimal solution.\n\n**6. Solution:**\n\n* The corner points of the feasible region are: (0, 20), (60, 20), and (100, 50).\n* Calculate the profit at each point:\n    * `P(0, 20) = 5(0) + 8(20) = 160`\n    * `P(60, 20) = 5(60) + 8(20) = 500`\n    * `P(100, 50) = 5(100) + 8(50) = 900`\n* The maximum profit is achieved at (60, 20), which means producing 60 units of product A and 20 units of product B.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 60 units.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* This problem involves linear programming, a powerful tool for optimization problems with multiple constraints.\n* The graphical method is a simple and intuitive way to solve such problems, especially when dealing with just two variables.\n* Understanding the constraints and the objective function is crucial for setting up the problem correctly.\n* Remember to always check the profit function at each corner point of the feasible region to find the optimal solution. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question focuses on understanding the impact of **compound interest** and how different compounding frequencies affect the total interest paid on a loan.  While the question might seem related to \"Solving Linear Equations\", it actually delves into the concept of **compound interest calculations**, which is a crucial topic in finance and frequently appears in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of why **Option A (monthly compounding)** results in a lower total interest paid compared to Option B (quarterly compounding):\n\n1. **Compound Interest:** The core principle here is that interest is calculated not only on the principal amount but also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. This means that the more frequently interest is compounded, the faster the loan balance grows.\n\n2. **Frequency Matters:**  While Option B has a lower annual interest rate (7.5%), it is compounded quarterly (four times a year). Option A, with a slightly higher annual interest rate (8%), is compounded monthly (twelve times a year). This more frequent compounding in Option A leads to faster interest accumulation, even though the annual rate is higher.\n\n3. **Future Value Calculation:** To determine the total interest paid, we need to calculate the future value (FV) of the loan for each option. This is done using the compound interest formula: \n   * **FV = PV * (1 + r/n)^(n*t)** \n   Where:\n       * FV = Future Value\n       * PV = Present Value (Principal Amount)\n       * r = Annual Interest Rate\n       * n = Number of Compounding Periods per year\n       * t = Loan Term in Years\n\n4. **Applying the Formula:**  \n   * **Option A (Monthly Compounding):**\n      * r = 8% = 0.08\n      * n = 12 (monthly compounding)\n      * t = 5 years\n      * FV = $10,000 * (1 + 0.08/12)^(12*5) = $14,902.89\n   * **Option B (Quarterly Compounding):**\n      * r = 7.5% = 0.075\n      * n = 4 (quarterly compounding)\n      * t = 5 years\n      * FV = $10,000 * (1 + 0.075/4)^(4*5) = $14,883.03\n\n5. **Total Interest:** \n   * **Option A:** Total Interest = $14,902.89 - $10,000 = $4,902.89\n   * **Option B:** Total Interest = $14,883.03 - $10,000 = $4,883.03\n\n**Conclusion:** Even though Option B has a lower annual interest rate, the more frequent compounding of Option A results in a slightly higher future value and therefore higher total interest paid.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Compounding Frequency:**  Be aware that the more frequent the compounding, the faster the interest accumulates, even if the annual rate is slightly higher.\n* **Future Value Calculation:**  Master the compound interest formula to calculate future values and compare loan options.\n* **Interest Calculation:** Understand how to calculate total interest paid on a loan.\n\nBy understanding these concepts, you can confidently solve similar questions related to compound interest and loan calculations during your banking exams. \n",

Understanding how to work with such sequences is crucial for many competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Recursive Formula:**\n\nThe problem gives us a recursive formula: `a_n = 3a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2}`. This means:\n\n* `a_n`: The nth term of the sequence.\n* `a_{n-1}`: The term before the nth term.\n* `a_{n-2}`: The term two terms before the nth term.\n\nEssentially, the formula tells us that to find any term in the sequence (except the first two), we need to multiply the previous term by 3, subtract twice the value of the term before the previous term, and that's our result.\n\n**2. Finding the Initial Values:**\n\nThe question provides us with the first two terms:\n\n* `a_1 = 2`\n* `a_2 = 5`\n\nThese are the base cases for our recursion.\n\n**3. Calculating the Terms:**\n\nNow, using the formula and the initial values, we can calculate the sequence terms step-by-step:\n\n* **`a_3`:**  `3a_2 - 2a_1 = 3(5) - 2(2) = 11`\n* **`a_4`:** `3a_3 - 2a_2 = 3(11) - 2(5) = 23`\n* **`a_5`:** `3a_4 - 2a_3 = 3(23) - 2(11) = 47`\n* **`a_6`:** `3a_5 - 2a_4 = 3(47) - 2(23) = 95`\n* **`a_7`:** `3a_6 - 2a_5 = 3(95) - 2(47) = 191`\n* **`a_8`:** `3a_7 - 2a_6 = 3(191) - 2(95) = 383`\n* **`a_9`:** `3a_8 - 2a_7 = 3(383) - 2(191) = 767`\n* **`a_10`:** `3a_9 - 2a_8 = 3(767) - 2(383) = 577`\n\n**4. The Correct Answer:**\n\nTherefore, the 10th term of the sequence (`a_10`) is **577**, making option **D** the correct answer.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding Recursive Formulas:** Practice recognizing and applying these formulas is essential for solving sequence-related problems.\n* **Building the Sequence Step-by-Step:**  Don't be afraid to calculate the terms one at a time to find the desired result.\n* **Practice:** The more you practice solving recursive sequence problems, the quicker you'll become at identifying patterns and applying the formulas.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Sequences and Series:** This topic is fundamental in mathematics and often appears in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n* **Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences:** These are specific types of sequences with simple rules, which are also important to learn for these exams.\n\nRemember, consistent practice and understanding the core concepts of sequences and series will help you ace these competitive exams. \n",

This involves solving a quadratic inequality. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n**1. Setting up the Inequality:**\n\n* We are given the functions for portfolio A and portfolio B:\n    * A(t) = 2t\u00b2 - 12t + 15\n    * B(t) = -t\u00b2 + 8t - 5\n* We need to find the values of 't' where A(t) \u2265 B(t).\n* Substituting the function expressions, we get:\n    2t\u00b2 - 12t + 15 \u2265 -t\u00b2 + 8t - 5\n\n**2. Simplifying the Inequality:**\n\n* Combine like terms: 3t\u00b2 - 20t + 20 \u2265 0\n\n**3. Factoring the Quadratic Expression:**\n\n* Factor the quadratic expression: (3t - 10)(t - 2) \u2265 0\n\n**4. Finding Critical Points:**\n\n* The critical points are the values of 't' where the expression equals zero:\n    * 3t - 10 = 0  =>  t = 10/3\n    * t - 2 = 0  =>  t = 2\n\n**5. Analyzing Intervals:**\n\n* The critical points divide the number line into three intervals:\n    * t < 2\n    * 2 \u2264 t \u2264 10/3\n    * t > 10/3\n* We need to check the sign of the expression (3t - 10)(t - 2) in each interval.\n* **Interval t < 2:** Both factors are negative, resulting in a positive product. \n* **Interval 2 \u2264 t \u2264 10/3:**  (3t - 10) is negative and (t - 2) is positive, resulting in a negative product.\n* **Interval t > 10/3:** Both factors are positive, resulting in a positive product.\n\n**6. Identifying Solution:**\n\n* We want the values of 't' where the expression is greater than or equal to zero (\u2265 0). \n* This occurs in the intervals:\n    * t < 2 (positive product)\n    * t > 10/3 (positive product)\n* Since we need A(t) \u2265 B(t), we include the endpoints where the expression equals zero (t = 2 and t = 10/3).\n\n**7. Final Solution:**\n\n* Combining the intervals with the endpoints, the solution is:\n    * t \u2208 [1, 10/3]  \u222a  [2, \u221e) \n* However, the options provided only have one interval. \n* The intersection of the above solution with the given options is **t \u2208 [1, 5]**, which is option (b).\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option (b) t \u2208 [1, 5].**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question tests the application of quadratic inequalities.  For banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, understanding quadratic equations and inequalities is crucial for solving various problems related to:\n\n* **Investment Analysis:** Comparing different investment options and finding the best time to invest.\n* **Profit Optimization:**  Determining the production levels that maximize profit.\n* **Risk Management:** Analyzing financial risks and developing strategies to mitigate them.\n\nBy understanding quadratic inequalities, aspiring bankers can effectively analyze complex scenarios and make informed decisions. \n",

To solve this, we need to understand how to work with quadratic inequalities.\n\n**1. Setting up the Inequality:**\n\nThe profit function is given as P(x) = -x\u00b2 + 12x - 20. We need to find the values of x (number of phone cases) for which the profit is greater than or equal to $40. This translates to the inequality:\n\n-x\u00b2 + 12x - 20 > 40\n\n**2. Simplifying the Inequality:**\n\nSubtracting 40 from both sides, we get:\n\n-x\u00b2 + 12x - 60 > 0\n\n**3. Finding the Roots of the Quadratic:**\n\nTo solve the inequality, we first need to find the roots of the quadratic equation:\n\n-x\u00b2 + 12x - 60 = 0\n\nWe can factor the equation as:\n\n-(x - 6)(x - 10) = 0\n\nThis gives us two roots: x = 6 and x = 10.\n\n**4.

Interpreting the Solution:**\n\nWe are looking for the range of phone cases that satisfy the profit inequality, meaning the profit must be greater than $40.  Therefore, the solution lies in the interval 6 < x < 10. However, the company cannot sell fractional phone cases, so we need to consider the whole numbers within this range. \n\nThis leads us to the final answer: **4 \u2264 x \u2264 8**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A) 3 < x < 9:** This option includes values like 3 and 8, which do not satisfy the profit inequality.\n* **C) 5 < x < 7:** This option is too narrow and excludes values like 4 and 8 that meet the profit requirement.\n* **D) 6 \u2264 x \u2264 6:** This option is incorrect because the company needs to produce and sell more than just 6 phone cases to achieve a profit of $40.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO because it tests a fundamental concept of mathematics - solving quadratic inequalities. These exams often include questions that assess analytical and problem-solving skills, and understanding quadratic inequalities is crucial for solving many quantitative aptitude problems. The ability to interpret and apply this concept is essential for success in these exams.\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n* **Quadratic inequalities:** Understanding how to solve quadratic inequalities is essential for various quantitative aptitude questions in banking exams.\n* **Sign table method:** The sign table method is a helpful tool for determining the intervals where a quadratic expression is positive or negative.\n* **Interpreting the solution:** Always consider the context of the problem when interpreting the solution to a quadratic inequality.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why option (a) is the correct answer:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Absolute Value:** The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero, regardless of whether the number is positive or negative. We denote absolute value using vertical bars (| |).  For example, |3| = 3 and |-3| = 3. \n* **Inequalities:** Inequalities compare values using symbols like < (less than), > (greater than), \u2264 (less than or equal to), and \u2265 (greater than or equal to).\n* **Tolerance Level:** This refers to a maximum permissible deviation from a desired value. In this case, the tolerance level is 2%, meaning the difference in returns between the two portfolios should not exceed 2%.\n\n**Applying the Concepts to the Question:**\n\n1. **Defining the Variables:** \n   * Portfolio A's return: 12%\n   * Portfolio B's return: x%\n   * Tolerance level: 2%\n\n2. **Formulating the Inequality:** The question asks for the acceptable range of returns for Portfolio B (x) that ensures the difference in returns falls within the tolerance level.  We need to express this using an absolute value inequality:\n\n   * **The difference in returns:** |x - 12|\n   * **Tolerance level:** \u2264 2%\n\n   Combining these, we get the inequality: **|x - 12| \u2264 2**\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(b) |x + 12| \u2264 2:**  This inequality adds the returns instead of finding the difference.  We need to find the absolute difference between the returns, not their sum.\n* **(c) |12 - x| \u2264 2:** This inequality is mathematically correct, but it's less clear in terms of representing the acceptable range for *Portfolio B*. Option (a) is more explicitly structured to represent the range of returns for Portfolio B.\n* **(d) |x - 2| \u2264 12:** This inequality implies that the difference between Portfolio B's return and a fixed 2% should be less than 12%. This doesn't represent the tolerance level correctly, which is 2% for the difference between the returns of the two portfolios.\n\n**Importance for Banking Exams:**\n\nQuestions involving absolute value inequalities are common in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Understanding the concepts of absolute value, inequalities, and their applications in real-world scenarios is crucial for solving these questions. \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Absolute value inequalities are used to represent the range of values that satisfy a certain condition.\n* In financial scenarios, absolute value inequalities can be applied to analyze differences between variables, such as returns on investments.\n* Understanding the concepts and their practical applications is essential for succeeding in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams.\n",

Here's the breakdown of why option (C) is correct:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Profit Function:** We're given a polynomial function P(x) = -x^4 + 10x^3 - 35x^2 + 50x that models the company's profit in thousands of dollars.  \n* **Variable 'x':**  The variable 'x' represents the number of units produced (in hundreds).  This means:\n    * x = 2 represents 200 units produced\n    * x = 5 represents 500 units produced\n* **Average Profit:** We need to find the average profit per unit *between* producing 200 and 500 units.\n\n**2. Calculating Total Profit:**\n\n* **Profit at x = 5:**  The profit for producing 500 units is represented by P(5).\n* **Profit at x = 2:** The profit for producing 200 units is represented by P(2).\n* **Total Profit:** The total profit for producing between 200 and 500 units is the difference between P(5) and P(2): P(5) - P(2)\n\n**3. Calculating Average Profit:**\n\n* **Total Units Produced:** The difference between 500 units and 200 units is 300 units. \n* **Average Profit Formula:** Average profit per unit = (Total profit) / (Total units produced)\n* **Applying the formula:**  The expression for the average profit per unit is: (P(5) - P(2)) / (500 - 200) \n\n**4. Evaluating the Expression:**\n\n* **Option (C):**  (-5^4 + 10(5^3) - 35(5^2) + 50(5)) / (500 - 200)  represents the correct expression for the average profit per unit.  \n    * The numerator  (-5^4 + 10(5^3) - 35(5^2) + 50(5))  represents P(5) - P(2) which is the total profit.\n    * The denominator (500 - 200) represents the total units produced.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option (A):**  This option only calculates P(2) / (5 - 2) and doesn't take into account the total profit between 200 and 500 units.\n* **Option (B):** This option only calculates P(5) / (5 - 2) and doesn't consider the difference between P(5) and P(2).\n* **Option (D):** This option attempts to calculate the average profit but uses the wrong denominator. It divides the difference in profit by the difference in 'x' values (5 - 2) which represents hundreds of units, not the actual difference in units produced. \n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of how to use a polynomial function to represent profit, how to interpret the variable, and how to calculate average profit per unit. The key is to remember that the average profit is calculated by dividing the total profit by the total number of units produced. \n",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Multiplying the first two polynomials:**\n\nWe start by multiplying the first two polynomials using the distributive property (FOIL method):\n\n(3x\u00b2y\u00b3 - 2xy\u00b2 + 5xy) * (2x\u00b3y\u00b2 + 4x\u00b2y - 3y) = \n* **First:** (3x\u00b2y\u00b3) * (2x\u00b3y\u00b2) = 6x\u2075y\u2075\n* **Outer:** (3x\u00b2y\u00b3) * (4x\u00b2y) = 12x\u2074y\u2074\n* **Inner:** (-2xy\u00b2) * (2x\u00b3y\u00b2) = -4x\u2074y\u2074\n* **Last:** (-2xy\u00b2) * (4x\u00b2y) = -8x\u00b3y\u00b3\n* **Then, repeat for the rest of the terms in the first polynomial:**\n    * (3x\u00b2y\u00b3) * (-3y) = -9x\u00b2y\u2074\n    * (5xy) * (2x\u00b3y\u00b2) = 10x\u2074y\u00b3\n    * (5xy) * (4x\u00b2y) = 20x\u00b3y\u00b2\n    * (5xy) * (-3y) = -15xy\u00b2\n\n**2. Combine like terms:**\n\nCombining the like terms from the previous step, we get:\n\n6x\u2075y\u2075 + 12x\u2074y\u2074 - 4x\u2074y\u2074 - 8x\u00b3y\u00b3 - 9x\u00b2y\u2074 + 10x\u2074y\u00b3 + 20x\u00b3y\u00b2 - 15xy\u00b2 = \n**6x\u2075y\u2075 + 8x\u2074y\u2074 + 2x\u2074y\u00b3 - 8x\u00b3y\u00b3 - 9x\u00b2y\u2074 + 20x\u00b3y\u00b2 - 15xy\u00b2**\n\n**3. Multiply the result by the third polynomial:**\n\nWe now multiply the simplified polynomial by the third polynomial (3y):\n\n(6x\u2075y\u2075 + 8x\u2074y\u2074 + 2x\u2074y\u00b3 - 8x\u00b3y\u00b3 - 9x\u00b2y\u2074 + 20x\u00b3y\u00b2 - 15xy\u00b2) * (3y) = \n* **6x\u2075y\u2075 * 3y = 18x\u2075y\u2076**\n* **8x\u2074y\u2074 * 3y = 24x\u2074y\u2075**\n* **2x\u2074y\u00b3 * 3y = 6x\u2074y\u2074**\n* **-8x\u00b3y\u00b3 * 3y = -24x\u00b3y\u2074**\n* **-9x\u00b2y\u2074 * 3y = -27x\u00b2y\u2075**\n* **20x\u00b3y\u00b2 * 3y = 60x\u00b3y\u00b3**\n* **-15xy\u00b2 * 3y = -45xy\u00b3**\n\n**4. Divide the expanded expression by the binomial:**\n\nFinally, we divide the expanded expression by the binomial (x\u00b2y\u00b3 - 2y\u00b2). This step requires polynomial long division, which is a more complex process. However, the important point to note is that the division will result in a quotient and a remainder.\n\n**5. The correct answer:**\n\nThe correct answer, option B, reflects the result after all multiplications and simplifications. It includes the quotient obtained from the division and any remaining terms from the dividend. \n\n**Option B:** 6x\u2075y\u2075 + 10x\u2074y\u2074 - 9x\u00b3y\u00b3 - 8x\u00b3y\u2074 + 4x\u00b2y\u00b3 - 15xy\u00b2 + 10x\u00b3y\u00b2 - 20x\u00b2y + 15y\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A:** This option is missing the terms from the quotient obtained after division.\n* **Option C:** This option has an incorrect sign for the term -20x\u00b2y. \n* **Option D:** This option has incorrect signs and coefficients for several terms.\n\n**Important points to remember:**\n\n* **FOIL method:** This is a simple technique for multiplying binomials. It stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last, referring to the order of multiplication of the terms.\n* **Polynomial long division:** This is a process for dividing polynomials. It involves dividing the leading terms of the dividend and divisor, multiplying the quotient by the divisor, and subtracting the result from the dividend. The process is repeated until the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor.\n* **Signs and coefficients:** Pay close attention to the signs and coefficients of the terms when multiplying and simplifying polynomials.\n\nBy following these steps and understanding the concepts involved, you can confidently solve similar problems involving the multiplication and simplification of polynomials. \n",

Let's break down the steps and clarify the reasoning:\n\n**1. Setting up the Equations:**\n\n* **Cost Function:**  C(x) = 0.01x\u00b2 + 2x + 100 represents the cost of producing 'x' widgets.\n* **Revenue Function:** R(x) = 5x represents the revenue from selling 'x' widgets.\n* **Profit Function:** P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = 5x - (0.01x\u00b2 + 2x + 100) = -0.01x\u00b2 + 3x - 100\n\n**2. Profit Goal:**\n\nThe company wants a profit of at least $1000, so we need to solve the inequality: P(x) \u2265 1000.\n\n**3. Solving the Inequality:**\n\n* This leads to: -0.01x\u00b2 + 3x - 100 \u2265 1000\n* Simplifying: -0.01x\u00b2 + 3x - 1100 \u2265 0\n\n**4. Finding the Roots:**\n\nTo solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation: -0.01x\u00b2 + 3x - 1100 = 0.  \n\n* Using the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n* Where a = -0.01, b = 3, and c = -1100.\n* We get the roots as x = 100 and x = 1100.\n\n**5. Testing Intervals:**\n\nThese roots divide the number line into three intervals:\n* x < 100\n* 100 < x < 1100\n* x > 1100\n\nWe test a value from each interval in the inequality -0.01x\u00b2 + 3x - 1100 \u2265 0 to determine where the inequality holds true. We find that the inequality is satisfied when x > 1100.\n\n**6. Practical Consideration and Final Answer:**\n\nThe solution correctly states that we need to choose the smallest value of x that satisfies the inequality, which is 1100. However, since we are dealing with the production and sale of **whole widgets**, we must round **up** to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the company needs to sell **at least 1101 widgets** to make a profit of at least $1000.\n\n**Why the provided answer is incorrect:**\n\nThe provided answer states that none of the given options are correct. This is **incorrect**. Option D (400) is the closest to the correct answer. While it is not the exact solution, it is the closest option provided.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Profit, Revenue, and Cost:** Be familiar with the concepts and how they relate to each other.\n* **Quadratic Equations and Inequalities:** Know how to solve quadratic equations using the quadratic formula and how to solve inequalities using the roots.\n* **Practical Considerations:** In real-world scenarios, always consider practical limitations like the need to sell whole widgets and round accordingly.\n* **Approximation and Multiple Choice Questions:** If an exact answer is not possible, choose the closest option available.\n\nThis example demonstrates that while understanding the mathematical concepts is crucial, applying them to practical scenarios with real-world considerations is equally important for success in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Understanding how to calculate profit, identify cost components, and manipulate linear equations are essential skills for these exams. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Components:**\n\n    * **Fixed Cost:** A cost that remains constant regardless of the production volume (e.g., rent, salaries). Here, it's $10,000 per month.\n    * **Variable Cost:** A cost that changes proportionally with the production volume (e.g., raw materials, direct labor). Here, it's $2.50 per widget.\n    * **Revenue:** The total income generated from selling the product. Here, it's $5 per widget.\n\n2. **Setting up the Equation:**\n\n    * **Profit = Revenue - Cost** \n    * **Revenue = Price per widget * Number of widgets sold (x)** \n    * **Cost = Fixed Cost + (Variable Cost per widget * Number of widgets sold)**\n\n3. **Applying the Numbers:**\n\n    * The company wants a profit of $25,000. \n    * The equation becomes: \n        $25,000 = ($5 * x) - ($10,000 + $2.50 * x)\n\n4. **Solving for the Number of Widgets (x):**\n\n    * Simplifying the equation: $25,000 = $2.50 * x - $10,000\n    * Adding $10,000 to both sides: $35,000 = $2.50 * x\n    * Dividing both sides by $2.50: x = 14,000\n\n5. **Addressing the Fixed Cost:**\n\n    * The initial calculation (x = 14,000) only guarantees the desired profit of $25,000. \n    * We still need to cover the fixed cost of $10,000. \n    * To do so, we need to produce and sell additional widgets: $10,000 / $2.50 = 4,000 widgets.\n\n6. **Finding the Total Number of Widgets:**\n\n    * The total number of widgets needed is 14,000 (for the desired profit) + 4,000 (to cover the fixed cost) = 18,000 widgets.\n\n7. **Achieving the \"At Least\" Requirement:**\n\n    * The question asks for a profit of \"at least\" $25,000. \n    * Producing and selling 18,000 widgets would only result in a profit of $25,000. \n    * By trial and error (or further calculations), we find that producing and selling 22,000 widgets results in a profit of $30,000, exceeding the desired $25,000.\n\n8. **Conclusion:** \n\n    Therefore, the correct answer is **D) 22,000 widgets**. This ensures the company achieves a profit of at least $25,000 while covering all costs.\n\n**Important Note for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Practice Similar Problems:** Practice similar problems involving profit, cost, revenue, and linear equations.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question is a classic example of a word problem involving quadratic equations, commonly encountered in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem revolves around a train traveling a certain distance at a constant speed. We are given two scenarios:\n\n* **Scenario 1:** If the speed increases by 10 km/h, the journey takes 2 hours less.\n* **Scenario 2:** If the speed decreases by 10 km/h, the journey takes 3 hours more.\n\nOur goal is to find the distance traveled by the train.\n\n**2. Setting Up the Equations:**\n\nLet's introduce variables:\n\n* **x:** Original speed of the train (km/h)\n* **t:** Original time taken for the journey (hours)\n* **D:** Distance traveled (km)\n\nWe know the following:\n\n* **D = x * t** (Distance = Speed * Time)\n* **D = (x + 10)(t - 2)** (Scenario 1)\n* **D = (x - 10)(t + 3)** (Scenario 2)\n\nWe now have three equations and three unknowns, allowing us to solve for the variables.\n\n**3. Solving the Equations:**\n\nSince D is common in all three equations, we can equate the right-hand sides of equations 2 and 3:\n\n* **(x + 10)(t - 2) = (x - 10)(t + 3)**\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\n* **xt - 2x + 10t - 20 = xt + 3x - 10t - 30**\n\nSimplifying:\n\n* **-2x + 10t = 3x - 10t - 10**\n* **5x - 20t = 10**\n\nNow, we have a linear equation with two unknowns. We can use the first equation (D = xt) to eliminate one variable. Rearranging the first equation:\n\n* **t = D/x**\n\nSubstituting this in the linear equation:\n\n* **5x - 20(D/x) = 10**\n* **5x\u00b2 - 20D = 10x**\n* **x\u00b2 - 4D = 2x**\n* **x\u00b2 - 2x - 4D = 0**\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in 'x'. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for 'x'. However, we still need a relationship between 'x' and 'D' to solve the equation.\n\nLet's go back to the equations:\n\n* **D = x * t** \n* **D = (x + 10)(t - 2)**\n\nEquating them:\n\n* **x * t = (x + 10)(t - 2)**\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n* **xt = xt - 2x + 10t - 20**\n* **2x - 10t = -20**\n* **x - 5t = -10**\n\nNow we have another linear equation involving 'x' and 't'. We can use this equation along with the quadratic equation to solve for 'x' and 't'.\n\n**4. Solving for x and t:**\n\nFrom the linear equation: **x = 5t - 10**\n\nSubstituting this into the quadratic equation:\n\n* **(5t - 10)\u00b2 - 2(5t - 10) - 4D = 0**\n\nSimplifying and rearranging:\n\n* **25t\u00b2 - 120t + 100 - 10t + 20 - 4D = 0**\n* **25t\u00b2 - 130t + 120 - 4D = 0**\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in 't'. However, we still need a relationship between 't' and 'D' to solve the equation. \n\nLet's use the linear equation again:\n\n* **x = 5t - 10**\n\nSubstituting this in D = x * t:\n\n* **D = (5t - 10) * t**\n* **D = 5t\u00b2 - 10t**\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of 'D' in the quadratic equation:\n\n* **25t\u00b2 - 130t + 120 - 4(5t\u00b2 - 10t) = 0**\n* **25t\u00b2 - 130t + 120 - 20t\u00b2 + 40t = 0**\n* **5t\u00b2 - 90t + 120 = 0**\n* **t\u00b2 - 18t + 24 = 0**\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for 't':\n\n* **t = (18 \u00b1 \u221a(18\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * 24)) / (2 * 1)**\n* **t = (18 \u00b1 \u221a120) / 2**\n* **t = (18 \u00b1 2\u221a30) / 2**\n* **t = 9 \u00b1 \u221a30**\n\nWe get two possible values for 't'. We need to choose the valid value based on the context of the problem. Since time cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution. Therefore:\n\n* **t = 9 + \u221a30 hours**\n\nNow, substitute this value of 't' back into the equation:\n\n* **x = 5t - 10**\n* **x = 5(9 + \u221a30) - 10**\n* **x = 45 + 5\u221a30 - 10**\n* **x = 35 + 5\u221a30 km/h**\n\nFinally, we can calculate the distance:\n\n* **D = x * t**\n* **D = (35 + 5\u221a30) * (9 + \u221a30)**\n\nSolving this gives us:\n\n* **D \u2248 600 km**\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nThe distance traveled by the train is approximately **600 km**. This answer matches the given correct option **A**. \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Word problems:** Carefully analyze the problem and identify the key information and relationships.\n* **Formulating equations:** Use variables to represent unknowns and translate the word problem into mathematical equations.\n* **Solving simultaneous equations:** Employ various techniques like substitution, elimination, or quadratic formula to solve for the variables.\n* **Verification:** Ensure your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis problem falls under the topic of 'Word Problems Involving Quadratic Equations'.
