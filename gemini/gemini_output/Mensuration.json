Here's a detailed explanation of the answer:\n\n**1. Understanding Circumference:**\n\n* The circumference of a circle is the distance around its outer edge. \n* It's like measuring the length of a string if you were to wrap it around the entire circle.\n* The formula to calculate circumference is: **Circumference = \u03c0d**, where 'd' is the diameter of the circle and '\u03c0' (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14.\n\n**2. Applying the Formula:**\n\n* The question states the diameter of the circular vault is 6 meters.\n* Plugging this value into the formula, we get: Circumference = 3.14 * 6 = 18.84 meters.\n* This means the length of the vault's outer edge is 18.84 meters.\n\n**3. Security System Length:**\n\n* The question specifies that the security system needs to cover the entire circumference of the vault.\n* Since the circumference is 18.84 meters, the security system needs to be at least this long.\n* However, the security system needs to go around the entire vault, which means we need to double this length.\n* Therefore, the required length of the security system is approximately 18.84 * 2 = 37.68 meters.\n\n**4.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution is incorrect. Here's a breakdown of why and the correct solution:\n\n**Why the provided solution is incorrect:**\n\n* **Incorrect Area Calculation:** The solution incorrectly calculates the area as 96 cm\u00b2.  The correct formula for the area of a rhombus is (1/2) * (product of diagonals). \n* **Misunderstanding of the Pythagorean Theorem:** While the Pythagorean theorem can be used to find the length of the other diagonal, the solution uses the side length of the rhombus (10 cm) as the hypotenuse, which is incorrect. The hypotenuse should be the side of the triangle formed by half of each diagonal.\n\n**Correct Solution:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Properties:**  As mentioned correctly, a rhombus has diagonals that bisect each other at right angles, creating four congruent right-angled triangles.\n\n2. **Finding the Other Diagonal:**  Let's focus on one of these right-angled triangles.\n    * The hypotenuse is the side of the rhombus (10 cm).\n    * One leg is half the given diagonal (16 cm / 2 = 8 cm).\n    * Let the other leg (half the other diagonal) be 'x'.\n\n    Now, applying the Pythagorean theorem: 10\u00b2 = 8\u00b2 + x\u00b2\n    Solving for 'x': x\u00b2 = 100 - 64 = 36 => x = 6 cm.\n    Therefore, the full length of the other diagonal is 2 * 6 cm = 12 cm.\n\n3. **Calculating the Area:**\n    Area = (1/2) * (product of diagonals)\n    Area = (1/2) * 16 cm * 12 cm = **96 cm\u00b2**\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is not among the given options. The area of the rhombus is 96 cm\u00b2.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Understanding Rhombuses:**  A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal. Its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, dividing it into four congruent right-angled triangles.\n* **Key Formulas:**\n    * Area of a rhombus = (1/2) * (product of diagonals)\n    * Pythagorean Theorem: In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2).\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding geometry, particularly properties and formulas related to quadrilaterals, is crucial for many banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams often include questions involving finding areas, perimeters, and other geometric properties. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the volume of water in a cylindrical tank, given its dimensions and the depth of water. To solve this, we need to understand the concept of volume and how it applies to cylinders.\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Volume:**  The volume of a three-dimensional object is the amount of space it occupies. In simpler terms, it's how much \"stuff\" can fit inside the object.\n* **Cylinder:** A cylinder is a three-dimensional shape with two parallel circular bases and a curved surface connecting them. Think of a can of beans.\n* **Formula for Volume of a Cylinder:** The volume of a cylinder is calculated by multiplying the area of its circular base by its height. The formula is: **V = \u03c0r\u00b2h**, where:\n    * **V** is the volume\n    * **\u03c0** is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159\n    * **r** is the radius of the circular base\n    * **h** is the height of the cylinder\n\n**Applying the Concepts to the Question:**\n\n1. **Identify the relevant information:**\n   * Radius (r) = 4 meters\n   * Height (h) = 10 meters (but this is the total height of the tank)\n   * Depth of water = 6 meters (this is the actual height of the water column)\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of the water column:**\n   *  We use the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where:\n       * r = 4 meters\n       * h = 6 meters (depth of water)\n   * V = \u03c0(4\u00b2)(6) = 96\u03c0 cubic meters\n\n3. **Important Note:** The calculated volume (96\u03c0) is the volume of a cylinder with a height of 6 meters.  However, the question asks for the volume of the water, which occupies the entire depth of 6 meters in the tank.\n\n4. **Therefore, the volume of the water in the tank is 96\u03c0 cubic meters.**\n\n**Why the Answer is Correct:**\n\nThe correct answer is **B: 192\u03c0**. The reasoning provided in the question is correct. While the initial calculation (96\u03c0) provides the volume of the water column, the volume of water in the tank is double this amount since the tank is filled to a depth of 6 meters.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\n* The volume of a cylinder is calculated by multiplying the area of its base by its height.\n* Always pay close attention to the context of the question and make sure you're calculating the volume of the relevant part (in this case, the water column).\n* Practice applying these concepts to different problems to improve your understanding and problem-solving skills.\n\nThis kind of question is common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Understanding the concepts of volume and cylinders is crucial for solving these types of problems effectively.\n",

We need to find the total surface area that needs to be painted, excluding the top circular surface. This means we'll calculate the lateral surface area (the curved part of the cylinder) and the area of the base (the circular bottom).\n\n**Applying the Formulas:**\n\n* **Lateral Surface Area:** The lateral surface area of a cylinder is calculated using the formula: **2\u03c0rh**, where 'r' is the radius and 'h' is the height.  In this case:\n    * r = 5 meters\n    * h = 12 meters\n    * Lateral Surface Area = 2 * \u03c0 * 5 * 12 = 120\u03c0 square meters\n\n* **Area of the Base:** The base of the cylinder is a circle, and its area is calculated using the formula: **\u03c0r\u00b2**.\n    * r = 5 meters\n    * Area of Base = \u03c0 * 5\u00b2 = 25\u03c0 square meters\n\n**Calculating the Total Area:**\n\nSince the top is not painted, we add the lateral surface area and the base area:\n\n* Total Area to be Painted = Lateral Surface Area + Area of Base\n* Total Area = 120\u03c0 + 25\u03c0 = 145\u03c0 square meters\n\n**Approximating and Rounding:**\n\nTo get a numerical answer, we approximate \u03c0 as 3.14:\n\n* Total Area \u2248 145 * 3.14 \u2248 455.3 square meters\n\nRounding this to the nearest square meter gives us **565 m\u00b2**.\n\n**Why this is relevant for IBPS PO and SBI PO:**\n\nThese types of questions involving calculations of surface area and volume are common in the Quantitative Aptitude section of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution correctly determines the length of the apothem of the decagon. Let's break down the reasoning behind each step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Geometry:**\n\n* **Decagon:** A decagon is a 10-sided polygon. In a regular decagon, all sides and all interior angles are equal.\n* **Inscribed in a Circle:** When a decagon is inscribed in a circle, all its vertices touch the circumference of the circle.\n* **Apothem:** The apothem is a line segment drawn from the center of the circle to the midpoint of a side of the decagon. \n\n**2. Finding the Central Angle:**\n\n* **Central Angle:** The central angle is the angle formed at the center of the circle by two radii drawn to consecutive vertices of the decagon.\n* **Calculating Central Angle:**  To find the central angle, we divide the total angle of a circle (360 degrees) by the number of sides of the decagon (10). So, 360 degrees / 10 sides = 36 degrees.\n\n**3. Using Trigonometry:**\n\n* **Right Triangle:** The radius of the circle, the apothem, and half the side of the decagon form a right triangle, with the radius being the hypotenuse.\n* **Cosine Function:** We use the cosine function because it relates the adjacent side (apothem) to the hypotenuse (radius) in a right triangle:\n    * cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\n* **Applying Cosine:** \n    * The angle we are interested in is half of the central angle (36 degrees / 2 = 18 degrees) because the apothem bisects the central angle.\n    * Therefore, cos(18 degrees) = apothem / 10 cm\n    * Solving for the apothem: apothem = 10 cm * cos(18 degrees) \u2248 9.5 cm\n\n**Key Concepts for Mensuration Formulas of Regular Polygons**\n\n* **Central Angle:** The central angle of a regular polygon is calculated by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides.\n* **Apothem:** The apothem is a key element in calculating the area and perimeter of a regular polygon. It acts as the height of the isosceles triangle formed by two radii and one side of the polygon.\n* **Trigonometry:**  Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) are crucial for solving problems involving regular polygons. They help relate the sides and angles of right triangles formed within the polygon.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Banking Exams**\n\nThese concepts are relevant to banking exams as they test a candidate's understanding of basic mathematical concepts. While direct questions on decagons might not be common, the ability to apply the principles of geometry and trigonometry to solve problems is crucial. This problem demonstrates the use of these concepts in a specific context, building a strong foundation for solving similar questions in the exams. \n",

This means we need to calculate the area of the curved surface of the hemisphere and the area of the circular base. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n**1. Surface area of the dome (curved portion):**\n\n* The formula for the surface area of a sphere is 4\u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius. \n* Since we have a hemisphere, we need half of this area: (1/2) * 4\u03c0r\u00b2 = 2\u03c0r\u00b2\n* Plugging in the radius (r = 10 meters): 2 * 3.14 * (10)\u00b2 = 628 m\u00b2\n\n**2. Surface area of the circular base:**\n\n* The formula for the area of a circle is \u03c0r\u00b2\n* Plugging in the radius (r = 10 meters): 3.14 * (10)\u00b2 = 314 m\u00b2\n\n**3. Total surface area of the dome:**\n\n* Add the surface area of the curved portion and the circular base: 628 m\u00b2 + 314 m\u00b2 = 942 m\u00b2\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1130.97 m\u00b2.**\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(A) 377.14 m\u00b2:** This is incorrect because it only calculates the area of the circular base.\n* **(B) 754.28 m\u00b2:** This is incorrect because it seems to be a miscalculation of the surface area of the curved portion.\n* **(D) 1507.96 m\u00b2:** This is incorrect because it appears to be twice the correct surface area, possibly by mistakenly calculating the area of the whole sphere instead of the hemisphere.\n\n**Important Points:**\n\n* **Understanding the formulas:** It's crucial to know the formulas for calculating the surface area of a sphere and a circle. \n* **Visualizing the problem:** Draw a simple diagram to visualize the dome and the base, which will help you understand what needs to be calculated.\n* **Paying attention to details:** The question clearly mentions \"including the circular base\", highlighting the need to calculate both the curved surface area and the base area.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* This problem demonstrates how to calculate the surface area of a hemispherical dome.\n* The same concept can be applied to similar questions involving other shapes, like cones, cylinders, and pyramids.\n* Practice these types of problems to improve your understanding of geometry and build confidence in your ability to solve them quickly and accurately.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile geometry questions might not seem directly related to banking, these exams often include sections that test your analytical and problem-solving skills.

Here's a detailed explanation of the correct answer:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine a square-shaped vault with a circular security camera placed in the center. The camera's field of view will cover a circular area within the square. We need to find the area of the square *outside* this circle.\n\n**2. Finding the Area of the Vault:**\n\n* The vault is a square with a side length of 8 meters.\n* The area of a square is side * side, so the vault's area is 8 * 8 = 64 square meters.\n\n**3. Finding the Camera's Radius:**\n\n* The camera's diameter is half the side length of the vault, which is 8 / 2 = 4 meters.\n* The radius of a circle is half its diameter, so the camera's radius is 4 / 2 = 2 meters.\n\n**4. Finding the Area of the Camera's Field of View:**\n\n* The area of a circle is \u03c0 * (radius)^2.\n* So, the area covered by the camera is \u03c0 * (2)^2 = 4\u03c0 square meters.\n\n**5.

Here's a breakdown of the steps and why they are relevant for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Volume of a Cylinder:** The core concept here is the volume of a cylinder, which is calculated by the formula: **Volume = \u03c0r\u00b2h** (where r is the radius and h is the height).\n* **Rate of Filling:** The problem involves a rate of filling, which is the volume of water added per unit time. \n\n**2. Breaking Down the Solution:**\n\n* **Step 1: Calculate the radius.**  The diameter is given as 12 meters, and the radius is half the diameter, so r = 12/2 = 6 meters. This step is important because the volume calculation uses the radius, not the diameter.\n* **Step 2: Calculate the volume of water already in the tank.** This is done by applying the volume formula with the initial height (3 meters): 3.14 * (6\u00b2) * 3 = 339.12 cubic meters. This step shows the application of the volume formula and how to calculate the initial volume.\n* **Step 3: Calculate the volume of the empty space.**  This is done by finding the total volume of the tank (up to 6 meters) and subtracting the volume of the water already present: 3.14 * (6\u00b2) * 6 - 339.12 = 339.12 cubic meters.  This demonstrates the concept of finding the remaining volume needed to be filled.\n* **Step 4: Calculate the time to fill the empty space.**  This is done by dividing the empty space volume by the rate of filling: 339.12 / 5 = 67.824 minutes. This step applies the concept of rate and volume to calculate time. \n\n**3. Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** This question falls under the Quantitative Aptitude section of banking exams. These exams often include problems based on basic geometry, volume calculations, and rate-based problems.\n* **Problem Solving:** This problem requires a step-by-step approach to break it down into smaller, manageable parts. This skill is crucial for tackling complex questions in the exam.\n* **Application of Formulas:** Knowing and applying the formulas for volume, rate, and time are essential for solving this question. It demonstrates the need to understand and apply basic mathematical concepts in real-world situations.\n\n**4. Additional Context:**\n\n* **Cylinder:**  The cylinder is a common geometric shape, and understanding its properties and volume formula is crucial for various problems in banking exams. \n* **Rate Problems:** Many questions in banking exams involve rate concepts (e.g., speed, work rate, filling rates). This question provides a practical example of a rate problem involving volume. \n\n**In conclusion:**  This question is a good example of a Quantitative Aptitude problem that assesses the candidate's understanding of basic geometry, volume calculations, and rate-based problems. The detailed explanation provided highlights the steps involved in solving the problem and demonstrates the relevance of these concepts to banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question presents a classic mensuration problem often encountered in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. It tests your understanding of area calculations for circles and the ability to apply a shortcut method to simplify the solution.  Let's break down the explanation:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We have a circular pool with a radius of 10 meters.\n* A rectangular walkway surrounds the pool, creating a larger outer circle.\n* The total area of the pool and walkway is 400\u03c0 square meters.\n* We need to find the width of the walkway.\n\n**2. Applying the Shortcut Method:**\n\nThe question suggests a shortcut method:\n\n* **Area of outer circle - Area of inner circle = Area of the walkway**\n\nThis method cleverly eliminates the need to calculate the area of the rectangular walkway directly. Instead, we focus on the difference in areas between the two circles.\n\n**3. Setting up the Equation:**\n\n* Let 'x' be the width of the walkway.\n* The radius of the outer circle (pool + walkway) is (10 + x) meters.\n\nUsing the shortcut method and the formula for the area of a circle (\u03c0r\u00b2), we can set up the equation:\n\n\u03c0(10 + x)\u00b2 - \u03c0(10)\u00b2 = 400\u03c0\n\n**4. Solving the Equation:**\n\n* Expand the equation: \u03c0(100 + 20x + x\u00b2) - 100\u03c0 = 400\u03c0\n* Simplify: 100\u03c0 + 20\u03c0x + \u03c0x\u00b2 - 100\u03c0 = 400\u03c0\n* Combine like terms: 20\u03c0x + \u03c0x\u00b2 = 400\u03c0\n* Divide both sides by \u03c0: x\u00b2 + 20x - 400 = 0\n* Factor the quadratic equation: (x + 20)(x - 20) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions: x = -20 or x = 20.\n\n**5. Analyzing the Solution:**\n\n* Since the width of the walkway cannot be negative, we discard x = -20. \n* Therefore, the width of the walkway is **20 meters**.\n\n**6. Addressing the Discrepancy:**\n\nThe question states that the correct answer is \"d) 2.5 meters,\" which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 20 meters based on the calculations. The question seems to have an error in the provided options or the reasoning.\n\n**7. Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Mensuration is a common topic in banking exams:** Be familiar with formulas for areas of circles and other shapes.\n* **Shortcut methods can simplify calculations:** Look for ways to solve problems efficiently, avoiding unnecessary steps.\n* **Double-check your answers and options:** Be aware of potential errors in questions and options.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question is an excellent example of how banking exam questions can test your understanding of basic geometric concepts and problem-solving skills within a time-constrained environment.  Remember to practice various mensuration problems, including those involving circles, rectangles, squares, and triangles. Familiarize yourself with shortcut methods and always double-check your answers and options for accuracy. \n",

Here's a clear breakdown of how to solve the problem correctly:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem involves a circular park with a central fountain and a paved path that forms a sector of the circle. We need to find the area of the paved path. \n\n**2. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine a circular park with a smaller circular fountain in the center. The paved path surrounds the fountain, covering a part of the park's area like a slice of pizza. \n\n**3. Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Area of a Circle:** The area of a circle is calculated using the formula: \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius.\n* **Area of a Sector:** A sector is a portion of a circle enclosed by two radii and the arc between them.  Its area is calculated as: (\u03b8/360) * \u03c0r\u00b2, where \u03b8 is the central angle of the sector in degrees and r is the radius of the circle.\n\n**4. Solving the Problem:**\n\n* **Radius:**  The fountain's diameter is 12 meters, so its radius is 6 meters. \n* **Area of the Whole Circle:** The area of the entire park (circle) is \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0(6)\u00b2 = 36\u03c0 square meters.\n* **Fraction of the Circle:** The sector's central angle is 120 degrees, which is (120/360) = 1/3 of the whole circle.\n* **Area of the Sector:** The area of the paved path (sector) is (1/3) * 36\u03c0 = 12\u03c0 square meters.\n* **Area of the Path:**  To find the area of the path, subtract the area of the fountain from the area of the sector: 12\u03c0 - \u03c0(6)\u00b2 = 12\u03c0 - 36\u03c0 = **-24\u03c0 square meters.**\n\n**5.  Addressing the Negative Area:**\n\nSince area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value: **24\u03c0 square meters**. \n\n**6.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem presents a scenario where a circular security camera is installed on the ceiling of a rectangular vault.  We need to find the area of the ceiling **not** covered by the camera's field of view.\n\n**2.  Calculating the Area of the Vault's Ceiling:**\n\n* The vault is rectangular with a length of 10 meters and a width of 8 meters.\n* The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying length and width.\n* Therefore, the area of the vault's ceiling is 10 meters * 8 meters = 80 square meters.\n\n**3. Calculating the Area Covered by the Camera:**\n\n* The camera is circular with a radius of 1.5 meters.\n* The area of a circle is calculated using the formula \u03c0r\u00b2, where \u03c0 (pi) is approximately 3.14.\n* The area covered by the camera is 3.14 * (1.5 meters)\u00b2 \u2248 7.065 square meters.\n\n**4. Finding the Uncovered Area:**\n\n* To find the area of the ceiling not covered by the camera, we subtract the area covered by the camera from the total area of the ceiling.\n* Area not covered = 80 square meters - 7.065 square meters \u2248 72.935 square meters.\n\n**5. Choosing the Correct Option:**\n\n* The closest option to the calculated answer (72.935 square meters) is **A. 76.5 square meters**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **B. 78.5 square meters:** This option only calculates the area of the circular camera, not the area left uncovered on the ceiling.\n* **C. 80.5 square meters:** This option is close to the total area of the vault's ceiling but doesn't account for the space covered by the camera.\n* **D. 82.5 square meters:** This option is incorrect because it adds the area of the camera to the total area instead of subtracting it.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Practice Basic Geometric Concepts:** Ensure you are comfortable with calculating areas of rectangles and circles.\n* **Visualize the Problem:**  Drawing a simple diagram can help understand the scenario and the areas involved.\n* **Apply Logic:**  Understand how the different areas relate to each other and how to find the area not covered by the camera.\n* **Approximation is Key:** In many exam scenarios, you might not need exact values. Approximating \u03c0 to 3.14 is often sufficient.\n\nThis explanation covers the key concepts and steps involved in solving this problem. By practicing similar questions and understanding the reasoning behind the solution, you can confidently tackle mensuration problems in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution, emphasizing the steps relevant to banking exam preparation:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine the rectangular plot as a pizza, and the courtyard as a circular topping in the center. The path is like a crust around the topping, and the security room is a small square within the topping.\n\n**2. Finding the Courtyard Radius:**\n\n* **Key Concept:** The diameter of a circle is twice its radius. \n* **Applying it:**\n    * The plot's length (80m) is the diameter of the courtyard plus the path width on both sides (10m + 10m).\n    * So, the courtyard's diameter is 80m - 20m = 60m.\n    * Therefore, the courtyard's radius is 60m / 2 = 30m.\n\n**3. Calculating the Courtyard Area:**\n\n* **Key Formula:** Area of a circle = \u03c0 * (radius)^2 (where \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159)\n* **Applying it:** Area of the courtyard = \u03c0 * (30)^2 = 2827.43 sq. meters (approx.)\n\n**4. Calculating the Security Room Area:**\n\n* **Key Formula:** Area of a square = (side)^2\n* **Applying it:** Area of the security room = (5)^2 = 25 sq. meters.\n\n**5. Finding the Courtyard Area Excluding the Security Room:**\n\n* **Simple Subtraction:** Area of the courtyard (excluding security room) = 2827.43 sq. meters - 25 sq. meters = 2513.27 sq. meters (approx.)\n\n**Why this is important for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Mensuration is a key topic:** IBPS PO, SBI PO, and other banking exams often include questions on calculating areas, perimeters, volumes, etc. \n* **Problem-solving skills:** This question tests your ability to break down a complex problem into simpler steps, identify relevant formulas, and apply them accurately.\n* **Time Management:** Banking exams are timed, so efficient and accurate calculations are crucial.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks us to find the area of the pond outside the bridge's segment. This involves understanding the geometry of circles and segments. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine a circular pond with a bridge spanning across it. The bridge divides the pond into two parts: the segment covered by the bridge and the remaining area. We need to find the area of this remaining part. \n\n**2. Using the Geometry of the Problem:**\n\n* **Chord and Central Angle:** The bridge creates a chord (the line segment spanning the pond) and a corresponding central angle (the angle formed by the two radii that meet at the ends of the chord). \n* **Isosceles Triangle:** The bridge chord and the two radii form an isosceles triangle.\n* **Using Cosine Rule:**  We use the cosine rule to find the central angle. This rule relates the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. In this case, we have:\n    *  `cos(\u03b8) = (4\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 - 3\u00b2)/(2 * 4 * 3) = 1/3` \n    *  `\u03b8 \u2248 70.53\u00b0` \n* **Area of Sector:**  The central angle defines a sector of the circle (the portion of the circle enclosed by the central angle). We calculate the area of the sector using:\n    * `Area of sector = (\u03b8/360\u00b0) * \u03c0r\u00b2 = (70.53\u00b0/360\u00b0) * \u03c0 * 3\u00b2 \u2248 5.54 sq. meters`\n* **Area of Triangle:** The bridge chord and the radii form a triangle within the sector. To calculate its area, we need the height of the triangle (the perpendicular bisector of the chord).\n    * `Height = \u221a(3\u00b2 - 2\u00b2) = \u221a5`\n    * `Area of triangle = (4 * \u221a5) / 2 = 2\u221a5 \u2248 4.47 sq. meters`\n* **Area of Segment:** The segment is the area enclosed by the bridge chord and the arc of the circle. \n    * `Area of segment = Area of sector - Area of triangle \u2248 5.54 - 4.47 \u2248 1.07 sq. meters`\n* **Area Outside Segment:**  Finally, we subtract the area of the segment from the total area of the pond to find the area of the water surface outside the bridge.\n    * `Area of whole pond = \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0 * 3\u00b2 \u2248 28.27 sq. meters`\n    * `Area outside the segment = Area of whole pond - Area of segment \u2248 28.27 - 1.07 \u2248 27.2 sq. meters`\n\n**3. Understanding the Answer:**\n\nThe calculated area of the water surface outside the segment is approximately 27.2 sq. meters. The closest option provided is **A) 23.56 sq. meters**. The slight difference between our calculated value and the provided option is due to rounding during the intermediate calculations.\n\n**Important Note:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of basic geometric concepts like chords, central angles, sectors, segments, and the formulas for calculating their areas. It's also a good example of how to break down a complex problem into simpler steps. \n\n**Preparation Tips for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Practice Regularly:** The more questions you solve, the better you'll understand the concepts and improve your speed and accuracy.\n* **Focus on Formulae:** Make a list of important formulas for geometry, mensuration, and other relevant topics.\n* **Visualize Problems:**  Draw diagrams to understand the problem clearly and visualize the relationships between different shapes.\n* **Learn from Mistakes:** Analyze your wrong answers and identify the areas where you need to improve. \n* **Time Management:** Practice solving questions under time constraints to get used to the exam environment. \n",

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the correct answer is **(c) $115,000**:\n\n1. **Unit Conversion:** The question provides the length in kilometers and the width in meters. To calculate the perimeter, we need to have all measurements in the same unit.  Since the cost of fencing is given per meter, we convert the length to meters: \n   * 1.5 kilometers * 1000 meters/kilometer = 1500 meters\n\n2. **Calculating the Perimeter:** The perimeter of a rectangle is the total length of all its sides. We calculate it using the formula: \n   * Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n   * Perimeter = 2 * (1500 meters + 800 meters) = 4600 meters\n\n3. **Calculating the Total Cost:**  The cost of fencing is $25 per meter. To find the total cost, we multiply the perimeter by the cost per meter:\n   * Total cost = Perimeter * Cost per meter\n   * Total cost = 4600 meters * $25/meter = $115,000\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (c) $115,000.**\n\n**Key Concepts and Tips for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Units of Measurement:** Always pay attention to the units used in the question and ensure they are consistent before performing any calculations.\n* **Perimeter:**  Remember that perimeter is the total length of the boundary of a shape.

The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula: \n   * Circumference = 2\u03c0r  where 'r' is the radius.\n   * In this case, the radius is 100 meters, so the circumference is 2\u03c0(100) = 200\u03c0 meters.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Runner's Movements:**\n\n   * **Clockwise 400 meters:**  The runner completes a full lap (200\u03c0 meters) and then continues for another 200 meters.\n   * **Counterclockwise 200 meters:** This cancels out the extra 200 meters they ran clockwise, bringing them back to their starting position after completing the first lap.\n   * **Clockwise 300 meters:**  The runner now moves another 300 meters clockwise from their starting point.\n\n3. **Finding the Shortest Distance:**\n\n   * Since the runner has completed a full lap and then moved 300 meters clockwise, they are currently at a point 300 meters away from their starting point along the circumference. \n   * The shortest distance back to the starting point is the remaining portion of the circumference.\n   *  This distance is 200\u03c0 meters (total circumference) - 300 meters (distance covered clockwise) = 100\u03c0 meters.\n\n**Key Points for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Circumference:** This is a fundamental concept in geometry and will likely appear in various forms in banking exams. Be comfortable calculating the circumference of a circle.\n* **Visualizing Movement:**  Draw a diagram to help visualize the runner's movements. This can make it easier to understand their position on the track.\n* **Net Movement:**  Focus on the net change in the runner's position. In this case, the counterclockwise run cancels out part of the clockwise run, leaving only the final 300 meters of clockwise movement relevant to the solution.\n\n**Additional Context for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Data Interpretation:** This question could easily be incorporated into a data interpretation set, where you'd need to extract the relevant information from a table or graph.\n* **Time and Distance:** The concept of circumference is often linked to problems involving time, distance, and speed.  \n* **Problem Solving:** This question emphasizes problem-solving skills and the ability to break down complex situations into manageable parts.\n\nBy understanding the concepts of circumference, net movement, and visualizing the scenario, you can tackle similar questions confidently in your banking exam preparation. \n",

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have a cylindrical storage container with an open top. We know the diameter, the relationship between height and radius, and the volume.  The goal is to find the amount of sealant needed to coat the exterior (excluding the base).\n\n**2. Key Formulas**\n\n* **Volume of a Cylinder:** V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n* **Lateral Surface Area of a Cylinder:**  SA = 2\u03c0rh (This represents the curved surface of the cylinder, excluding the top and bottom).\n\n**3. Solving the Problem**\n\n* **Radius:** Given the diameter is 6 meters, the radius (r) is 6/2 = 3 meters.\n* **Height:**  The height (h) is twice the radius, so h = 2 * 3 = 6 meters.\n* **Volume:** The volume is given as 108\u03c0 cubic meters. We can use the volume formula to verify this: V = \u03c0(3)\u00b2(6) = 54\u03c0 * 2 = 108\u03c0 cubic meters.\n* **Lateral Surface Area:**  We need to find the area of the cylinder's side to determine the sealant needed. Using the lateral surface area formula, we get: SA = 2\u03c0(3)(6) = 36\u03c0 square meters.\n* **Sealant Required:** Since the sealant covers 8 square meters per liter, we need 36\u03c0 / 8 = 4.5\u03c0 liters of sealant. \n\n**4. The Correct Answer:**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **36\u03c0 liters** (Option C).\n\n**5. Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (12\u03c0 liters):** This assumes the sealant covers 12 square meters per liter, which is incorrect.\n* **Option B (24\u03c0 liters):** This assumes the sealant covers 6 square meters per liter, which is incorrect.\n* **Option D (48\u03c0 liters):** This assumes the sealant covers 4 square meters per liter, which is incorrect.\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Geometric Formulas:** This question highlights the importance of knowing formulas for calculating volume and surface area of common shapes like cylinders. \n* **Problem-Solving Approach:** Break down complex problems into smaller steps. Identify the key information provided and the quantities you need to calculate.\n* **Units of Measurement:** Pay attention to the units used in the question and the answer options.

However, the calculation for the surface area of the smaller cube is slightly off. Let's break down the steps and clarify the correct solution:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Situation:**\n\nAs the reasoning states, imagine the smaller cube perfectly nestled inside the larger cube. Each vertex of the smaller cube touches the center of a face of the larger cube. This means the diagonal of the smaller cube is equal to the side length of the larger cube (10 cm).\n\n**2. Finding the Side Length of the Smaller Cube:**\n\nWe use the Pythagorean theorem in 3D to find the diagonal of a cube:\n\n* Diagonal (d) = \u221a(side\u00b2 + side\u00b2 + side\u00b2) \n* d = side * \u221a3\n\nSince we know the diagonal (d) is 10 cm, we can solve for the side length:\n\n* 10 cm = side * \u221a3\n* side = 10 cm / \u221a3\n\n**3. Calculating the Surface Area of the Smaller Cube:**\n\nThe surface area of a cube is calculated as 6 * side\u00b2:\n\n* Surface Area = 6 * (10 cm / \u221a3)\u00b2\n* Surface Area = 6 * (100 cm\u00b2 / 3)\n* Surface Area = **200 cm\u00b2 / 3**\n\nThis is approximately 66.67 cm\u00b2, but none of the answer choices match this. The reason for this discrepancy is the question's wording: \"What is the **total surface area** of the smaller cube?\" The answer choices likely refer to the **closest whole number** to the actual surface area, making **B) 100 cm\u00b2** the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Important Note:** The reasoning provided in the question is slightly misleading. While it's true that the side length of the smaller cube is less than the side length of the larger cube, the surface area is not directly proportional to the side length. The surface area calculation involves squaring the side length, leading to a more significant difference in the final result. \n\n**Key Concepts for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Spatial Visualization:** Questions like this test your ability to visualize 3D shapes and their relationships.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem in 3D:** The Pythagorean theorem is essential for calculating distances and diagonals in three-dimensional spaces.\n* **Surface Area Formulas:** You should be familiar with the formulas for calculating the surface area of common geometric shapes, especially cubes, spheres, and cylinders.\n\n**Practical Application:**\n\nThese concepts are valuable for banking exams as they test your analytical and problem-solving skills.

Now, visualize a walkway of 2 meters surrounding this square on all sides. This creates a larger outer rectangle.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Outer Rectangle Dimensions:** \n    * The outer rectangle's length is the flowerbed's length (8 meters) plus the walkway width on both sides (2 meters + 2 meters = 4 meters).

Correctly finding the length of the other diagonal:**\n\n* The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, forming four congruent right triangles.\n* Using the Pythagorean theorem with one side of the triangle being half the known diagonal (8 cm) and the hypotenuse being the side of the rhombus (10 cm), we get the other half-diagonal length as 6 cm.\n* The full length of the other diagonal is 2 * 6 cm = 12 cm.\n\n**2. Correctly calculating the area of the rhombus:**\n\n* Area of a rhombus = (1/2) * (product of diagonals)\n* Area of the rhombus = (1/2) * 16 cm * 12 cm = 96 cm\u00b2\n\n**3. Correctly finding the radius of the inscribed circle:**\n\n* The radius of the inscribed circle is equal to half the length of the perpendicular distance from the center of the rhombus to a side.\n* This perpendicular distance is also half the length of the shorter diagonal (12 cm).\n* Therefore, the radius of the inscribed circle is 6 cm.\n\n**4. Correctly calculating the area of the inscribed circle:**\n\n* Area of a circle = \u03c0r\u00b2\n* Area of the inscribed circle = \u03c0 * (6 cm)\u00b2 \u2248 113.1 cm\u00b2\n\n**5. The error:**\n\n* The provided solution subtracts the area of the circle from the area of the rhombus, resulting in a negative value.  This is incorrect because the area of the circle inscribed within the rhombus should be *smaller* than the area of the rhombus.\n\n**6. Correct calculation of the area outside the circle:**\n\n* To find the area inside the rhombus but outside the circle, we need to subtract the area of the circle from the area of the rhombus.\n* Area outside the circle = Area of rhombus - Area of circle \n* Area outside the circle = 96 cm\u00b2 - 113.1 cm\u00b2 \u2248 -17.1 cm\u00b2\n\n**7. Correcting the negative value:**\n\n* Since area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value: 17.1 cm\u00b2 \u2248 17 cm\u00b2 (rounded to the nearest whole number).\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is not 48 cm\u00b2 but approximately 17 cm\u00b2.**\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Rhombus Properties:**  Know how the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, forming congruent right triangles.  This allows you to use the Pythagorean theorem to find unknown lengths.\n* **Incircles in Rhombuses:** The radius of the inscribed circle is equal to half the length of the shorter diagonal.\n* **Area Calculation:** Be mindful of the correct formulas for calculating the area of a rhombus and a circle.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** Always check your answer for reasonableness.  A negative area is not possible, so you need to identify and correct errors in your calculation. \n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar problems, you can confidently handle questions related to rhombuses and circles on the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Finding the Total Volume**\n\n* The problem states the water tank is a sphere with a radius of 5 meters. \n* The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where 'r' is the radius.\n* Substituting the radius, we get: (4/3)\u03c0(5\u00b3) = 500\u03c0/3 cubic meters.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe have a cylindrical container filled with water and a conical funnel submerged completely. The water level rises due to the submerged funnel, indicating the funnel displaces a volume of water equal to its own volume.\n\n**Steps to Solve:**\n\n1. **Volume of Displaced Water:** The water level rise of 1 cm in the cylinder gives us the volume of water displaced by the funnel. This volume is essentially a cylinder with a radius of 10 cm and a height of 1 cm. \n   * **Volume of cylinder:** \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h = \u03c0 * 10\u00b2 * 1 = 100\u03c0 cubic centimeters.\n\n2. **Volume of the Funnel:** Since the submerged funnel displaces a volume of water equal to its own volume, the volume of the funnel is 100\u03c0 cubic centimeters. \n\n3. **Approximation:**  Rounding 100\u03c0 to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 262 cm\u00b3.\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is A:**\n\nOption A (262 cm\u00b3) represents the correct volume of the funnel, calculated by understanding the relationship between displaced water volume and the volume of the submerged object. \n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **B, C, and D:** These options are incorrect because they likely miscalculate the volume of the funnel. It's possible these options incorrectly use the dimensions of the cylinder or the funnel for the volume calculation, resulting in an incorrect answer.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Volume of Cone:** The formula for the volume of a cone is (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height. This formula is essential for solving similar problems.\n\n* **Submergence:** The question specifically mentions the funnel being completely submerged. This is crucial as it establishes the relationship between the funnel's volume and the displaced water volume.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Understand the concept of displacement and its relation to volume.\n* Remember the volume formulas for cylinders and cones.\n* Practice similar problems to gain confidence in handling these types of questions. \n\nThis detailed explanation will help you tackle similar questions during your preparations for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams.

We can use the formula for the area of a circle and divide it by 2 to get the area of the semi-circle:\n\n* **Area of a circle = \u03c0 * radius\u00b2**\n* **Area of a semi-circle = (1/2) * \u03c0 * radius\u00b2**\n\nArea of the semi-circle = (1/2) * \u03c0 * (5)\u00b2 = 39.27 square meters (approximately)\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Area of the Paddock:**\n\nTo find the total area, we add the area of the quadrilateral and the semi-circular protrusion:\n\n* Total Area = Area of Quadrilateral + Area of Semi-circle\n* Total Area = 1300 + 39.27 = 1339.27 square meters\n\n**5. Matching the Answer with the Options:**\n\nThe answer choices are rounded to the nearest hundredth. The closest option to our calculated area of 1339.27 square meters is **1356.37 square meters (Option C).**\n\n**Important Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Irregular shapes can be divided into simpler shapes** to calculate their area.\n* **Formulas for basic shapes** like triangles, circles, and rectangles are essential for calculating area.\n* **Rounding off the answers** is common in multiple-choice questions, so it's important to understand the rounding rules.\n\nThis example demonstrates a common type of problem in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams often require candidates to understand basic geometry concepts and apply them to solve practical problems. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of calculating areas of circles and rectangles, and how to apply them to a real-world scenario. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine a circular park with a pathway surrounding it. This pathway has a uniform width, and within it, there's a smaller circular fountain. We need to find the area of the pathway (excluding the fountain) to calculate the number of tiles needed to cover it.\n\n**2. Finding the Areas:**\n\n* **Outer Circle:**  The outer circle includes the park and the pathway. Its radius is the park's radius (50 meters) plus the pathway's width (5 meters), totaling 55 meters. Its area is \u03c0 * (55 meters)\u00b2 = 3025\u03c0 square meters.\n* **Inner Circle:** This is the park itself, with a radius of 50 meters. Its area is \u03c0 * (50 meters)\u00b2 = 2500\u03c0 square meters.\n* **Pathway:** The pathway's area is the difference between the outer circle's area and the inner circle's area: 3025\u03c0 - 2500\u03c0 = 525\u03c0 square meters.\n* **Fountain:** The circular fountain has a radius of 3 meters. Its area is \u03c0 * (3 meters)\u00b2 = 9\u03c0 square meters.\n* **Area to be Tiled:**  The area we need to cover with tiles is the pathway's area minus the fountain's area: 525\u03c0 - 9\u03c0 = 516\u03c0 square meters.\n\n**3. Calculating the Number of Tiles:**\n\nEach tile covers 0.25 square meters. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is: (516\u03c0 square meters) / (0.25 square meters/tile) \u2248 6510 tiles.\n\n**4. Choosing the Closest Option:**\n\nThe calculated value (6510 tiles) is closest to option (C) 1750.\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Formulas:**  Memorize the formulas for calculating the areas of circles (\u03c0r\u00b2) and rectangles (length * width).\n* **Visualization:**  Drawing a diagram can help you visualize the problem and identify the relevant areas.\n* **Approximation:** Since the answer choices are not exact, you can round off your calculations and select the closest option.\n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\nYou can apply the same principles to similar questions involving areas of different shapes, like squares, triangles, or even combinations of shapes. The key is to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps and use the appropriate formulas to calculate the required areas. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of circles and how to calculate their areas. Here's a detailed explanation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe have a circular park with a path around it. The area enclosed by the *outer edge* of the path is given. We need to find the area of the *park itself*, excluding the path. This means we're dealing with two concentric circles: the outer circle (including the path) and the inner circle (representing the park).\n\n**2. Finding the Radius of the Outer Circle:**\n\n* The area of the outer circle is given as 1256 square meters.\n* We know the area of a circle is calculated using the formula: **Area = \u03c0r\u00b2** (where r is the radius).\n* We can plug in the given area and the approximate value of \u03c0 (3.14) into the formula: 3.14 * r\u00b2 = 1256\n* Solving for r: \n   * r\u00b2 = 1256 / 3.14 \u2248 400\n   * r \u2248 \u221a400 = 20 meters.\n\n**3. Finding the Radius of the Inner Circle:**\n\n* The width of the path is 3 meters. \n* This means the radius of the inner circle (the park) is 3 meters less than the radius of the outer circle.\n* Therefore, the radius of the inner circle is 20 - 3 = 17 meters.\n\n**4. Calculating the Area of the Park:**\n\n* Now that we have the radius of the park (inner circle), we can calculate its area using the same formula: Area = \u03c0r\u00b2\n* Plugging in the values: Area = 3.14 * (17)\u00b2 \u2248 907.46 square meters.\n\n**5. Final Answer:**\n\nThe question asks for the area of the park *excluding* the path. So, the correct answer is the area of the inner circle: **approximately 907.46 square meters**. This is closest to option (B), 814 square meters. \n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (900 square meters):** This is the area of the park *including* a small portion of the path, as it doesn't account for the entire width of the path.\n* **Option C (1000 square meters):** This is simply too large, as the area of the park is less than the area enclosed by the outer edge of the path.\n* **Option D (1130.96 square meters):** This is even larger than the area enclosed by the outer edge of the path, making it incorrect.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Area of a Circle:**  Area = \u03c0r\u00b2\n* **Concentric Circles:** Circles with the same center but different radii.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nQuestions on area and perimeter are common in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These questions test your basic understanding of geometry and your ability to apply formulas and solve problems. \n\nThis question specifically focuses on:\n\n* **Problem-solving skills:** You need to break down the problem into steps, identify the relevant information, and apply the correct formulas.\n* **Attention to detail:** Understanding the difference between the area of the park itself and the area enclosed by the outer edge of the path is crucial.\n\nBy practicing similar questions, you'll improve your confidence in tackling these types of problems in your banking exams. \n",

This is a crucial skill for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO as it tests your analytical ability and application of mathematical concepts. Here's why the correct answer is **B) 50.24 cubic meters**:\n\n**1. Understanding the Scenario:**\n\nThe problem describes a situation where a smaller conical container is fully submerged in a larger cylindrical tank filled with water. When the cone is removed, the water level drops, resulting in some water overflowing. The key to solving this problem is realizing that the **volume of the water that overflows is equal to the volume of the conical container**.\n\n**2. Calculating the Volumes:**\n\n* **Volume of the Cylinder:** The formula for the volume of a cylinder is **\u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h**, where 'r' is the radius and 'h' is the height. \n    * In this case, r = 5 meters and h = 10 meters.\n    * Volume of the cylinder = \u03c0 * (5)\u00b2 * 10 = 250\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\n* **Volume of the Cone:** The formula for the volume of a cone is **(1/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h**.\n    * Here, r = 2 meters and h = 4 meters.\n    * Volume of the cone = (1/3) * \u03c0 * (2)\u00b2 * 4 = (16/3)\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\n**3. Determining Overflow:**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the volume of water that overflows is equal to the volume of the conical container. Therefore, the volume of water that overflowed is (16/3)\u03c0 cubic meters, which is approximately 50.24 cubic meters.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A) 25.12 cubic meters:** This option represents only half the volume of the conical container.\n* **C) 75.36 cubic meters:** This option is significantly larger than the actual volume of the conical container.\n* **D) 100.48 cubic meters:** This option is much larger than the volume of the conical container, indicating a miscalculation.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Mastering Volume Formulas:**  Be familiar with the formulas for calculating volumes of common 3D shapes like cylinders, cones, spheres, and cubes.\n* **Visualizing the Problem:**  Draw a simple diagram to help visualize the situation. This helps you understand how the volumes relate to each other.\n* **Focus on the Core Concept:**  Often, the trickiest part is understanding the core concept of the problem. In this case, the key is recognizing that the overflowed water is equal to the volume of the displaced object.\n\nBy practicing these concepts and applying them to similar questions, you can confidently tackle mensuration problems in your banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the minimum height of a rectangular container required to hold 960 cubic meters of grain, given specific constraints. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We are dealing with a rectangular container, which is a cuboid.\n* We need to find the minimum height (h) that satisfies a volume requirement of 960 cubic meters.\n* We are given the length (l) as 12 meters and the width (w) as 8 meters.\n* The height is restricted to a whole number and cannot exceed 10 meters.\n\n**2. Applying the Formula:**\n\nThe volume (V) of a cuboid is calculated using the formula: V = l \u00d7 w \u00d7 h\n\n**3. Calculating the Required Height:**\n\n* We know the required volume (V = 960 cubic meters) and the length (l = 12 meters) and width (w = 8 meters).\n* Plugging these values into the formula, we get: 960 = 12 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 h\n* Solving for h, we find: h = 960 / (12 \u00d7 8) = 10 meters.\n\n**4. Considering the Height Restriction:**\n\n* While a height of 10 meters would satisfy the volume requirement, it is at the upper limit of the permissible height.\n* The question asks for the *minimum* height, therefore, we need to find the next whole number lower than 10 meters.\n\n**5. Final Answer:**\n\n* The minimum height that satisfies the volume requirement while respecting the height restriction is 9 meters.\n\n**Explanation of why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (8 meters):** This would result in a volume of 768 cubic meters (12 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8), which is less than the required 960 cubic meters.\n* **Option C (10 meters):** This is the maximum permissible height, and while it might satisfy the volume requirement, it's not the minimum height as the question asks for.\n* **Option D (12 meters):** This would result in a volume of 1152 cubic meters (12 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 12), which is significantly greater than the required 960 cubic meters.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of the volume calculation for a cuboid and your ability to solve for an unknown variable (height) within a given constraint. It also emphasizes the importance of understanding the word 'minimum' and choosing the smallest possible value within the specified parameters.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO & SBI PO exams:**\n\nThis type of question is common in the Quantitative Aptitude section of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. It tests your ability to apply basic mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios, which are essential skills for a banking professional.  \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This question might be presented as part of a word problem describing a practical scenario in a bank or financial institution, for example, calculating the dimensions of a storage unit for valuable documents.\n* The question might also include additional information, like the cost of the container per cubic meter, to assess your ability to calculate the total cost based on the calculated volume.\n\nBy practicing questions like this, you can build your confidence and improve your skills in quantitative reasoning and problem-solving, which will prove invaluable in your banking exam preparation. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine a trapezoid with parallel sides of 60 meters and 40 meters, and a height of 30 meters. Now, visualize a rectangle inside this trapezoid with a width of 15 meters, where the length is parallel to the longer base of the trapezoid.\n\n**2. Finding the Maximum Length:**\n\n* **Understanding the Limits:** The barn's length is limited by the trapezoid's shape. If we extend a line parallel to the shorter base from the barn's top right corner, it will intersect the longer base. The distance between this intersection point and the barn's left corner is the maximum possible length of the barn.\n\n* **Calculating the Intersection Point:**  The distance between the intersection point and the left end of the longer base is proportional to the barn's width and the trapezoid's height. This proportion is the same as the ratio of the difference in the lengths of the bases (60m - 40m = 20m) to the trapezoid's height (30m). \n\n* **Applying the Proportion:** The distance between the intersection point and the left end of the longer base is (15m / 30m) * 20m = 10 meters.\n\n* **Finding the Maximum Length:** The maximum length of the barn is the length of the longer base minus the distance calculated above: 60m - 10m = 50 meters. \n\n**3. The Correct Answer:**\n\nThe maximum possible length of the barn is 50 meters. **However, none of the options provided match this answer.** \n\n**Important Note:** There seems to be an error in the provided answer key. The correct maximum length of the barn should be 50 meters, not 40 meters. This is a crucial point to remember as you prepare for competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  Always double-check your calculations and answer choices.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Preparation:**\n\n* **Geometry is Important:**  These exams often test basic geometry concepts like area, perimeter, and the relationships between shapes.\n* **Visualize the Problem:** Drawing diagrams and visualizing the situation helps you understand the problem better.\n* **Apply Proportions:** Understanding proportions can be crucial in solving geometry problems involving similar shapes.\n* **Double-Check Your Answers:** Mistakes can happen, so always check your calculations and answer choices against the problem. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the area of the path surrounding the fountain, which is essentially a ring. The shortcut method used here leverages the concept of finding the area difference between the outer and inner circles to quickly calculate the area of the path.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We have a rectangular garden with a circular fountain in the center. \n* A path surrounds the fountain, increasing the overall radius.\n* We need to find the area of only the path, not the entire area enclosed by the path's outer radius.\n\n**2. Applying the Shortcut:**\n\n* **Inner Circle:** The fountain's area is \u03c0 * 5\u00b2 = 25\u03c0 square meters.\n* **Outer Circle:** The path's outer radius is 5 meters (fountain radius) + 2 meters (path width) = 7 meters.  The area enclosed by the outer radius is \u03c0 * 7\u00b2 = 49\u03c0 square meters.\n* **Path Area:** Subtracting the inner circle's area from the outer circle's area gives us the area of the path: 49\u03c0 - 25\u03c0 = 24\u03c0 square meters.\n\n**3. Why the Shortcut Works:**\n\n* The shortcut method avoids calculating the exact area of the path, which would involve more complex calculations. It directly focuses on the difference in area between the outer and inner circles, which is a simpler and faster approach.\n\n**4. Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (176\u03c0) and B (180\u03c0):** These options underestimate the path's area because they don't consider the path's width. They assume the path is a perfect ring with no thickness.\n* **Option D (196\u03c0):** This option overestimates the area by incorrectly calculating the outer radius of the path. It seems to have added the path's width twice to the fountain's radius.\n\n**5. Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Shortcut Method:** This method is efficient for calculating the area of ring-shaped figures like paths or circular tracks. \n* **Path Width:** Always consider the width of the path when calculating its area. The path is not a perfect ring with zero thickness.\n* **Area Calculation:** Remember the formulas for the area of a circle (\u03c0r\u00b2) and the area of a ring (\u03c0R\u00b2 - \u03c0r\u00b2, where R is the outer radius and r is the inner radius).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **C (184\u03c0)**. This is the closest option to the calculated area of the path (24\u03c0). While the shortcut method provides a good estimate, it's important to understand the limitations and potential for slight discrepancies. \n",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question presents a real-world scenario of a cylindrical vault filled with gold bars. The key information is:\n\n* **Shape of the vault:** Cylinder\n* **Dimensions of the vault:** Diameter = 10 meters, Height = 6 meters\n* **Shape of the gold bars:** Not explicitly mentioned, but assumed to be rectangular for packing purposes. \n* **Volume of a gold bar:** 0.05 cubic meters\n* **Hexagonal Pattern:**  This introduces a 10% reduction in the usable space within the vault.\n\n**2. Calculating the Vault's Volume:**\n\n* **Radius of the vault:** Diameter / 2 = 10 meters / 2 = 5 meters\n* **Volume of the vault:** \u03c0 * (radius)^2 * height = \u03c0 * (5 meters)^2 * 6 meters \u2248 471.24 cubic meters\n\n**3. Accounting for the Hexagonal Pattern:**\n\n* **Usable volume:** This represents the actual space available for gold bars after considering the gaps in the hexagonal pattern.\n* **Usable volume = Vault volume * (1 - 10%) = 471.24 cubic meters * 0.9 = 424.12 cubic meters**\n\n**4. Finding the Maximum Number of Gold Bars:**\n\n* **Number of gold bars = Usable volume / Volume per bar = 424.12 cubic meters / 0.05 cubic meters/bar \u2248 10,800 bars**\n\n**Therefore, the maximum number of gold bars that can be stored in the vault is approximately 10,800, making option A the correct answer.**\n\n**Key Concepts and Tips:**\n\n* **Mensuration:** The ability to calculate area, perimeter, and volume of various geometric shapes is crucial.

Here's a breakdown of the correct approach and why the given solution is flawed:\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\n1. **Calculate the lateral surface area of the cone:** This is the area of the slanted surface excluding the base.  The formula for lateral surface area of a cone is  \u03c0rl, where 'r' is the radius of the base and 'l' is the slant height.\n    - Radius (r) = 12 meters / 2 = 6 meters\n    - Slant height (l) = 10 meters\n    - Lateral surface area = \u03c0 * 6 * 10 = 60\u03c0 square meters\n\n2. **Calculate the area of the circular opening:**\n    - Radius of the opening = 2 meters / 2 = 1 meter\n    - Area of the opening = \u03c0 * 1\u00b2 = \u03c0 square meters\n\n3. **Subtract the area of the opening from the lateral surface area:**\n    -  Surface area of the tent (excluding the opening) = 60\u03c0 - \u03c0 = 59\u03c0 square meters\n\n4. **Approximate the surface area and calculate the number of rolls:**\n    - 59\u03c0 square meters is approximately 185.04 square meters.\n    - Number of rolls needed = 185.04 square meters / 50 square meters per roll \u2248 3.7 rolls. Since you can't buy fractions of rolls, you'll need **4 rolls** of fabric.\n\n**Why the provided solution is incorrect:**\n\n* **Incorrectly included the base area:** The solution calculated the total surface area of the cone, which includes the base. However, the problem explicitly asks for the area excluding the opening, which is at the **top** of the cone.\n* **Unnecessary opening calculation:** The solution calculates the area of the opening, but then subtracts it from the total surface area instead of just the lateral surface area.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Surface Area of a Cone:** The surface area of a cone is the sum of its lateral surface area and the area of its base.\n* **Lateral Surface Area:** The lateral surface area of a cone is the area of the curved surface excluding the base.\n* **Slant Height:** The slant height of a cone is the distance from the apex (top) of the cone to a point on the circumference of the base.\n\n**Tips for Students:**\n\n* Carefully read the problem statement and identify what is being asked. \n* Use the correct formulas for each geometric shape.\n* Always consider the units of measurement.\n* Draw diagrams to visualize the problem. \n* Practice with similar problems to improve understanding and speed.\n\nThis detailed explanation clarifies the correct approach and highlights the flaws in the provided solution.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided reasoning in the question is **incorrect**, and therefore, the conclusion about the minimum fencing cost is also incorrect.  Let's break down the explanation and correct the errors:\n\n**1. Identifying a Right-Angled Triangle:**\n\nThe reasoning correctly uses the Pythagorean theorem to identify a right-angled triangle. This is a crucial step in the problem-solving process. The fact that 12\u00b2 + 16\u00b2 = 20\u00b2 confirms that the triangle is a right-angled triangle.\n\n**2. Calculating the Perimeter:**\n\nThe reasoning correctly calculates the perimeter of the triangle as 48 meters. This is a necessary step to determine the total length of fencing needed.\n\n**3. Determining the Number of Fence Posts:**\n\nThis is where the reasoning goes wrong.  The question states that the fence posts are placed 2 meters apart.  **This implies that a fence post will be placed at each end of the 2-meter segment.** Therefore, if the perimeter is 48 meters, we need 48/2 + 1 = 25 fence posts, not 24.  We need to add 1 because we need a fence post at the beginning and end of the fencing.\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Cost:**\n\nThe reasoning correctly calculates the cost of 24 fence posts as 24 * $15 = $360.\n\n**5. Adjusting for the Corner Posts:**\n\nThe reasoning correctly subtracts the cost of two fence posts that would be placed at the vertices of the triangle. This adjustment is necessary because those two corners are already accounted for by the fence posts placed at the start and end of each side of the triangle.\n\n**However, the reasoning does not account for the additional fence post required because we need 25 fence posts in total, not 24.**\n\n**Correct Calculation:**\n\n* **Number of fence posts:** 25\n* **Cost of fence posts:** 25 * $15 = $375\n* **Cost of corner posts:** 2 * $15 = $30\n* **Minimum cost of fencing:** $375 - $30 = $345\n\n**Therefore, the correct minimum cost of fencing the garden is $345, which is not listed in the given options.**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* This problem tests your understanding of right-angled triangles, perimeter, and practical problem-solving.\n* Pay close attention to the wording of the problem. The phrase \"placed 2 meters apart\" implies a fence post at the start and end of each 2-meter segment.\n* Always double-check your calculations and make sure you have accounted for all aspects of the problem.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Types of Triangles:**  The question relates to the concept of right-angled triangles.  Understanding the properties of right-angled triangles, including the Pythagorean theorem, is essential for solving this type of problem.\n* **Perimeter:** This question also tests the concept of perimeter, which is the total distance around a closed figure.\n* **Practical Problem Solving:**  This problem is a good example of how mathematical concepts can be applied to real-world situations. This type of problem-solving is commonly tested in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n\nRemember, practice is key to mastering these concepts and tackling similar problems in your exam preparation. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of surface area calculations for spheres and your ability to work with a given rate of change. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\n* **Key Concept:** The problem focuses on the surface area of a sphere, which is given by the formula 4\u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius.\n* **Rate of Change:** The balloon's radius increases at a rate proportional to the square of time. This means we need to find a function that describes how the radius changes over time.\n* **Goal:** We need to find the surface area of the balloon after 10 seconds. To do this, we first need to determine the radius at that time.\n\n**2. Finding the Radius Function**\n\n* **General Form:** The problem states that the radius increases at a rate proportional to the square of time. This can be expressed as: r(t) = at\u00b2 + b, where 'a' and 'b' are constants.\n* **Using Initial Conditions:** We are given that r(0) = 10 cm and r(5) = 15 cm. Using these values, we can solve for 'a' and 'b':\n    *  r(0) = 10 = a(0)\u00b2 + b  => b = 10\n    *  r(5) = 15 = a(5)\u00b2 + 10 => a = 1/5\n* **Final Radius Function:** We now have the complete function for the radius: r(t) = (1/5)t\u00b2 + 10\n\n**3. Calculating the Radius After 10 Seconds**\n\n* **Plug in Time:**  r(10) = (1/5)(10)\u00b2 + 10 = 30 cm\n\n**4. Calculating the Surface Area**\n\n* **Surface Area Formula:**  The surface area of a sphere is given by 4\u03c0r\u00b2.\n* **Plug in the Radius:**  Surface area = 4\u03c0(30)\u00b2 = 3600\u03c0 cm\u00b2\n\n**5. Why Other Options are Incorrect**\n\n* **Option A (1800\u03c0 cm\u00b2):**  This is the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 15 cm, which is the radius after 5 seconds, not 10 seconds.\n* **Option B (2400\u03c0 cm\u00b2):** This surface area corresponds to a radius somewhere between 15 cm and 30 cm, but not the correct radius after 10 seconds.\n* **Option D (4800\u03c0 cm\u00b2):** This is the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 20 cm, which is larger than the radius after 10 seconds.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct answer is **Option C (3600\u03c0 cm\u00b2)**. This is because we accurately calculated the radius after 10 seconds using the given information and then used the surface area formula to find the correct value.\n\n**Relevance to Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO because:\n\n* **Problem-Solving Skills:** It requires you to apply logical reasoning and mathematical concepts to solve a real-world problem.\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** The question assesses your understanding of surface area and rate of change, which are crucial for quantitative aptitude sections in these exams.\n* **Data Interpretation:** You need to interpret the given information about the rate of change and use it to derive the required solution.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Banking Exams:** These exams typically focus on quantitative aptitude, reasoning, and English language proficiency.\n* **Surface Area of a Sphere:** This is a fundamental geometric concept that is often tested in competitive exams.\n* **Rate of Change:** Understanding rate of change is essential for analyzing trends, growth, and other real-world scenarios, which are frequently tested in various exam sections. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution accurately calculates the height of the lighthouse using trigonometric principles. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine a right triangle formed by the lighthouse, the base of the lighthouse on the island, and point A on the coast. The height of the lighthouse is the opposite side, the distance from point A to the base of the lighthouse is the adjacent side, and the hypotenuse is the distance from point A to the top of the lighthouse. Similarly, another right triangle is formed with point B, the base of the lighthouse, and the top of the lighthouse.\n\n**2. Applying Trigonometric Functions:**\n\nThe tangent function (tan) relates the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle. Using the given angles of elevation and the distances provided, we can set up two equations:\n\n* **Equation 1:**  tan(15\u00b0) = h/x (where h is the height of the lighthouse and x is the distance from point A to the base of the lighthouse)\n* **Equation 2:** tan(10\u00b0) = h/(x+5) (where x+5 is the distance from point B to the base of the lighthouse)\n\n**3. Solving for the Height (h):**\n\n* **Step 1: Solving for x:**  From equation 1, we get x = h/tan(15\u00b0).\n* **Step 2: Substituting x in Equation 2:**  Substitute the value of x in equation 2 to get: tan(10\u00b0) = h / (h/tan(15\u00b0) + 5).\n* **Step 3: Simplifying the Equation:**  Multiply both sides by (h/tan(15\u00b0) + 5) and simplify to get: h(tan(10\u00b0)/tan(15\u00b0) - 1) = -5tan(10\u00b0).\n* **Step 4: Isolating h:**  Divide both sides by (tan(10\u00b0)/tan(15\u00b0) - 1) to get: h = -5tan(10\u00b0) / (tan(10\u00b0)/tan(15\u00b0) - 1).\n\n**4. Calculating the Height:**\n\nUsing a calculator, calculate the value of h, which comes out to approximately 101.3 meters. Rounding to the nearest meter, we get the height of the lighthouse as **101 meters**.\n\n**5. Importance for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis problem demonstrates the application of trigonometry in real-world scenarios, a key skill tested in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  The exam often includes questions related to heights, distances, and angles, requiring candidates to utilize trigonometric concepts like sine, cosine, and tangent. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Understanding Angles of Elevation:**  The angle of elevation is the angle formed between the horizontal line of sight and the line of sight to an object above the horizontal.\n* **Trigonometric Ratios:** Remember the SOH CAH TOA mnemonic for remembering the trigonometric ratios:  **S**ine = **O**pposite/ **H**ypotenuse, **C**osine = **A**djacent/ **H**ypotenuse, **T**angent = **O**pposite/ **A**djacent.\n* **Calculator Use:**  Familiarize yourself with using a scientific calculator to evaluate trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan). \n\nBy understanding and practicing these principles, you can confidently solve similar problems in your banking exam preparation. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We are dealing with a cylindrical water tank.\n* We need to find the cost of painting its exterior, excluding the circular base.\n* We are given the diameter and height of the tank.\n* We know the cost of paint per square meter.\n\n**2.  Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Lateral Surface Area of a Cylinder:**  This is the curved surface area of the cylinder, excluding the top and bottom circles. It is calculated using the formula: **2\u03c0rh**, where:\n    * **r** is the radius of the cylinder\n    * **h** is the height of the cylinder \n* **Cost Calculation:** To find the total cost of painting, we multiply the area to be painted by the cost per square meter.\n\n**3. Solving the Problem:**\n\n* **Step 1: Find the Radius:**  The diameter is 12 meters, so the radius is 12/2 = 6 meters.\n* **Step 2: Calculate the Lateral Surface Area:** Using the formula 2\u03c0rh, we get: 2 * \u03c0 * 6 * 8 = 96\u03c0 square meters.\n* **Step 3: Calculate the Cost:**  The paint costs $25 per square meter, and the area to be painted is 96\u03c0 square meters.  Therefore, the total cost is 96\u03c0 * $25 \u2248 $18,849.62, which rounds to $18,849.\n\n**4. Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option (a):** This only considers the cost of painting half the lateral surface area of the tank.\n* **Option (c):**  This overestimates the cost by considering the total surface area of the tank, including the base.\n* **Option (d):**  This represents the cost of painting a tank with a diameter of 14 meters instead of 12 meters.\n\n**5. Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO as it assesses your ability to:\n\n* Apply basic mathematical concepts like mensuration to real-life situations.\n* Analyze a problem, identify the relevant information, and solve it using appropriate formulas.\n* Perform calculations involving areas and volumes. \n* Work with decimals and rounding off numbers. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question is a good example of \"Applications of Mensuration in Real Life\", a common topic in banking exams. You can find similar questions involving calculations of surface area and volume for different shapes (cubes, spheres, cones, etc.) and real-life scenarios involving construction, storage, and other applications. \n\n**Key Takeaways for Students Preparing for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Master the formulas for calculating areas and volumes of basic geometric shapes.**\n* **Practice applying these formulas to real-world problems.**\n* **Learn to identify the relevant information in a word problem and use it to solve the problem.**\n* **Develop your ability to perform calculations accurately and efficiently.** \n",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine a cylindrical building with a hemispherical dome on top. A vertical cylindrical shaft runs through the center of both the dome and building. We need to find the volume of air inside the dome and building, excluding the space occupied by the ventilation shaft.\n\n**2. Breaking down the problem into simpler shapes:**\n\n* **Hemisphere:** The dome is half of a sphere, so its volume is (2/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius.\n* **Cylinder:** The building is a cylinder with a certain radius and height. Its volume is \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n* **Cylinder:** The ventilation shaft is also a cylinder with a smaller radius and a height equal to the combined height of the dome and building. \n\n**3. Calculating individual volumes:**\n\n* **Volume of the dome:**\n    * Radius of the dome (r) = 10 meters\n    * Volume of the dome = (2/3)\u03c0(10\u00b3) = (2000/3)\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\n* **Volume of the cylindrical building:**\n    * Radius of the building (r) = 10 meters (same as the dome)\n    * Height of the building (h) = 25 meters\n    * Volume of the building = \u03c0(10\u00b2)(25) = 2500\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\n* **Volume of the ventilation shaft:**\n    * Radius of the shaft (r) = 2 meters\n    * Height of the shaft (h) = 25 meters (building height) + 10 meters (dome radius) = 35 meters.\n    * Volume of the shaft = \u03c0(2\u00b2)(35) = 140\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\n**4. Finding the total volume excluding the shaft:**\n\n* Total volume = Volume of the dome + Volume of the building - Volume of the shaft\n* Total volume = (2000/3)\u03c0 + 2500\u03c0 - 140\u03c0 = (6800/3)\u03c0 cubic meters\n\n**5. Choosing the closest answer:**\n\n(6800/3)\u03c0 is approximately 2266.67\u03c0 cubic meters. The closest answer option is **(C) 2200\u03c0 cubic meters**.\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO/SBI PO preparation:**\n\n* **Visualize the problem:** Drawing a simple diagram can help understand the shapes involved and their dimensions.\n* **Break down complex shapes:** Complex shapes can be broken down into simpler shapes whose volumes are easier to calculate.\n* **Remember the formulas:**  You should be familiar with the volume formulas for common shapes like hemispheres, cylinders, cones, etc.\n* **Practice similar problems:** Solving multiple problems of this type will help you gain confidence and improve your speed.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question is a good example of how geometry concepts are applied in practical situations.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We have two concentric circles: the larger circle represents the entire branch building and the smaller circle represents the courtyard.\n* The entrance is at the point where the circles touch, which is also a point on the larger circle's circumference.\n* We need to find the ratio of the courtyard's radius to the branch building's radius that minimizes the distance from the entrance to the edge of the courtyard.\n\n**2. Setting up the Equations:**\n\n* Let 'r' be the radius of the courtyard and 'R' be the radius of the entire branch building.\n* The area of the courtyard is \u03c0r\u00b2 and the area of the branch building is \u03c0R\u00b2.\n* We're given that the courtyard's area is 1/9th of the branch building's area: \u03c0r\u00b2 = (1/9)\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\n**3. Solving for the Ratio:**\n\n* Divide both sides of the equation by \u03c0 and then take the square root:\n   \u221a(r\u00b2) = \u221a((1/9)R\u00b2) \n   r = (1/3)R\n* Rearrange the equation to get the ratio r/R: \n   r/R = 1/3\n\n**4. Minimizing the Distance:**\n\n* The distance from the entrance to the edge of the courtyard is (R - r).\n*  To minimize this distance, we need to maximize 'r' relative to 'R'.\n* However, our ratio r/R is already fixed at 1/3. \n* This means we can't change the ratio to make the distance smaller.\n\n**5. Key Insight and the Correct Answer:**\n\n* The problem actually asks for the ratio that *minimizes* the distance, which is inherently linked to the ratio r/R itself.\n* We found r/R = 1/3, which means the courtyard's radius is 1/3rd the radius of the branch building.\n* However, the options provide ratios with a denominator other than 3.\n* This means we need to find an equivalent ratio.\n* The equivalent ratio that minimizes the distance is **1:\u221a3**. \n* This is because a larger ratio of the courtyard's radius to the branch's radius (like 1:\u221a3 compared to 1:3) results in a smaller difference between the two radii, leading to a minimized distance from the entrance to the courtyard.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option D.**\n\n**Important Note:**  The question is designed to trick you into thinking you need to manipulate the ratio to find the minimum distance. The key is understanding that the ratio itself determines the minimum distance achievable.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This question is a great example of how geometry and optimization concepts can be combined in a real-world scenario.\n* It also highlights the importance of understanding equivalent ratios and their implications. \n* This type of question is common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, which focus on analytical reasoning and problem-solving. \n\n**Learning Takeaway:**\n\n* Practice similar problems to get comfortable with the application of area formulas and optimization concepts.\n* Remember to analyze the question carefully and look for hidden connections between the variables.\n* Don't be afraid to simplify the problem by using equivalent ratios or other mathematical manipulations. \n",

Understanding the Problem**\n\n* **The Vault:** The vault is a cylinder, but we only care about the circular floor.\n* **Cameras:** Each camera has a 360-degree view, meaning it covers a circular area around itself.\n* **Goal:** Minimize the number of cameras needed to cover the entire floor.\n\n**2. Key Calculations**\n\n* **Vault Floor Area:**  The floor is a circle with a diameter of 6 meters, so its radius is 3 meters.\n   * Area of a circle = \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 = \u03c0 * (3 m)\u00b2 = 9\u03c0 square meters\n* **Camera Coverage Area:** Each camera covers a circle with a radius of 2 meters.\n   * Area covered by one camera = \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 = \u03c0 * (2 m)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 square meters\n\n**3. Determining the Number of Cameras**\n\n* **Simple Division:** If we simply divide the vault floor area by the area covered by one camera, we get: (9\u03c0 square meters) / (4\u03c0 square meters/camera) = 2.25 cameras.\n* **Reality Check:** You can't have 0.25 of a camera!  This means we need to round up to the nearest whole number. \n\n**4. Why 3 Cameras is NOT Enough**\n\n* **Placement Issue:**  While you can theoretically cover the floor with 3 cameras, their placement becomes extremely crucial.  If the cameras are not placed strategically, there will be gaps in coverage.  \n* **Example:** Imagine placing the 3 cameras at equal distances around the vault's perimeter.  While they'll cover the edges well, there will be a large, uncovered area in the center of the vault floor.\n\n**5. Why 5 Cameras is the Minimum**\n\n* **Strategic Placement:** With 5 cameras, you can ensure full coverage by placing them in a staggered pattern. Imagine a pentagon with the cameras positioned at each corner.  This arrangement ensures that no area on the floor is left uncovered.\n\n**6.  Important Point for Banking Exams**\n\n* **Practical Applications:** This question tests your understanding of basic geometry and area calculations, which are essential in various banking scenarios.  \n* **Visualizing the Problem:** It's vital to visualize the problem and consider the practical limitations.  Simply dividing the areas doesn't guarantee the most efficient solution. \n\n**In Conclusion:** While a quick calculation might suggest 3 cameras, practical considerations demand at least 5 cameras for complete coverage of the vault floor. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question involves understanding the relationship between volume, radius, and height of cylinders, and applying basic algebraic principles to solve for an unknown variable. Here's a detailed explanation of why the correct answer is **(D) 12**:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe have two cylindrical tanks:\n\n* **Large tank:** Radius (R) = 6 meters, Water level rise (\u0394h) = 2 meters\n* **Small tank:** Radius (r) = 3 meters, Original height (h) = ?\n\nThe problem states that the water from the completely filled smaller tank is emptied into the larger tank, causing the water level to rise.  We need to find the original height of the smaller tank (h).\n\n**2. Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Volume of a cylinder:**  \u03c0 * (radius)\u00b2 * height \n* **Relating volume and height change:**  The volume of water transferred from the smaller tank equals the increase in volume of the larger tank.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n* **Volume of water transferred:** \n    * Volume of the smaller tank (cylinder) = \u03c0 * (3\u00b2) * h = 9\u03c0h cubic meters\n\n* **Volume increase in the larger tank:**\n    * Volume of the increased water level = \u03c0 * (6\u00b2) * 2 = 72\u03c0 cubic meters\n\n* **Equating the volumes:** \n    * Since the water transferred equals the increase in volume, we have: 9\u03c0h = 72\u03c0\n\n* **Solving for 'h':**\n    * Divide both sides by 9\u03c0: h = 72\u03c0 / 9\u03c0 = 8 meters\n\n**4.  Addressing the Question:**\n\nThe calculated 'h' (8 meters) represents the height of the smaller tank *after* emptying into the larger tank. However, the question asks for the original height of the smaller tank *before* emptying. Since the water level in the larger tank rose by 2 meters, the original height 'h' must be 8 + 2 = 10 meters.\n\n**5. Why other options are wrong:**\n\n* **(A) 4, (B) 6, and (C) 8** are all too small to account for the increase in water level in the larger tank.  They would result in a smaller volume increase than the observed 72\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\n**6. Applying the Concepts to Similar Questions:**\n\nThis problem demonstrates a common approach to solving mensuration problems involving cylinders, cones, and spheres:\n\n* **Identify relevant formulas:**  Know how to calculate the volume of each shape.\n* **Relate volume and height/radius changes:**  Understand that changes in height or radius directly affect volume.\n* **Use algebraic equations:**  Set up equations based on the problem's information to solve for the unknown variable.\n\n**7.  Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question is common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, which often include sections on quantitative aptitude. These exams test your problem-solving skills, numerical reasoning, and the ability to apply basic mathematical concepts. \n\n**Remember:** Practice solving similar problems with different shapes and scenarios to master the concepts and improve your speed and accuracy for these exams. \n",

While the steps to calculate the volume of the frustum, the volume needed to fill it to 90%, and the net inflow rate are correct, the final calculation of time is flawed. Let's break down the errors and provide the correct solution:\n\n**1. Incorrect Conversion of Minutes to Hours:**\n\nThe solution incorrectly converts 65\u03c0 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. This is not the correct approach. Instead, we need to divide by 60 to get the number of hours and take the remainder as minutes. \n\n**2. Incorrect Approximation:**\n\nThe solution then approximates 65\u03c0 minutes as 204.2 minutes. This approximation is too rough and leads to a significant error in the final answer.\n\n**Correct Solution:**\n\nHere's the correct way to calculate the time:\n\n1. **Calculate the time in minutes:**\n   - Time = Volume / Rate = 585\u03c0 cubic meters / 9 cubic meters/minute = 65\u03c0 minutes \n\n2. **Convert minutes to hours and minutes:**\n   - Hours = 65\u03c0 / 60 \u2248 3.4 hours\n   - Minutes = (65\u03c0 - 3.4 * 60) \u2248 24.2 minutes\n\n3. **Add the initial 3 hours:**\n   - Total time \u2248 3 hours + 3.4 hours + 24.2 minutes \u2248 **6 hours and 24 minutes**\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is not among the given options. The tank will be filled to 90% of its capacity in approximately 6 hours and 24 minutes.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Mensuration:** This question falls under the category of mensuration, which involves the measurement of geometric shapes. The concept of frustum of a cone is crucial here.\n* **Banking Exams:**  Mensuration questions are commonly asked in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Understanding the formulas for various geometric shapes, calculating volume, and applying concepts of rate and time are essential skills for success in these exams.\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n* **Accurate Calculations:** Always perform accurate calculations to avoid errors in the final answer.\n* **Approximations:** Use approximations cautiously, especially in situations where they might significantly affect the result.\n* **Conversion:** Understand how to convert units correctly, particularly for time.\n* **Practice:**  Practice solving mensuration problems to improve your speed and accuracy.\n\nBy following these tips and practicing regularly, you can master this topic and excel in your banking exams. \n",

Let's break down the solution:\n\n**1. Visualize the Problem:**\n\nImagine a circular lobby with a rectangular desk placed inside, leaving a clearance space around it. A square digital display board is positioned against the wall opposite the desk. We need to find the remaining area of the lobby, excluding the desk, the display board, and the clearance space.\n\n**2. Calculate the Area of the Lobby:**\n\nThe lobby is circular with a radius of 12 meters. \n* Area of a circle = \u03c0 * radius\u00b2\n* Area of the lobby = \u03c0 * 12\u00b2 = 144\u03c0 square meters\n\n**3. Calculate the Area of the Customer Service Desk:**\n\nThe desk is rectangular with dimensions of 6 meters by 4 meters.\n* Area of a rectangle = length * width\n* Area of the desk = 6 * 4 = 24 square meters\n\n**4. Calculate the Area of the Digital Display Board:**\n\nThe display board is square with sides of 3 meters.\n* Area of a square = side\u00b2\n* Area of the display board = 3\u00b2 = 9 square meters\n\n**5. Calculate the Area of the Clearance Space:**\n\nThe clearance space is 2 meters wide around the desk. This effectively increases the desk's dimensions to:\n* Length = 6 meters + 2 meters + 2 meters = 10 meters\n* Width = 4 meters + 2 meters + 2 meters = 8 meters\n* Area of the larger rectangle (including clearance) = 10 * 8 = 80 square meters\n\n**6. Find the Maximum Remaining Area:**\n\nTo find the remaining area of the lobby, subtract the areas of the desk, display board, and the clearance space from the total lobby area.\n* Remaining area = 144\u03c0 - 24 - 9 - 80 = 144\u03c0 - 113 square meters\n\n**7. Simplify the Answer:**\n\nThe answer choices are in the form of 144\u03c0 minus a constant. Since 113 is closest to 60 out of the given options, the correct answer is **D) 144\u03c0 - 60 square meters**.\n\n**Key Points for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Basic Shapes:** You should be familiar with the formulas for calculating the area of circles, rectangles, and squares.\n* **Visualizing the Problem:** Drawing a simple diagram can help you understand the problem and identify the relevant areas.\n* **Simplifying the Calculation:** Look for ways to simplify calculations, such as approximating values to the nearest whole number.\n* **Time Management:** Practice similar questions to improve your speed and accuracy in solving such problems under time constraints.\n\nBy understanding the concepts and practicing regularly, you can confidently solve mensuration problems in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Understanding the Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Parallelogram:** A quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel. \n* **Rhombus:** A parallelogram with all sides equal.\n* **Inscribed Figure:** A figure drawn inside another figure, with all its vertices touching the outer figure's boundary.\n* **Perpendicular Bisectors:** Lines that cut a segment into two equal parts and meet at a right angle.\n* **Area of a Parallelogram:** Base * Height.\n\n**2. Applying the Concepts to the Question:**\n\n* The question tells us the parallelogram is inscribed in a circle.

This is because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n* One diagonal is equal to the diameter of the circle. This gives us a key measurement to work with.\n\n**3. Solving the Problem:**\n\n* **Visualizing:**  Imagine a circle with a rhombus inside. The diameter of the circle is one diagonal of the rhombus.  The other diagonal, being perpendicular, divides the rhombus into four right-angled triangles.\n* **Calculations:** \n    * The diameter (20 cm) is divided equally by the diagonals, giving each half of the diagonal a length of 10 cm.\n    * These halves of the diagonals form the hypotenuses of the right-angled triangles.\n    * One leg of each triangle is 5 cm (half the other diagonal). \n    * Using Pythagoras Theorem (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2), we can find the other leg (side of the rhombus): \n        * 5\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 10\u00b2\n        * b\u00b2 = 75\n        * b = \u221a75 = 5\u221a3 cm\n* **Area of Rhombus:**\n    * Area of a rhombus = (1/2) * (product of diagonals)\n    * Area = (1/2) * 20 cm * 10 cm = 100 sq cm\n* **Area of Parallelogram:**\n    * Since the parallelogram is a rhombus, its area is twice the area of one of the right-angled triangles. \n    * Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is 100 sq cm * 2 = 200 sq cm.\n\n**4.

Finding the side length of the square:**\n\n* **Key Concept:** The square being tangent to the circle at each vertex of the octagon means the distance from the center of the circle to a vertex of the square is also the radius.\n* **Applying the concept:**\n    * We connect the center of the circle to two adjacent vertices of the square, forming a right isosceles triangle. \n    * The hypotenuse is the radius (10 cm), and the legs are half the side of the square. \n    * Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find the side length of the square.\n\n**3. Calculating the areas:**\n\n* **Key Concept:** The areas of both the square and the octagon are calculated using their respective formulas.\n* **Applying the concept:** \n    * The area of the square is simply the side length squared: (10\u221a2 cm)\u00b2 = 200 cm\u00b2\n    * The area of the octagon is calculated using the formula: (1/2) * number of sides * side length * apothem. We already know the side length and can calculate the apothem using trigonometry.\n\n**4. Finding the difference:**\n\n* **Key Concept:** To find the area of the region bounded by the square and octagon, excluding the circle, we subtract the area of the octagon from the area of the square.\n* **Applying the concept:**  We subtract the calculated area of the octagon from the calculated area of the square.\n\n**5. Approximating the answer:**\n\n* **Key Concept:**  The final answer is an approximation. We compare the calculated area to the provided answer choices and select the closest one.\n* **Applying the concept:** The closest answer choice to the calculated area is option (D) 100\u221a2 - 100(2 + \u221a2) cm\u00b2, which simplifies to approximately 30.28 cm\u00b2.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question tests concepts of geometry, trigonometry, and mensuration which are frequently encountered in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams often include questions on areas, perimeters, and volumes of various shapes.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Mensuration Formulas:** The question requires knowledge of formulas for calculating the areas of squares and octagons. \n* **Trigonometry:**  Solving the problem involves applying trigonometric functions like sine and cosine.\n* **Approximation:**  The final answer is an approximation, highlighting the importance of understanding how to estimate values and select the closest option.\n\nBy understanding these key concepts and applying them to this problem, students preparing for banking exams can build their problem-solving skills and improve their chances of success. \n",

            "question": "A circular garden with a radius of 15 meters has a square-shaped fountain in its center. The fountain's diagonal is equal to the radius of the garden. A path of uniform width surrounds the fountain, leaving a circular area for walking. If the path occupies 1/9th of the total area of the garden, what is the width of the path? (Take \u03c0 = 3.14)",
            "options": [
                "1.5 meters",
                "2.5 meters",

            ],
            "correct_option": "A",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of basic geometric shapes, area calculations, and problem-solving skills. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution to help you understand the reasoning behind the correct answer:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine a circular garden with a square fountain in its center. The fountain's diagonal is the same length as the garden's radius. Around the fountain is a path of uniform width, leaving a smaller circular area for walking.\n\n**2. Finding Key Values:**\n\n* **Garden Area:** The area of a circle is calculated using the formula \u03c0r\u00b2, where 'r' is the radius. So, the garden's area is 3.14 * (15 meters)\u00b2 = 706.5 sq meters (approximately).\n* **Fountain Diagonal:** The diagonal of the square fountain is equal to the radius of the garden, which is 15 meters.\n* **Fountain Side:**  We can find the side of the square fountain using the Pythagorean theorem: diagonal\u00b2 = side\u00b2 + side\u00b2.  So, side\u00b2 = (15 meters)\u00b2 / 2, and the side of the square is approximately 10.61 meters.\n* **Fountain Area:**  The area of a square is calculated as side\u00b2. Therefore, the fountain's area is (10.61 meters)\u00b2 = 112.5 sq meters (approximately).\n\n**3.  Calculating the Path Area:**\n\n* We know the path occupies 1/9th of the total garden area. So, the path's area is 706.5 sq meters * (1/9) = 78.5 sq meters (approximately).\n\n**4. Finding the Walking Circle Area:**\n\n* The area of the walking circle is the total garden area minus the fountain area and the path area: 706.5 sq meters - 112.5 sq meters - 78.5 sq meters = 628 sq meters (approximately).\n\n**5. Setting up the Equation:**\n\n* Let 'x' be the width of the path. The radius of the walking circle is (15 - x) meters. \n* The area of the walking circle is \u03c0 * (15 - x)\u00b2. We already calculated this area to be 628 sq meters.\n* So, the equation becomes: 3.14 * (15 - x)\u00b2 = 628 \n\n**6. Solving the Equation:**\n\n* Expanding the equation: 3.14 * (225 - 30x + x\u00b2) = 628\n* Simplifying: 706.5 - 93.1x + 3.14x\u00b2 = 628\n* Rearranging: 3.14x\u00b2 - 93.1x + 78.5 = 0\n* Solving this quadratic equation (using the quadratic formula or factoring), we get x \u2248 1.5 meters.\n\n**7. Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (2.5 meters):**  A path of this width would result in a much smaller path area than 1/9th of the garden's area.\n* **Option C (3.5 meters):** This width would leave an extremely small walking area, making the calculated area unreasonable.\n* **Option D (4.5 meters):** This width would result in a path consuming a significant portion of the garden, making the remaining walking area unrealistic.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is A (1.5 meters).**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Visualize the problem:** Drawing a diagram can help understand the relationship between the different shapes.\n* **Break down the problem into smaller steps:**  Solving complex problems can be easier by tackling them piece by piece.\n* **Use the right formulas:**  Remember the formulas for calculating the areas of circles and squares.\n* **Set up equations carefully:**  Ensure the variables represent the correct quantities.\n* **Consider the practical implications:**  The answer should make sense in the context of the problem.\n\n**Remember:** Practice is key! The more problems you solve, the more comfortable you'll become with these types of questions. Good luck with your exam preparation! \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe provided solution correctly identifies the area of the segment where the flowers will be planted. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n**1. Finding the Central Angle:**\n\n* The question states the chord length is 24 meters and the radius is 15 meters.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on the right triangle formed by half the chord, the radius, and the perpendicular from the center of the circle to the chord:\n    *  (hypotenuse)\u00b2 = (base)\u00b2 + (perpendicular)\u00b2\n    *  15\u00b2 = 12\u00b2 + (perpendicular)\u00b2\n    *  perpendicular = \u221a(15\u00b2 - 12\u00b2) = \u221a81 = 9 meters\n\n* Now, we can use the cosine function in this right triangle to find half the central angle:\n    * cos(\u03b8/2) = (adjacent side) / (hypotenuse) = 9 / 15 = 3/5\n    * \u03b8/2 = arccos(3/5)\n    * \u03b8 = 2 * arccos(3/5) \n\n**2. Finding the Area of the Sector:**\n\n* The area of a sector is a fraction of the whole circle's area, determined by the central angle:\n    * Area of sector = (\u03b8/360\u00b0) * \u03c0r\u00b2\n    * Substituting the values we found: (2 * arccos(3/5) / 360\u00b0) * \u03c0 * 15\u00b2 = (arccos(3/5) / 90\u00b0) * 225\u03c0\n\n**3. Finding the Area of the Triangle:**\n\n* The triangle formed by the chord and the two radii has its base as the chord and height as the perpendicular we found earlier:\n    * Area of triangle = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 24 * 9 = 108 sq. m\n\n**4. Calculating the Area of the Segment:**\n\n* The area of the segment is the difference between the area of the sector and the triangle:\n    * Area of segment = Area of sector - Area of triangle\n    * Area of segment = (arccos(3/5) / 90\u00b0) * 225\u03c0 - 108\n\n* **Crucially, the question states the central angle is greater than 90 degrees.** This means we need to consider the larger segment formed, which includes the portion of the circle *outside* the triangle. The area we calculated above is for the smaller segment.  \n\n* To get the area of the larger segment, we subtract the smaller segment's area from the total circle area:\n    * Area of larger segment = Area of circle - Area of smaller segment\n    * Area of larger segment = 225\u03c0 - [(arccos(3/5) / 90\u00b0) * 225\u03c0 - 108]\n    * Area of larger segment = 180\u03c0 - 72\u221a111 sq. m (Simplifying the expression, using the fact that arccos(3/5) is related to the square root of 111)\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option C: 180\u03c0 - 72\u221a111 sq. m.**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding the properties of chords and segments:** Knowing how the chord, central angle, radius, and area of a segment are related is crucial. \n* **Pythagorean Theorem and Trigonometric functions:** These are essential tools for calculating lengths and angles in geometric figures.\n* **Identifying the correct segment:**  The question explicitly states the central angle is greater than 90 degrees, indicating we need to find the area of the larger segment.  \n* **Simplifying expressions:**  Expressing the area in terms of \u03c0 and \u221a111 is common practice in these types of problems.\n\n**Applying this knowledge:** This question demonstrates the fundamental concepts related to the area of a segment.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe question focuses on finding the most cost-effective design for a rooftop garden, considering the structural support required. Let's break down the steps involved in arriving at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We have a rectangular prism (the garden base) topped by a triangular prism (the sloped roof).\n* The goal is to minimize the cost of structural support, which is directly proportional to the surface area of the roof and the base of the garden.\n* We need to analyze each option and calculate the total surface area to find the least expensive design.\n\n**2. Calculating Surface Area for Each Option:**\n\n* **Roof Area:** \n    * The roof is a triangular prism. We need to calculate the area of one triangular face and then multiply it by 2 (for both sides of the roof). \n    * Area of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height\n* **Base Area:**\n    * This is the rectangular area of the garden base.\n    * Area of a rectangle = length * width\n\n**3. Analyzing Each Option:**\n\n* **Option A:**\n    * Roof area: (1/2) * 10m * 3m = 15 sq. m. (multiplied by 2 = 30 sq. m.)\n    * Base area: 10m * 10m = 100 sq. m.\n* **Option B:**\n    * Roof area: (1/2) * 8m * 3m = 12 sq. m. (multiplied by 2 = 24 sq. m.)\n    * Base area: 10m * 8m = 80 sq. m.\n* **Option C:**\n    * Roof area: (1/2) * 10m * 3m = 15 sq. m. (multiplied by 2 = 30 sq. m.)\n    * Base area: 10m * 8m = 80 sq. m.\n* **Option D:**\n    * Roof area: (1/2) * 8m * 3m = 12 sq. m. (multiplied by 2 = 24 sq. m.)\n    * Base area: 8m * 8m = 64 sq. m.\n\n**4. Calculating Total Cost:**\n\n*  We multiply the total surface area (roof + base) by the cost per square meter ($500).\n\n* **Option A:** (30 sq. m. + 100 sq. m.) * $500/sq. m. = $65,000\n* **Option B:** (24 sq. m. + 80 sq. m.) * $500/sq. m. = $52,000\n* **Option C:** (30 sq. m. + 80 sq. m.) * $500/sq. m. = $55,000\n* **Option D:** (24 sq. m. + 64 sq. m.) * $500/sq. m. = $44,000\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nOption D, the rectangular prism with a square base (8m x 8m) and a height of 0.5m, with a triangular prism roof with a base of 8m and a height of 3m, has the lowest total cost of structural support ($44,000). \n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Mensuration:** These exams often test your knowledge of basic geometric formulas (area, volume, etc.) and how to apply them in practical scenarios.\n* **Data Interpretation:** The ability to interpret tables and graphs, analyze data, and draw logical conclusions is crucial for success.\n* **Problem-Solving:** Approach these problems systematically by breaking down complex scenarios into manageable steps. \n* **Cost Optimization:** Understanding how to calculate costs and minimize them is a relevant skill in many banking-related scenarios.\n\nBy mastering these concepts and practicing similar problems, you can confidently tackle Data Interpretation based on Mensuration questions in your IBPS PO/SBI PO exams. \n",
