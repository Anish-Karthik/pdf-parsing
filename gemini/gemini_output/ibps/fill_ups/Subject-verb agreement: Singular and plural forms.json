Here's why:\n\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The fundamental rule in English grammar is that the verb in a sentence must agree with its subject in number.  This means that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb.\n* **Identifying the Subject:** In the sentence \"One of the apples _____ already eaten,\" the subject is \"one\". This is because the phrase \"of the apples\" acts as a modifier, describing the specific \"one\" apple being referred to.\n* **Singular Subject, Singular Verb:**  \"One\" is a singular noun. Therefore, the verb must also be singular.  The singular form of the verb \"to be\" in the present tense is \"is\". \n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    * **B) are:** This is the plural form of the verb \"to be,\" and it doesn't agree with the singular subject \"one.\"\n    * **C) has:** This is the singular form of the verb \"to have,\" which is not appropriate in this context because the sentence is describing a state of being, not possession.\n    * **D) have:** This is the plural form of the verb \"to have,\" and it doesn't agree with the singular subject \"one.\"\n\n**Key Takeaway:** When dealing with phrases like \"one of the...\" in subject-verb agreement questions, focus on identifying the actual subject, which is usually \"one,\" and use the singular form of the verb accordingly. \n",

Here's why:\n\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The fundamental principle of subject-verb agreement dictates that the verb in a sentence must agree in number (singular or plural) with its subject.\n* **Singular Subject:** The subject of the sentence is \"The Hobbit\".  While it refers to a book, it is treated as a singular noun because it is a single title.  Think of it like this:  \"The Hobbit\" is the name of one specific book, not multiple books. \n* **Present Tense:** The sentence is in the present tense, indicating that the book remains a beloved children's fantasy novel even today. This eliminates options \"c) was\" and \"d) were\" which are in the past tense.\n* **\"Is\" vs. \"Are\":**  Since the subject is singular, the correct verb is \"is\", eliminating option \"b) are\", which is the plural form of the verb \"to be\".\n\n**In simpler terms:**  \"The Hobbit\" is one book, so we need a singular verb.  \"Is\" is the singular form of the verb \"to be\" in the present tense.\n\n**Key takeaway for similar questions:**\n\n* **Focus on the subject:** Identify the subject of the sentence and determine if it is singular or plural. \n* **Choose the correct verb form:** The verb must agree with the subject in number.\n* **Consider the tense:**  Make sure the verb is in the correct tense based on the context of the sentence.\n\n**Additional context:**\n\nSubject-Verb Agreement with Titles of Books and Works is a common topic in English grammar.  Many titles, even if they appear plural, are treated as singular entities. This principle applies not only to book titles, but also to movie titles, album titles, and other works of art.  \n\nFor example:\n\n* \"The Hunger Games\" is a popular book series. (Singular subject, singular verb)\n* \"The Avengers\" is a successful movie franchise. (Singular subject, singular verb)\n\n**This understanding of subject-verb agreement is crucial for success in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, which often test English grammar skills.** \n",

Subject-Verb Agreement:**\n\nThe verb in the sentence needs to agree with the subject in number (singular or plural). Since the subject \"team\" is plural, the verb must also be plural.  \n\n**4. Analyzing the Options:**\n\n* **a) is** - This is a singular verb. It does not agree with the plural subject.\n* **b) are** - This is the **correct** plural verb form, agreeing with the plural subject \"team\".\n* **c) was** - This is a singular verb in the past tense.

They refer to a single entity, even if they seem to refer to a group.\n* **Correct Verb Form:** Since \"neither\" is singular, the verb needs to be singular as well. The correct singular form of the verb \"to meet\" in the present tense is \"meets.\" \n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(b) meet:** This is a plural form of the verb, which does not agree with the singular subject \"neither.\"\n* **(c) has met:** This uses the past perfect tense, which isn't appropriate in the context of the sentence. \n* **(d) have met:**  This is again a plural verb, not matching the singular subject \"neither.\"\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  \n\nFor exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, mastering subject-verb agreement is crucial. Pay close attention to indefinite pronouns. Remember that they are always singular, even if they seem to represent multiple things.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **More Examples:**\n    * Neither **of the applicants** **is** qualified for the job. \n    * Each **of the candidates** **has** submitted their application.\n* **Common Mistakes:**  A common mistake is to assume that because \"neither\" refers to \"two proposals,\" it should take a plural verb. However, \"neither\" itself acts as a single unit, and therefore the verb must agree with it. \n* **Practice:** To strengthen your understanding, practice identifying singular and plural indefinite pronouns and then choose the correct verb form to match. You can find plenty of practice questions in textbooks and online resources. \n",

This means if the subject is singular, the verb must be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural.\n* **\"A plethora of\" as a Singular Unit:** In the sentence, the subject is \"a plethora of opportunities.\"  While \"opportunities\" itself is plural, the phrase \"a plethora of\" acts as a collective noun, signifying a large quantity of something. This entire phrase is considered singular, hence requiring a singular verb. \n* **\"Is\" as the Correct Verb:** Since the subject (\"a plethora of opportunities\") is singular, the verb must also be singular.  \"Is\" is the correct singular present tense verb.\n\n**Here are some additional points to remember:**\n\n* **\"There\" and \"Here\" as Introductory Words:**  In sentences starting with \"there\" or \"here,\" the true subject usually follows the verb. For example, \"There are many opportunities\" (subject: opportunities).\n* **Collective Nouns:** These nouns represent a group of individuals or things (e.g., team, family, flock). They can be singular or plural depending on the context. If the noun is acting as a single unit, it takes a singular verb.  If it refers to individual members, it takes a plural verb.\n\n**Example:** \n* \"The team is playing well.\" (The team is acting as a single unit.)\n* \"The team members are having lunch.\" (The focus is on individual members.)\n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\nFor IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, understanding Subject-Verb Agreement is crucial.  Remember these key points: \n\n* **Identify the subject.**\n* **Determine whether the subject is singular or plural.**\n* **Choose the correct verb form to match the subject.**\n\nBy practicing this concept, you can confidently answer similar questions on the exams. \n",

Even though the phrase includes the word \"team\", which is singular, the actual subject is \"engineers,\" which is a plural noun.  This is because \"team\" is a collective noun, referring to a group of individuals.\n\n3. **Choosing the Correct Verb:**  Since the subject is plural (\"engineers\"), we need a plural verb. Of the options provided:\n    * \"is\" and \"has\" are singular verbs.\n    * \"are\" and \"have\" are plural verbs.\n\n4. **Tense Consideration:** The sentence is in the present continuous tense, which uses the present participle of the verb (working) along with the auxiliary verb \"be\" or \"have\". Since the subject is plural, the correct auxiliary verb is \"are\" (plural form of \"to be\").\n\n**In summary:** The sentence requires a plural verb to agree with the plural subject \"engineers,\" and the present continuous tense necessitates the use of \"are\" as the auxiliary verb. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Collective Nouns:**  Collective nouns can be tricky as they refer to groups but are often treated as singular.  However, when the collective noun is emphasizing the individual members of the group, it takes a plural verb.

The phrase \"nestled amongst the vibrant blooms\" describes the location of the orchid, not the subject itself. \n* **Singular Verb:**  Since the subject is singular, the correct verb form is \"is\".

These questions often use tricky sentence structures, making it important to identify the true subject accurately. In this case, identifying the subject as \"a rare species of orchid\" is crucial for choosing the correct verb form.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThe question focuses on a common error in subject-verb agreement involving the words \"here\" and \"there\".

            "correct_option": "A",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **(A) 'did'**. Here's why:\n\n**1. Inverted Sentence Structure:**\n\nThe sentence is in an inverted structure, meaning the usual subject-verb order is reversed.  Instead of \"The explorers finally reached...\", we have \"Only after... did the explorers finally reach...\". This inversion is often used for emphasis or stylistic reasons.\n\n**2. Subject-Verb Agreement:**\n\n* **Subject:** The subject of the sentence is \"explorers\", which is a plural noun. \n* **Verb:** The verb must agree with the subject in number and tense.  \n* **Past Tense:**  The sentence describes a completed action in the past (the explorers reached the civilization). This means we need a past tense verb.\n\n**3. 'Did' as the Correct Verb:**\n\n* **'Did' is the past tense of the auxiliary verb 'do'.**  It is used to form questions and negatives in simple past tense. \n* **In this case, 'did' acts as a helping verb.** It helps to create the inverted sentence structure and emphasizes the past tense.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **'Do' is the present tense of the auxiliary verb 'do'.** It doesn't fit the past tense context of the sentence.\n* **'Has' and 'have' are present perfect tense verbs.** They imply an action that began in the past and continues to the present. The sentence indicates a completed action in the past.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nWhen dealing with inverted sentence structures, always focus on identifying the subject and the verb. The verb must agree with the subject in number and tense, even when the sentence order is reversed.\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Subject-verb agreement is a fundamental grammar concept frequently tested in these exams.**  \n* **Questions may involve various sentence structures, including inverted sentences.**\n* **Candidates must be comfortable identifying the subject and verb, even when they appear in unusual positions.** \n* **Understanding the different tenses and their correct usage is crucial.**\n\n**By mastering subject-verb agreement and recognizing inverted structures, candidates can confidently tackle grammar questions in the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams.** \n",

The verb in a sentence must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural).\n\n2. **Identifying the Subject:** The subject of this sentence is \"one,\" which is a singular pronoun. It refers to a single scientific breakthrough, even though the phrase \"numerous scientific breakthroughs\" precedes it. \n\n3. **Choosing the Correct Verb:** The verb in the sentence needs to be in the singular form to agree with the singular subject \"one.\"  \n\n4. **Tense:** The question asks about the impact of a breakthrough on \"our current knowledge,\" indicating that the impact is ongoing and has happened in the past. This requires the present perfect tense.\n\n5. **Analyzing the Options:**\n    * **(a) has had:** This is the correct option. The singular verb \"has\" agrees with the singular subject \"one,\" and the present perfect tense \"had\" accurately reflects the ongoing impact.\n    * **(b) have had:** This is incorrect because \"have\" is the plural form of the verb, and it doesn't agree with the singular subject \"one.\"\n    * **(c) has:** This is incorrect because while \"has\" agrees with \"one,\" it doesn't convey the ongoing nature of the impact. \n    * **(d) have:** This is incorrect for the same reason as (b), as \"have\" is plural.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe correct answer is \"has had\" because it correctly agrees with the singular subject \"one\" and accurately depicts the impact of a single breakthrough on our current understanding of the cosmos, using the present perfect tense. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of subject-verb agreement, which is a crucial grammar concept for any competitive exam. It's especially important in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, where you'll encounter numerous reading comprehension passages and questions that require a strong grasp of grammar. \n\n**Tips for Subject-Verb Agreement:**\n\n* Always identify the subject of the sentence first.\n* Determine if the subject is singular or plural.\n* Choose the verb that agrees with the subject in number. \n* Pay attention to words that come between the subject and the verb, as they can sometimes mislead you. \n\nMastering subject-verb agreement will help you answer similar questions confidently and accurately on your exams. \n",

While \"none\" can sometimes be singular, it is **plural in this case** because it refers to the plural noun \"designs\".  Think of it this way:  \"None of the designs\" means \"not one of the designs,\" implying multiple designs. \n\n3. **The Verb: 'Were'**  Since the subject \"none\" is plural, the verb needs to be plural as well.

Here's why:\n\n1. **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The fundamental principle in English grammar is that the verb in a sentence must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural). This means if the subject is singular, the verb should also be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb should be plural.\n\n2. **Identifying the Subject:**  In this sentence, the subjects are \"research\" and \"analysis\".  We need to focus on the core subjects, not the additional clauses.\n\n3. **'Neither...nor' Structure:** When using the conjunction \"neither...nor\", the verb agrees with the subject that is closer to it.  In this case, the subject closer to the verb is \"analysis\", which is singular. \n\n4. **Singular Verb:** Since the subject closer to the verb is singular (\"analysis\"), the verb must also be singular. Therefore, \"was\" is the correct choice as it is the singular past tense form of the verb \"to be\".\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement with 'Both...and' and 'Neither...nor':**\n    * **Both...and**: When using \"both...and\", the verb is always plural, as it refers to two or more things.\n    * **Neither...nor**: The verb agrees with the subject closest to it, which can be singular or plural depending on the context.\n\n* **Important Note:**  Pay close attention to the core subjects in complex sentences. Ignore any modifying clauses or phrases that might distract you from the true subject-verb agreement.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* **Incorrect:** Neither the research nor the analysis *were* able to provide a solution. (The verb \"were\" is plural, but the subjects are singular.)\n* **Correct:** Neither the research nor the analysis *was* able to provide a solution. (The verb \"was\" is singular, agreeing with the singular subject \"analysis\".)\n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\n* By understanding subject-verb agreement rules, especially with structures like \"neither...nor\", you can confidently tackle similar questions in your IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n* Practice identifying the subjects and the verbs in different sentence structures to solidify your grasp on this concept. \n",

The verb in a sentence must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural). In this sentence, the subject is \"one,\" which is a singular pronoun. \n* **Singular Pronoun 'One':**  The pronoun \"one\" is always considered singular, even when it refers to a general person. \n* **Present Tense:** The sentence describes a feeling that is happening in the present moment, immediately after the completion of the task.  Therefore, the present tense verb is the correct choice. \n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    * **(A) one is feeling:** This uses the present continuous tense, which implies an ongoing action. The sentence describes a feeling that happens immediately after the task, not an ongoing process.\n    * **(C) one has felt:** This uses the past perfect tense, indicating an action completed before another past action. The sentence doesn't convey that the feeling happened before a specific past event.\n    * **(D) one was feeling:** This uses the past continuous tense, suggesting an action happening over a period of time in the past. The sentence describes a feeling that happens right after the task is finished, not a feeling that was happening before.\n\n**Key takeaway:**  When dealing with subject-verb agreement, always ensure the verb agrees with the subject in number.  Also, pay attention to the tense of the verb and choose the tense that best reflects the context and the action described in the sentence.\n\n**For IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:** Understanding subject-verb agreement is crucial for the English Language section of these exams.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **(a) has**. Here's why:\n\n* **Collective Nouns:** The word \"jury\" is a collective noun. Collective nouns represent a group of individuals (in this case, the jury members) but are treated as singular when they act as a single unit.\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The verb in a sentence must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural).  Since \"jury\" is acting as a singular unit in this sentence, we need a singular verb.\n* **Singular Verb:** The singular verb \"has\" correctly agrees with the singular subject \"jury\". \n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(b) have:** This is the plural form of the verb \"to have\" and is incorrect because it doesn't agree with the singular subject \"jury\".\n* **(c) is:**  While \"is\" is singular, it doesn't fit the context of the sentence. The sentence is describing an action (reaching a verdict), which requires a verb form that denotes action.\n* **(d) are:** This is the plural form of the verb \"to be\" and is incorrect because it doesn't agree with the singular subject \"jury\".\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Collective Nouns and Context:** The grammatical treatment of collective nouns can sometimes depend on the context. If the sentence emphasizes the individual members of the group acting independently, a plural verb might be used. However, in this sentence, the focus is on the jury acting as a unified entity, making the singular verb \"has\" the correct choice. \n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\nUnderstanding how collective nouns function in subject-verb agreement is crucial for various competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's how you can apply this knowledge:\n\n1. **Identify the Collective Noun:** Look for words like team, committee, family, jury, group, etc.\n2. **Determine the Unit of Action:**  Consider whether the collective noun is acting as a single unit or whether the sentence focuses on the individual members.\n3. **Choose the Correct Verb:** If the collective noun is a single unit, use a singular verb. If the sentence emphasizes individual action, use a plural verb.\n\nBy practicing these steps, you'll be able to confidently handle subject-verb agreement questions with collective nouns in your banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **\"analysis\"** because it accurately reflects the grammatical structure and meaning of the sentence. Here's why:\n\n1. **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The sentence's subject is \"meticulous and painstaking **___**\" which modifies the noun \"**analysis**\". Since \"analysis\" is singular, the verb should also be singular.  \"Analysis\" is a singular noun, and the verb \"revealed\" is also singular, ensuring agreement.\n\n2. **Past Tense:** The sentence describes a completed action in the past (\"finally revealed\"). Therefore, the correct form of the verb \"analyze\" needs to be in the past tense.  \"Analysis\" is the noun form, and the past tense of \"analyze\" is \"analyzed\". \n\n3. **Eliminating Incorrect Options:**\n\n    * **\"analyses\"**: This is the plural form of \"analysis\", which doesn't fit the singular subject.\n    * **\"analyzing\"**: This is the present participle, which is used for ongoing actions. The sentence describes a completed action.\n    * **\"analyzed\"**: This is the past participle, which is used in different grammatical contexts like passive voice or perfect tenses. While it is correct grammatically, it doesn't fit the sentence structure and meaning.\n\n**In summary, \"analysis\" is the correct answer because it is singular, a noun form, and correctly reflects the past tense of the verb \"analyze\" as required by the sentence structure.**\n\n**Additional Context and Learning Tips:**\n\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement:**  Always ensure that the subject and verb agree in number (singular or plural). Subjects and verbs must match in number.  This is a fundamental grammatical rule that is frequently tested in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n* **Tense Consistency:** Maintaining consistency in verb tense is essential. Pay close attention to the context of the sentence to determine the appropriate tense. \n* **Understanding Noun Forms:** Be aware of the different forms of nouns: singular, plural, and their usage in various grammatical structures.\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n\n* **Identify the subject:** The first step in subject-verb agreement is to identify the subject of the sentence. \n* **Determine the number:** Is the subject singular or plural?\n* **Choose the correct verb form:** Make sure the verb agrees in number with the subject.\n* **Practice identifying different tenses:**  Pay attention to the context and choose the verb form that correctly reflects the tense.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing, you can confidently tackle similar questions on subject-verb agreement in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

In this sentence, the subject is \"**fact**\". \n* **Identifying the Subject:** The phrase \"with its focus on long-term growth and minimal risk\" modifies \"investment strategy\" and is not the subject of the sentence.  It's a descriptive phrase that adds information about the strategy, but doesn't change the subject.\n* **Singular Subject, Singular Verb:** Since \"fact\" is a singular noun, the verb must also be singular. \"Has\" is the singular form of the verb \"to have,\" making it the correct choice.\n\n**In simpler terms:**\n\nImagine the sentence without the extra details: \"The fact... has consistently outperformed the market.\"  The focus is clearly on the \"fact\", and not the investment strategy.\n\n**Additional Context and Learning Points:**\n\n* **\"This\" and \"That\" as Subjects:**  The words \"this\" and \"that\" are often used as subjects, and it's important to understand how they work. They act as pronouns, replacing a noun or noun phrase, and their number (singular or plural) depends on the noun they are referring to. For example: \n    * \"This investment strategy has... \" (singular)\n    * \"These investment strategies have... \" (plural)\n* **Subject-Verb Agreement in Complex Sentences:** Be cautious with complex sentences with multiple clauses or phrases.

Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses and act as the subject or object within that clause.\n\n2. **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The relative clause is \"many of [blank] have earned prestigious awards...\".

Understanding the Sentence Structure:**\n\nThe sentence consists of two independent clauses:\n\n* **Clause 1:** \"A significant number of the investors, many of whom have been closely following the company's progress, **____** eager to see the latest financial report...\"\n* **Clause 2:** \"...even though a few **____** still hesitant to commit further capital due to recent market fluctuations.\"\n\n**2. Identifying the Subjects:**\n\n* **Clause 1:** The subject is \"many of whom.\" Although the sentence starts with \"A significant number of the investors,\" the phrase \"many of whom\" functions as the subject of this clause. It refers to a plural group of investors within the larger group.\n* **Clause 2:** The subject is \"a few.\"  This refers to a smaller, specific group within the investors. \n\n**3. Applying Subject-Verb Agreement:**\n\n* **Clause 1:**  Since the subject \"many of whom\" is plural, the verb needs to be plural as well. Therefore, \"are\" is the correct choice.\n* **Clause 2:** The subject \"a few\" is also plural, but the context suggests we're talking about a small, specific group.  This is treated as singular in this context. Hence, \"is\" is the correct verb form.\n\n**4. Combining the Clauses:**\n\nThe correct answer is **(c) are / is** because it correctly applies the subject-verb agreement rules to both clauses.\n\n**Key Points for Subject-Verb Agreement with 'Many' and 'Few':**\n\n* **\"Many\" and \"Few\" are usually plural:**  When used as subjects, they generally require a plural verb. \n* **Context is important:**  Sometimes, \"a few\" can be treated as singular if it refers to a small, specific group. This is often the case when referring to individuals or items as a unit. \n\n**Additional Tips for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Practice Regularly:**  Subject-verb agreement questions are common in banking exams.  Practice with various sentence structures and different forms of \"many\" and \"few.\"\n* **Understand Pronoun Agreement:**  Pay attention to pronouns that relate to the subject.  Make sure they agree in number and person.\n* **Identify the True Subject:** Sometimes, the subject is hidden within a long phrase or clause.  Carefully identify the true subject before choosing the verb.\n\nBy mastering these concepts and practicing regularly, you can confidently answer subject-verb agreement questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",
