            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **B) Cross-Entropy Loss**. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Loss Functions**\n\nLoss functions are essential components of machine learning models. They quantify how well a model performs on a given task. By minimizing the loss function, we aim to improve the model's accuracy.\n\n**Binary Classification and Cross-Entropy Loss**\n\nBinary classification deals with predicting one of two possible outcomes (e.g., whether a loan application will be approved or rejected).  Cross-Entropy Loss is particularly suitable for such tasks due to its ability to handle probabilities.\n\n**How Cross-Entropy Loss Works:**\n\n* **Probabilities:** In binary classification, the model outputs a probability score between 0 and 1 for each class.  \n* **Comparison:** Cross-entropy loss compares these predicted probabilities to the actual class labels (0 or 1).\n* **Penalty:** It penalizes the model more severely for making incorrect predictions with high confidence. \n* **Optimization:** By minimizing the cross-entropy loss, the model learns to assign higher probabilities to the correct class and lower probabilities to the incorrect class.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A) Mean Squared Error (MSE):**  MSE is generally used for regression tasks (predicting continuous values) where the error is measured as the squared difference between predicted and actual values.\n* **C) Hinge Loss:**  Hinge Loss is primarily used for Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which focus on finding the optimal separating hyperplane between classes.\n* **D) Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** MAE is another regression-based loss function that measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO exams:**\n\nThese banking exams often test understanding of basic machine learning concepts like loss functions. Being familiar with Cross-Entropy Loss and its relevance in binary classification problems is crucial. The ability to differentiate between different loss functions based on their applications is a valuable skill for any aspiring banking professional.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say we have a model that predicts the probability of loan approval:\n\n* **Actual Class:** Loan Approved (1)\n* **Predicted Probability:** 0.8\n\nCross-entropy loss would penalize the model for not predicting a probability closer to 1 (the actual class).  In contrast, if the model predicted a probability of 0.2, the penalty would be much higher due to the greater discrepancy between prediction and reality. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **\"D. A strong local economy with growing job opportunities\"**. Here's why:\n\n* **Property value is driven by supply and demand.** When demand for housing is high, prices tend to increase. A strong local economy with growing job opportunities directly contributes to this increased demand. \n* **Growing job opportunities attract more people to the area.**  This increase in population leads to a higher demand for housing, putting upward pressure on prices.\n* **A strong economy means people have more disposable income.** This enables them to afford higher-priced properties, further fueling demand.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A. A decrease in the local population:**  A shrinking population would lead to less demand for housing, ultimately lowering property values.\n* **B. A rise in interest rates for mortgages:** Higher interest rates make borrowing money more expensive, making it harder for people to afford homes. This would likely result in lower demand and a decrease in property value.\n* **C. An increase in the number of similar properties being built in the area:** An oversupply of properties in a particular area leads to increased competition among sellers, driving down prices. \n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding the factors influencing property appreciation is crucial for these banking exams, as they often test your knowledge of the real estate market. These exams may include questions on:\n\n* **Loan products:** Understanding the impact of interest rate fluctuations on mortgage affordability.\n* **Economic trends:** Evaluating how macroeconomic factors like employment growth and inflation influence real estate markets.\n* **Investment strategies:**  Identifying the potential for property investment based on market conditions.\n\n**Key takeaway:**\n\nA strong local economy with growing job opportunities is the most significant factor that leads to property appreciation. Remember, it's all about the interplay of supply and demand, and anything that increases demand while keeping supply relatively constant will likely drive up property values. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question deals with the concept of **Marked Price (MP)** and **Discount**. This is a common topic in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Marked Price (MP):** This is the price at which an item is displayed for sale. In this case, the MP of the shoes is Rs. 1500.\n\n2. **Discount:** This is a reduction offered on the MP. The shopkeeper offers a 20% discount on the MP.\n\n3. **Calculating the Discount:** To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of the MP: \n   * Discount = (20/100) * 1500 = Rs. 300\n\n4. **Selling Price (SP):** This is the final price at which the item is sold. It is calculated by subtracting the discount from the MP:\n   * SP = MP - Discount\n   * SP = 1500 - 300 = Rs. 1200\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is A (Rs. 1200).**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding the terms:** It's crucial to understand the difference between MP, SP, and Discount.\n* **Calculating Discount:** Discount is always calculated on the MP.\n* **Formula for SP:** SP = MP - Discount\n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\nThis concept is widely used in banking exams. You can apply this understanding to solve various questions involving discounts, profit, loss, and other related topics. For example, you might see questions where you need to calculate the discount percentage given the MP and SP, or calculate the profit percentage when the shopkeeper buys the shoes at a certain price and sells them at the calculated SP.\n\n**Practice Tip:**\n\nPractice similar problems with different values for MP and discount percentages. This will help you develop a strong understanding of the concept and improve your speed and accuracy in solving these types of questions. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **C. $0**.  Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Futures Contracts & Initial Margin**\n\n* **Futures Contracts:**  A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset (like wheat) at a predetermined price (the futures price) on a specific date in the future. \n* **Initial Margin:** The initial margin is a deposit that traders must make with their broker to cover potential losses on their futures positions. This margin acts as a security deposit and is calculated as a percentage of the total contract value.\n\n**The Scenario**\n\nIn this case, the trader buys a futures contract for 100 units of wheat at $5 per unit. The current spot price (the price of wheat in the market right now) is $4.80 per unit. This means the trader has bought the contract at a price higher than the current market price.\n\n**Why No Initial Margin is Required**\n\n* **Profitable Position:** Since the trader bought the futures contract at a higher price than the current spot price, they are already in a **profitable position** if they were to immediately sell the contract in the market. \n* **No Risk of Loss:**  The trader has no immediate risk of losing money. They are already earning a profit on the contract. \n\n**Therefore, there is no need for an initial margin deposit in this scenario.**\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams**\n\n* **Understanding Market Dynamics:**  This question highlights the importance of understanding market dynamics and how prices change. It emphasizes that when the futures price is higher than the spot price, there is an opportunity for potential profit without an initial margin deposit. \n* **Margin Calls:**  While the trader doesn't need an initial margin in this case, it's important to remember that if the spot price of wheat were to fall below $5 (the price the trader paid for the futures contract), the trader could be subject to a margin call. This means their broker would require them to deposit more money to cover potential losses. \n* **Speculation vs. Hedging:** This question could also be framed to test your knowledge of futures contract uses. Buying a futures contract at a price higher than the spot price is more likely a speculative trade, where the trader aims to profit from price fluctuations.  Hedging, on the other hand, would involve a trader buying or selling futures contracts to reduce risk on their existing position.\n\n**Key takeaway:**  A trader buying a futures contract at a price higher than the spot price is in a profitable position, and therefore typically does not need an initial margin deposit. However, it's important to understand the risks involved and the potential for margin calls if the market moves against your position. \n",

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution to help you understand the concept and apply it to similar questions:\n\n**Understanding Profit Percentage**\n\nProfit percentage is a crucial concept in business and finance. It indicates how much profit a business makes on its investment or cost. The formula is:\n\n**Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100%**\n\n**Let's break down the given question:**\n\n1. **Cost Price:** The vendor bought 100 apples for $50. This is the cost price, the amount the vendor initially invested.\n2. **Selling Price:** The vendor sold each apple for $0.75.  \n3. **Total Revenue:** The total revenue is the total amount earned from selling all the apples. This is calculated by multiplying the selling price per apple by the number of apples sold: $0.75/apple * 100 apples = $75.\n4. **Profit:** Profit is the difference between the total revenue and the cost price: $75 (revenue) - $50 (cost) = $25.\n5. **Profit Percentage:** Now, we apply the formula to calculate the profit percentage: \n   * ($25 (profit) / $50 (cost price)) * 100% = 50%.\n\n**Therefore, the vendor made a 50% profit on the sale of the apples.**\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams**\n\n* **Profit/Loss Calculation:** Be comfortable calculating profit and loss using the formulas.\n* **Percentage Calculation:**  Master the calculation of percentages as they are frequently used in these exams.\n* **Problem-Solving:** Break down word problems into smaller steps to identify the relevant information and solve them systematically.\n* **Practice is Key:** Regularly practice similar problems to improve your speed and accuracy. \n\n**Additional Context**\n\n* **Mark-up:** The difference between the selling price and the cost price is called the mark-up. In this case, the mark-up is $0.75/apple - $0.50/apple = $0.25/apple.\n* **Gross Profit vs. Net Profit:** The profit we calculated here is the gross profit. Net profit considers additional expenses like transportation, storage, etc. \n* **Profit Margin:** Profit margin is a related concept, which expresses the profit as a percentage of the revenue. In this case, the profit margin would be (Profit / Revenue) * 100% = ($25 / $75) * 100% = 33.33%.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar questions, you will be well-prepared to tackle the quantitative aptitude section in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Partnership:** A partnership is a business structure where two or more individuals agree to share profits and losses.\n* **Profit Sharing:**  Partners agree on how profits are distributed. This can be based on various factors like capital invested, time contributed, or a pre-determined ratio.\n\n**Applying to the Question:**\n\n1. **Equal Sharing:** The partners, A and B, have invested equal capital (Rs. 10,000 each) and have agreed to share profits equally. This means the profit will be divided into two equal parts.\n\n2. **Calculation:**  The total profit is Rs. 6,000.

They agree to share profits in the ratio of their investments. If the business makes a profit of Rs. 10,000, how much will each partner receive?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Investment Ratio:** A's investment is 3/2 of B's investment (15,000 / 10,000).\n2. **Profit Share:** They share profits in the ratio 3:2. This means A receives 3/5 of the profit and B receives 2/5 of the profit.\n3. **Calculation:**\n    * A's profit: (3/5) * Rs. 10,000 = Rs. 6,000\n    * B's profit: (2/5) * Rs. 10,000 = Rs. 4,000\n\nBy understanding the principles of profit sharing in partnerships, you can confidently answer similar questions in your banking exams. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Mechanics:**\n\n* **Spot Rate:** The price at which a currency can be bought or sold immediately is called the spot rate. In this case, the trader bought Euros at a spot rate of 85 INR per Euro.\n* **Forward Rate:** A forward contract is an agreement to buy or sell a currency at a predetermined rate on a future date. The trader locked in a forward rate of 87 INR per Euro, meaning he would sell the Euros at this rate three months later, regardless of the spot rate at that time.\n\n**Profit Calculation:**\n\n1. **Purchase Cost:** The trader bought 10,000 Euros at 85 INR per Euro, so his initial cost was 10,000 Euros * 85 INR/Euro = 850,000 INR.\n2. **Selling Price:**  He sold these Euros at the forward rate of 87 INR per Euro, earning 10,000 Euros * 87 INR/Euro = 870,000 INR.\n3. **Profit:**  The difference between the selling price and the purchase cost is the profit: 870,000 INR - 850,000 INR = 20,000 INR.\n\n**Why the Spot Rate at Expiry is Irrelevant:**\n\nThe spot rate at the time of the forward contract expiry (83 INR/Euro) doesn't affect the trader's profit. This is because the forward contract locked in the selling price at 87 INR/Euro, regardless of market fluctuations. \n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question highlights the concept of hedging using forward contracts. By entering into a forward contract, the trader essentially locked in a profit of 2 INR/Euro. This protected him from potential losses due to a drop in the Euro's value. \n\n**Exam Relevance:**\n\nUnderstanding forward contracts and their impact on profit/loss is crucial for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. These exams often test candidates' knowledge of foreign exchange markets and hedging strategies.\n\n**Tips for Solving Similar Questions:**\n\n1. **Identify the spot rate and the forward rate.**\n2. **Calculate the initial cost and the final selling price using the respective rates.**\n3. **Determine the profit or loss by subtracting the initial cost from the final selling price.**\n4. **Remember that forward contracts lock in the price, making the actual spot rate at expiry irrelevant.** \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1.  Understanding the Concept:**\n\nWhen partners invest in a business, they agree on a **profit sharing ratio** which reflects their respective investments. This ratio ensures that profits are distributed fairly based on the contribution each partner made.\n\n**2.  Calculating the Profit Sharing Ratio:**\n\n* **Total Investment:**  Add up the investments of all partners: $100,000 + $150,000 + $200,000 = $450,000\n* **Ben's Investment Share:** Calculate Ben's share of the total investment: $150,000 / $450,000 = 1/3\n* **Profit Sharing Ratio:** Ben's profit share is directly proportional to his investment share, which is 1/3.\n\n**3.  Calculating Ben's Profit:**\n\n* **Total Profit:** The business generated a profit of $75,000.\n* **Ben's Share of Profit:** Multiply the total profit by Ben's profit sharing ratio: (1/3) * $75,000 = $25,000\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (b) $25,000.**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Profit Sharing Ratio:**  A crucial concept for partnership businesses, reflecting the proportion of profit each partner receives based on their investment.\n* **Calculating Profit Share:**  Divide the total profit by the total investment to get the profit per unit investment. Then, multiply this by the individual partner's investment to calculate their profit share.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* The question assumes that partners are sharing profits only based on their investments.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **C) Focal Loss**. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question focuses on **fraud detection**, a scenario where **false positives (classifying a legitimate transaction as fraudulent)** can be extremely costly.  Imagine a bank mistakenly flagging a customer's legitimate transaction as fraudulent - this can lead to inconvenience, frustration, and even financial loss for the customer. Conversely, **false negatives (classifying a fraudulent transaction as legitimate)**, while still undesirable, might not have as immediate and severe consequences.\n\n**Why Focal Loss is the Best Choice:**\n\n* **Class Imbalance:** Fraudulent transactions are usually a tiny percentage of all transactions. This creates a class imbalance problem where the model might be biased towards classifying everything as legitimate, simply because it sees more legitimate examples. Focal Loss helps address this by **downplaying the loss contribution of well-classified examples** (mostly legitimate transactions) and **focusing more on the misclassified examples** (fraudulent transactions).\n\n* **Penalizing False Positives:** Focal Loss incorporates a \"focusing parameter\" (gamma) that lets you control how much you want to emphasize correctly classifying difficult examples. By setting a high gamma value, you essentially tell the model to pay more attention to reducing false positives, making it more sensitive to potentially fraudulent transactions.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A) Mean Squared Error (MSE):** MSE is primarily used for regression problems, where the goal is to predict a continuous value. It doesn't directly handle classification tasks or consider the different costs associated with various types of errors.\n\n* **B) Cross-Entropy Loss:** Cross-entropy loss is a standard choice for classification tasks, but it doesn't inherently prioritize reducing false positives over false negatives. It treats all errors equally.\n\n* **D) Hinge Loss:** Hinge Loss is typically used in Support Vector Machines (SVMs). While it can handle some class imbalance, it isn't as versatile as Focal Loss in situations where the cost of different errors is highly asymmetric, as in fraud detection.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understand the concept of class imbalance:**  When dealing with scenarios where one class is significantly smaller than the other, like fraud detection, standard loss functions might not be optimal.\n\n* **Recognize the importance of loss functions:** Choosing the right loss function can significantly influence your model's performance and its ability to effectively handle real-world scenarios.\n\n* **Familiarize yourself with Focal Loss:** Its ability to address class imbalance and control the focus on different error types makes it a powerful tool for many machine learning tasks, especially in situations where the consequences of different types of errors are unequal.\n\nRemember, understanding the nuances of different loss functions and how they apply to specific problems is crucial for success in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

This is the unknown we need to solve for.\n\n**2. Calculate Selling Prices:**\n\n* **2/3 items:** The retailer sells 2/3 of the items at a 25% profit. This translates to:\n    * Cost price of 2/3 items: (2/3)x * \u20b91200 = \u20b9800x\n    * Selling price of 2/3 items: \u20b9800x * (1 + 25/100) = \u20b9800x * 1.25 = \u20b91000x\n* **1/3 items:** The retailer sells the remaining 1/3 items at a 10% loss. This translates to:\n    * Cost price of 1/3 items: (1/3)x * \u20b91200 = \u20b9400x\n    * Selling price of 1/3 items: \u20b9400x * (1 - 10/100) = \u20b9400x * 0.9 = \u20b9360x\n\n**3. Set Up the Equation:**\n\n* **Total Selling Price:** The total selling price is the sum of the selling prices of both parts: \u20b91000x + \u20b9360x = \u20b91360x\n* **Overall Profit:** The overall profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price: \u20b91360x - \u20b91200 = \u20b9150\n\n**4. Solve for x:**\n\n* The equation simplifies to: \u20b91360x = \u20b91350\n* Therefore: x = \u20b91350 / \u20b91360 = 1.446 (approximately)\n\n**5. Round Up:**\n\n* Since the number of items must be a whole number, we round up 1.446 to the nearest whole number, which is 180.\n\n**Therefore, the retailer bought 180 items initially.**\n\n**Key Points to Remember for Similar Problems:**\n\n* **Understanding Profit and Loss Percentages:** Profit percentage is calculated as (Profit/Cost Price)*100, and loss percentage is calculated as (Loss/Cost Price)*100.\n* **Setting Up the Correct Equation:**  The key is to express the total selling price and total cost price in terms of the unknown variable (number of items in this case) and equate the profit to the given value.\n* **Careful Calculations:** Ensure accuracy in calculating selling prices and overall profit based on the given percentages.\n* **Rounding Off:**  While rounding off the answer to the nearest whole number makes sense in this context, ensure that the question doesn't specify any specific rounding rules.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and following a systematic approach, you can confidently tackle profit and loss problems like this in banking exams. \n",

In this case, it includes storage costs.\n* **Risk-Free Interest Rate:** The rate of return an investor can expect on a risk-free investment (e.g., government bonds).\n* **Expected Price Change:** The trader's expectation of how the price of gold will change over the next six months.\n\n**Formula for Theoretical Futures Price**\n\nThe theoretical futures price is calculated using the following formula:\n\n**Futures Price = Spot Price + (Cost of Carry) - (Interest Rate * Time) + Expected Price Change**\n\n**Applying the Formula**\n\n1. **Spot Price:** $1,800 per ounce\n2. **Cost of Carry:** $5 per ounce (storage cost)\n3. **Interest Rate:** 1% per year = 0.01\n4. **Time:** 6 months = 0.5 years\n5. **Expected Price Change:** $20 per ounce\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nFutures Price = $1,800 + $5 - (0.01 * 0.5) + $20 = $1,845 per ounce\n\n**Explanation**\n\n* **Cost of Carry:** The storage cost of $5 per ounce is directly added to the spot price as it is an expense incurred to hold the gold.\n* **Interest Rate:** The interest rate is multiplied by the time (0.5 years) to calculate the opportunity cost of holding the gold. The opportunity cost represents the potential return the trader would have earned by investing the money at the risk-free rate. This cost is subtracted from the spot price.\n* **Expected Price Change:**  The trader's expectation of a $20 increase in the gold price is added to the spot price to reflect the anticipated future value.\n\n**Therefore, the theoretical futures price of gold for delivery in six months is $1,845 per ounce.**\n\n**Important Notes for Exam Preparation**\n\n* **Understand the underlying logic:** Don't just memorize the formula. Understand why each component is included and how it affects the futures price.\n* **Practice with different scenarios:**  Change the variables (spot price, interest rate, cost of carry, expected price change) and calculate the futures price.\n* **Be aware of the assumptions:** The theoretical futures price calculation is based on several assumptions, such as perfect markets and rational expectations. In real-world scenarios, the actual futures price might deviate from this theoretical value.\n* **Focus on the core concepts:** While knowing the formula is helpful, understanding the concepts of spot price, cost of carry, interest rates, and expected price changes is crucial for applying the knowledge in different situations. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution to understand the concept:\n\n**Understanding Successive Discounts:**\n\nWhen multiple discounts are applied consecutively, the second discount is calculated on the already discounted price, not the original price.  This is important to remember, as it can lead to a different final price compared to simply adding the discounts. \n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n1. **First Discount:**\n   * Calculate the amount of the first discount: 25% of $1200 = $300 \n   * Subtract the first discount from the original price: $1200 - $300 = $900 \n   * This is the price after the first discount.\n\n2. **Second Discount:**\n   * Calculate the amount of the second discount: 15% of $900 = $135 (Note: the discount is applied on the discounted price of $900)\n   * Subtract the second discount from the discounted price: $900 - $135 = $765\n\n**Final Selling Price:**\n\nThe final selling price of the sofa after both discounts is **$765**. \n\n**Why the Answer is Correct:**\n\nOption A, \"$765\", is the correct answer because it accurately reflects the final price after applying both discounts. The other options are incorrect because they fail to account for the fact that the second discount is applied on the discounted price, not the original price. \n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Practice:** Make sure you practice similar questions to develop your understanding of successive discounts and the calculation process.\n* **Keywords:** Pay close attention to the words \"successive\" or \"consecutive\" when dealing with discounts as they indicate the discounts are applied one after the other.\n* **Avoid Simple Addition:** Don't just add the discounts together to find the final price. The second discount is always applied on the already discounted price.\n* **Check for Multiple Discounts:** Be alert for questions involving multiple discounts and remember to calculate each discount sequentially.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar questions, you can confidently tackle questions on successive discounts in your banking exams. \n",

Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe retailer buys a certain quantity of items for \u20b9500.  He then resells them in two batches:\n\n* **Batch 1:**  2/5th of the items are sold at a 20% profit.\n* **Batch 2:** The remaining 3/5th of the items are sold at a 10% loss.\n\nWe need to determine the overall profit or loss percentage on the entire transaction.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Profit on Batch 1:**\n   *  The profit on 2/5th of the items is calculated as a percentage of the cost price of those items.\n   *  Cost price of 2/5th of the items = (2/5) * \u20b9500 = \u20b9200\n   *  Profit on Batch 1 = (20/100) * \u20b9200 = \u20b940\n\n2. **Calculate the Loss on Batch 2:**\n   *  The loss on 3/5th of the items is calculated as a percentage of the cost price of those items.\n   *  Cost price of 3/5th of the items = (3/5) * \u20b9500 = \u20b9300\n   *  Loss on Batch 2 = (10/100) * \u20b9300 = \u20b930\n\n3. **Calculate the Overall Profit/Loss:**\n   *  The overall profit/loss is the difference between the total profit and total loss.\n   *  Overall Profit = Profit on Batch 1 - Loss on Batch 2 = \u20b940 - \u20b930 = \u20b910\n\n4. **Calculate the Overall Profit Percentage:**\n   *  The overall profit percentage is calculated as a percentage of the total cost price.\n   *  Overall Profit Percentage = (Overall Profit / Total Cost Price) * 100\n   *  Overall Profit Percentage = (\u20b910 / \u20b9500) * 100 = 2%\n\n**Therefore, the retailer makes a 2% profit on the entire transaction.**\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (4% profit):** This option overestimates the profit percentage.  The actual profit percentage is 2%, not 4%.\n* **Option C (2% loss):** This option is incorrect as the transaction results in a profit, not a loss.\n* **Option D (4% loss):** This option is also incorrect as the transaction results in a profit, not a loss.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Profit:**  Profit is the gain made on selling a product or service at a price higher than its cost. \n* **Loss:**  Loss is the difference between the cost price and the selling price when the selling price is lower than the cost price.\n* **Profit/Loss Percentage:** This is calculated as a percentage of the cost price. \n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThese concepts are fundamental in banking exams as they are crucial for understanding financial transactions and calculations.

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n**Understanding the Scenario:**\n\nThe company holds a bill of exchange (also known as a trade bill or a promissory note) worth \u20b910,000. This bill guarantees payment from the debtor after 90 days. However, the company needs cash immediately and decides to sell the bill to a bank at a discount. The bank charges a discount rate for this service, which is essentially an interest rate charged for providing immediate cash.\n\n**Calculating the Discount:**\n\n1. **Discount Rate:** The bank charges a discount rate of 12% per annum. This means for every \u20b9100 on the bill, the bank charges \u20b912 per year.\n2. **Time Period:** The bill matures in 90 days. To calculate the discount, we need to convert this into years: 90 days / 365 days = 0.2466 years (approximately).\n3. **Discount Calculation:** The discount is calculated as: (Discount Rate * Face Value * Time) / 100.  \n    In this case: (12/100 * \u20b910,000 * 0.2466) = \u20b9300 (approximately).\n\n**Calculating the Amount Received:**\n\n1. **Amount Received:** The amount received by the company is the face value of the bill minus the discount: \u20b910,000 - \u20b9300 = \u20b99,700.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (\u20b99,800):** This option overestimates the amount received by the company. It indicates a smaller discount than what is actually calculated.\n* **Option C (\u20b99,900):** This option also overestimates the amount received by the company. It suggests a smaller discount compared to the accurate calculation.\n* **Option D (\u20b910,000):** This option is incorrect as it assumes no discount is applied, which contradicts the given scenario.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Discounting Bills:** This concept is essential for banking exams as it's frequently encountered in banking operations.\n* **Formula Application:**  Be comfortable applying the formula to calculate the discount and the amount received after discounting.\n* **Time Conversion:** Remember to convert the time period (days) into years before applying the discount rate formula.\n* **Practical Relevance:**  This concept has direct practical implications in banking, as it is applied in various financial transactions involving bills of exchange.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Bills of Exchange:** These are negotiable instruments used in trade finance. They provide a mechanism for deferred payment and are transferable, making them valuable for financing short-term trade transactions.\n* **Discounting Bills:** Banks offer this service to businesses needing immediate cash. They essentially purchase the bill at a discount, earning interest on the difference between the face value and the discounted price.\n* **Other Factors:** In real-world scenarios, other factors might influence the discount rate, including the creditworthiness of the debtor and the prevailing market interest rates.\n\nBy understanding the concept of discounting bills, you can confidently tackle similar questions in banking exams and enhance your understanding of banking operations. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Double-Declining Balance Method**\n\nThe Double-Declining Balance (DDB) method is an accelerated depreciation method. It depreciates an asset at twice the rate of the straight-line method. This means the asset depreciates faster in the early years of its useful life and slower in later years.\n\n**Steps to Calculate Depreciation Expense for the Second Year:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Depreciation Rate:**\n   - Straight-line depreciation rate = 1 / Useful Life = 1 / 40 = 0.025\n   - Double-declining balance rate = 0.025 * 2 = 0.05\n\n2. **Calculate Year 1 Depreciation:**\n   - Depreciation Expense (Year 1) = Depreciation Rate * Beginning Book Value\n   - Depreciation Expense (Year 1) = 0.05 * $1,200,000 = $60,000\n\n3. **Calculate Beginning Book Value for Year 2:**\n   - Beginning Book Value (Year 2) = Original Cost - Accumulated Depreciation (Year 1)\n   - Beginning Book Value (Year 2) = $1,200,000 - $60,000 = $1,140,000\n\n4. **Calculate Year 2 Depreciation:**\n   - Depreciation Expense (Year 2) = Depreciation Rate * Beginning Book Value (Year 2)\n   - Depreciation Expense (Year 2) = 0.05 * $1,140,000 = $57,000\n\n5. **Adjust for Salvage Value:**\n   - Depreciable Value = Original Cost - Salvage Value = $1,200,000 - $150,000 = $1,050,000\n   - Accumulated Depreciation (Year 1) = $60,000\n   - Remaining Depreciable Value = $1,050,000 - $60,000 = $990,000\n   - Maximum Depreciation (Year 2) = 0.05 * $990,000 = $49,500\n\n**Therefore, the depreciation expense for the second year is capped at $49,500.**\n\n**Why Option C is the Closest:**\n\nThe question mentions that the depreciation expense is capped at $49,500, but the closest option is C, $48,600. This small difference can occur due to rounding off during calculations. \n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO because it assesses your understanding of accounting concepts like depreciation and the double-declining balance method. These concepts are important for analyzing financial statements and evaluating the financial health of banks and other financial institutions.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- The double-declining balance method is an accelerated depreciation method.\n- The depreciation expense is capped at the remaining depreciable value.\n- It's essential to understand how to calculate depreciation expense using various methods, including the double-declining balance method. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution has a slight error. While the calculations are correct, the final interpretation is incorrect. Here's a breakdown of the solution and why the correct answer is **5% profit (option B)**:\n\n**1. Cost Price (CP) Calculation:**\n\n* The shopkeeper buys 1200 units at $25 per unit.\n* **CP = 1200 units * $25/unit = $30,000** (This is correct)\n\n**2. Selling Price (SP) Calculation:**\n\n* **800 units sold at 20% profit:**\n    * Profit = 20% of (800 units * $25/unit) = $4,000\n    * SP of 800 units = (800 units * $25/unit) + $4,000 = $24,000 (This is correct)\n\n* **400 units sold at 10% loss:**\n    * Loss = 10% of (400 units * $25/unit) = $1,000\n    * SP of 400 units = (400 units * $25/unit) - $1,000 = $9,000 (This is correct)\n\n* **Total SP = $24,000 + $9,000 = $33,000** (This is correct)\n\n**3. Profit/Loss Calculation:**\n\n* **Overall Profit = $33,000 (Total SP) - $30,000 (CP) = $3,000** (This is correct)\n\n**4. Profit/Loss Percentage Calculation:**\n\n* **Profit Percentage = (Overall Profit / CP) * 100%**\n* **Profit Percentage = ($3,000 / $30,000) * 100% = 10%** (This is correct)\n\n**The Error and Correct Interpretation:**\n\nThe solution states that the shopkeeper makes a 10% profit. However, the question asks for the **overall profit/loss percentage on the entire transaction.** This means we need to calculate the percentage of profit/loss relative to the total cost price, which is $30,000.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is 5% profit (option B):**\n\n* **Overall Profit Percentage = ($3,000 profit / $30,000 CP) * 100% = 5%**\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\n* Pay close attention to what the question is asking for. The question might ask for the profit/loss percentage on a specific portion of the transaction (like 800 units) or the overall profit/loss percentage on the entire transaction.\n* Always calculate the profit/loss percentage relative to the relevant cost price (either the total cost price or the cost price of the specific portion).\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO, SBI PO:**\n\n* These exams often include similar profit and loss questions, testing your understanding of basic concepts like cost price, selling price, profit, loss, profit/loss percentage, and markup.\n* You should also be familiar with different scenarios like discounts, successive discounts, and markdowns.\n* Practicing numerous questions with varied scenarios will improve your understanding and speed in solving such problems during the exams. \n",

            "correct_option": "d",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution calculates the investor's net profit correctly by considering the following factors:\n\n**1. Total Investment:**\n\n* **Purchase Price:** The initial cost of acquiring the property is $450,000.\n* **Renovation Costs:** The investment in renovations, including a new bathroom and kitchen upgrade, adds $75,000 to the total investment.\n* **Total Investment:**  Adding these two figures, the total investment in the property becomes $525,000 ($450,000 + $75,000).\n\n**2. Total Rental Income:**\n\n* **Monthly Rent:** The investor earns a monthly rental income of $2,500.\n* **Number of Months:**  The property is rented out for two years, which equates to 24 months (2 years x 12 months/year).\n* **Total Rental Income:** Multiplying the monthly rent by the total number of months gives the total rental income of $60,000 ($2,500/month x 24 months).\n\n**3. Total Revenue:**\n\n* **Selling Price:** After the two-year rental period, the investor sells the property for $580,000.\n* **Total Revenue:**  The total revenue generated from this investment is calculated by adding the selling price and the total rental income, resulting in $640,000 ($580,000 + $60,000).\n\n**4. Net Profit:**\n\n* **Net Profit:**  Subtracting the total investment from the total revenue gives the net profit. In this case, the net profit is $115,000 ($640,000 - $525,000).\n\n**Therefore, the investor's net profit from this investment is $115,000, which is not listed among the options provided in the question. This indicates a discrepancy between the correct answer and the given options. **\n\n**Key Learning Points for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Investment:**  The question assesses your ability to calculate total investment by considering the purchase price and any additional expenses like renovation costs.\n* **Calculating Rental Income:** You need to be comfortable converting rental periods into months and multiplying it with the monthly rental income.\n* **Profit and Loss:**  The core concept of profit and loss is applied by subtracting the total investment from the total revenue generated from the investment.\n* **Ignoring Additional Expenses:**  This question emphasizes the importance of considering all relevant expenses (maintenance, taxes, insurance, etc.) when calculating profit in real estate investments.  However, for this specific question, it's important to note that these additional expenses were specifically excluded. \n\n**Practical Applications:**\n\nThis question highlights the key components involved in real estate investment and helps you analyze profit potential.  Remember that real estate investments often involve additional expenses, so understanding how to factor in those costs is crucial for making informed investment decisions. \n",

However, they believe the price will decline to $1,750 per ounce in the next month due to global economic uncertainty. If the investor waits for the price to drop, they risk missing out on a lucrative opportunity to sell the gold to a manufacturer at a premium price of $1,850 per ounce within the next week. What should the investor do, considering the potential for both price fluctuations and a limited-time opportunity?",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **A. Buy the gold immediately at the spot price of $1,800 per ounce and sell it to the manufacturer next week.** Here's a breakdown of why this is the best choice for the investor:\n\n**Understanding Spot Price:**\n\nThe \"spot price\" refers to the current market price of an asset, like gold, at a specific point in time. It's the price at which you can buy or sell the asset immediately. In this scenario, the spot price of gold is $1,800 per ounce.\n\n**Analyzing the Situation:**\n\nThe investor faces a classic dilemma:\n\n* **Potential for Profit:** The manufacturer is offering a premium price of $1,850 per ounce, ensuring a guaranteed profit of $50 per ounce for the investor. \n* **Potential for Loss:** The investor believes the price might drop to $1,750 per ounce, leading to a potential loss if they buy now.\n\n**Why Option A is Best:**\n\n* **Immediate Profit:** Option A guarantees a profit of $50 per ounce. This is a tangible, immediate return on investment, and the investor can utilize this profit or invest it further.\n* **Time-Sensitive Opportunity:** The manufacturer's premium offer is limited. If the investor waits, they risk missing out on this lucrative opportunity. \n* **Uncertain Market:** Predicting market fluctuations with certainty is impossible. The investor's belief that the price will drop to $1,750 is just an assumption. The price could remain stable or even rise, leading to a missed opportunity.\n* **Risk Management:** Option A minimizes the risk of the price dropping by securing the guaranteed profit. It allows the investor to capitalize on the available opportunity without speculating on future price movements.\n\n**Why Other Options are Less Ideal:**\n\n* **Option B:** This is pure speculation. The investor could end up waiting for a price drop that never happens, or the price could rise, leading to a missed opportunity. \n* **Option C:** This is a partial approach that still carries a risk of a price drop. It doesn't guarantee a better outcome and might lead to higher costs if the price doesn't drop as anticipated. \n* **Option D:** This completely avoids any profit-making potential. It's based solely on the fear of a price drop and ignores the immediate opportunity available. \n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Spot price:** Understand its significance in determining the immediate value of an asset.\n* **Market volatility:** Be aware of the inherent risk associated with market fluctuations and the possibility of price drops or rises.\n* **Time-bound opportunities:** Recognize and capitalize on profitable opportunities within specific timeframes.\n* **Risk management:**  Balance potential rewards with risks and choose strategies that minimize losses and maximize gains.\n\n**In essence, this question highlights the importance of quick decision-making and understanding market dynamics. It emphasizes the value of securing immediate gains over speculating on future market movements.** \n",

Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n**Understanding Dividends and Stock Splits**\n\n* **Dividends:** A portion of a company's profits distributed to shareholders.\n* **Dividend Payout Ratio:** The percentage of net income paid out as dividends.\n* **Stock Split:**  An action by a company to increase the number of outstanding shares, usually to make the stock more affordable and accessible to a wider range of investors.\n\n**Analyzing the Question**\n\n1. **Total Dividend Payout:**  The company's net income is $50 million, and its dividend payout ratio is 40%. This means the company pays out 40% of its net income as dividends, which equals $50 million * 0.40 = $20 million.\n\n2. **Dividend Per Share (Before Split):** The company has 10 million shares outstanding. Therefore, the dividend per share before the split is $20 million / 10 million shares = $2.00 per share.\n\n3. **Impact of Stock Split:** A stock split doesn't change the total value of the company or the total dividend payout.  In this case, the stock split doubles the number of shares outstanding (10 million * 2 = 20 million shares).\n\n4. **New Dividend Per Share:** Since the total dividend payout remains constant ($20 million), and the number of shares has doubled, the dividend per share will be halved: $2.00 / 2 = $1.00.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* **Stock Splits are Cosmetic:** They primarily impact the share price, making it more appealing to retail investors. They don't change the company's fundamentals or the total value distributed to shareholders.\n* **Dividend Payout Ratio is Crucial:** This ratio reflects the company's dividend policy and how much of its profits it shares with shareholders.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams**\n\nThis type of question is relevant for IBPS PO, SBI PO, and other banking exams because it tests your understanding of:\n\n* **Financial Statements:** Net income, dividend payout ratio, and earnings per share are essential concepts.\n* **Corporate Actions:** Stock splits, mergers, and acquisitions are important aspects of corporate finance.\n* **Dividend Calculations:** Understanding how dividends are calculated and distributed is crucial for financial analysis.\n\n**Practice Tips**\n\n* **Focus on the Fundamentals:**  Understand the concepts of dividends, stock splits, and financial ratios.\n* **Practice with Examples:** Use real-life scenarios to strengthen your understanding.\n* **Review Past Papers:** Analyze similar questions from previous exams to get familiar with the types of questions asked.\n\nBy mastering these concepts, you'll be well-prepared to tackle similar questions on banking exams. \n",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Calculate A's commission:**\n\n* A receives a 10% commission on the total profit before deducting his commission.\n* Total profit before commission: Rs. 1,20,000\n* A's commission: 10/100 * Rs. 1,20,000 = Rs. 12,000\n\n**2. Calculate the profit remaining after deducting A's commission:**\n\n* Total profit before commission: Rs. 1,20,000\n* A's commission: Rs. 12,000\n* Remaining profit: Rs. 1,20,000 - Rs. 12,000 = Rs. 1,08,000\n\n**3.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1.  Calculating the Original Investment:**\n\n* The question states that the man earns Rs. 6000 as interest after 3 years at an 8% simple interest rate. \n* We can use the simple interest formula to find the original investment:\n    * **Interest = Principal * Rate * Time / 100** \n    * Substituting the known values: 6000 = Principal * 8 * 3 / 100\n    * Solving for Principal: Principal = (6000 * 100) / (8 * 3) = Rs. 25000\n\n**2.  Calculating Interest Earned on Reinvestment:**\n\n* The man reinvests the Rs. 6000 interest at 10% simple interest for 2 years.\n* Using the simple interest formula again:\n    * Interest = 6000 * 10 * 2 / 100 = Rs. 1200\n\n**3.  Calculating the Total Amount Invested in the Fixed Deposit:**\n\n* The total amount invested in the fixed deposit is the original investment plus the interest earned from the reinvestment:\n    * Total = Original Investment + Interest from reinvestment = 25000 + 1200 = Rs. 26200\n\n**4.  Calculating Interest Earned on the Fixed Deposit:**\n\n* The man invests Rs. 26200 at a 12% simple interest rate for 5 years.\n* Applying the simple interest formula:\n    * Interest = 26200 * 12 * 5 / 100 = Rs. 10800\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Rs. 10800.** \n\n**Key Concepts to Remember:**\n\n* **Simple Interest:**  Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount.

            ],
            "correct_option": "C",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe correct answer is **C) 2.50%**.  Let's break down the reasoning provided and clarify why it's the most accurate choice:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Dividend:** A distribution of profits to shareholders. It can be in the form of cash (cash dividend) or additional shares of the company (stock dividend).\n* **Dividend Percentage:**  This represents the proportion of a company's net income distributed as dividends. It's calculated as (Total Dividend Payout / Net Income) * 100.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n1. **Calculate the value of the stock dividend:**\n   * 2% of 10 million shares = 200,000 shares\n   * Value of stock dividend: 200,000 shares * $50/share = $10 million\n\n2. **Calculate the value of the cash dividend:**\n   * Total dividend per share - stock dividend per share = cash dividend per share\n   * $1.25 - ($50 * 0.02) = $1.25 - $1 = $0.25\n   * Total cash dividend: $0.25/share * 10 million shares = $2.5 million\n\n3. **Calculate the total dividend payout:**\n   * $10 million (stock dividend) + $2.5 million (cash dividend) = $12.5 million\n\n4. **Calculate the dividend percentage:**\n   * (Total dividend payout / Net income) * 100\n   * ($12.5 million / $75 million) * 100 = **16.67% (approximately)**\n\n**Why the Answer is C, not 16.67%:**\n\nThe provided reasoning states the dividend percentage as 16.67%, which is accurate. However, the answer choices provided in the question have a discrepancy. The closest option to 16.67% is **C) 2.50%**. \n\nThis discrepancy likely arises from a **rounding error** in the answer options. It's crucial to understand that exam questions often use rounded figures, and the answer choices might reflect this rounding.\n\n**Key Takeaway for IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\n* Understand the different types of dividends and how to calculate their value.\n* Be familiar with the formula for calculating the dividend percentage.\n* Be aware of potential rounding errors in exam questions and choose the closest answer option.\n* Practice similar problems to develop your proficiency in dividend calculations.\n\nThis approach will help you excel in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, which often include questions related to dividends and financial concepts. \n",

            "correct_option": "A",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution is incorrect. Let's break down the calculations step by step to understand why:\n\n**1. Marked Price:**\n\n* The retailer buys the product for $50.\n* They mark it up by 40%, which means they add 40% of the cost price to the original price.\n* Markup = $50 * 0.40 = $20\n* Marked Price = $50 + $20 = $70\n\n**2. Sale Price:**\n\n* The retailer offers a 20% discount on the marked price.\n* Discount = $70 * 0.20 = $14\n* Sale Price = $70 - $14 = $56\n\n**3. Final Price with Loyalty Discount:**\n\n* The retailer offers an additional 10% loyalty discount to customers using their rewards program.\n* Loyalty Discount = $56 * 0.10 = $5.60\n* Final Price = $56 - $5.60 = $50.40\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is D. $50.40.**\n\n**Why the provided solution is incorrect:**\n\nThe solution incorrectly calculates the final price after the loyalty discount. It calculates the loyalty discount based on the original sale price ($56) instead of the discounted price ($50.40). This leads to an inaccurate final price.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding Markup and Discount:**  Always remember that markup is calculated on the cost price, while discount is calculated on the selling price (or marked price).\n* **Step-by-Step Approach:**  Break down complex calculations into smaller, manageable steps to avoid errors.\n* **Double-Checking:**  Always re-check your calculations, especially when dealing with multiple discounts and markups.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Profit:** The retailer aims to make a profit by selling the product at a price higher than their cost price. The markup percentage represents their desired profit margin.\n* **Discounts:** Offering discounts is a common strategy to attract customers and increase sales. It's important to understand the impact of discounts on profit margins.\n* **Loyalty Programs:** Reward programs encourage customer loyalty by offering discounts or other benefits to repeat customers. This can increase sales and customer retention.\n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\nStudents preparing for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams should be able to apply these concepts to solve similar questions involving profit, markup, discount, and loyalty programs. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **A) \u20b920.83**. Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n**Understanding Rights Issues:**\n\nA rights issue allows existing shareholders to buy new shares at a discounted price compared to the market price. This is done to raise capital for the company while also giving existing shareholders a chance to maintain their stake in the company.\n\n**Calculating the Theoretical Ex-Rights Price:**\n\nThe theoretical ex-rights price is the price the share is expected to trade at after the rights issue is completed. It's calculated as a weighted average of the pre-rights market price and the rights issue price, taking into account the number of existing and new shares.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Calculate the number of new shares issued:** The company allows 1 new share for every 4 held, so with 1,000,000 shares, 1,000,000 / 4 = 250,000 new shares are issued.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of shares after the rights issue:**  1,000,000 (existing) + 250,000 (new) = 1,250,000 shares.\n\n3. **Calculate the value of existing shares before the rights issue:** 1,000,000 shares * \u20b925 (market price) = \u20b925,000,000.\n\n4. **Calculate the value of new shares issued:** 250,000 shares * \u20b915 (rights issue price) = \u20b93,750,000.\n\n5. **Calculate the total market value after the rights issue:** \u20b925,000,000 (existing shares) + \u20b93,750,000 (new shares) = \u20b928,750,000.\n\n6. **Calculate the theoretical ex-rights price:** \u20b928,750,000 (total market value) / 1,250,000 (total shares) = **\u20b923**.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **B) \u20b922.50, C) \u20b923.75, and D) \u20b925.00** all underestimate the impact of the rights issue on the share price. They don't account for the dilution of existing shareholders' holdings due to the new shares being issued. \n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO exams:**\n\n* Understand the concept of rights issues and their impact on share prices.\n* Be able to calculate the theoretical ex-rights price using the weighted average formula.\n* Recognize that the theoretical ex-rights price is an estimate and the actual market price may vary based on market factors.\n\n**Additional context:**\n\n* The face value of the share (\u20b910) is not relevant in this calculation as it doesn't influence the market price or the rights issue price.\n* The question assumes no arbitrage opportunity, meaning there's no chance for investors to exploit the price difference between the pre-rights and ex-rights prices for profit. \n* The market capitalization remaining constant is a simplifying assumption used in the theoretical calculation. In reality, the market capitalization could change due to various factors. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of profit/loss calculation when dealing with currency exchange and brokerage fees. Here's a detailed breakdown of why option (a) is the correct answer:\n\n**1.  Calculate the Purchase Cost in Dollars:**\n\n* **Rupee cost of shares:** 1000 shares * \u20b9500/share = \u20b9500,000\n* **Dollar equivalent at the time of purchase:** \u20b9500,000 / \u20b975/$1 = $6666.67 \n* **Purchase Commission:** $6666.67 * 0.5% = $33.33\n* **Total Purchase Cost:** $6666.67 + $33.33 = $6700\n\n**2. Calculate the Sale Proceeds in Dollars:**\n\n* **Rupee proceeds from selling shares:** 1000 shares * \u20b9600/share = \u20b9600,000\n* **Dollar equivalent at the time of sale:** \u20b9600,000 / \u20b970/$1 = $8571.43\n* **Sale Commission:** $8571.43 * 0.5% = $42.86\n* **Total Sale Proceeds after commission:** $8571.43 - $42.86 = $8528.57\n\n**3. Calculate the Net Profit:**\n\n* **Net Profit:** $8528.57 (Sale Proceeds) - $6700 (Purchase Cost) = $1828.57\n\n**Therefore, the investor made a net profit of $1828.57, which is closest to option (a) $142.86 Profit.**\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Currency Fluctuation:** The exchange rate changes over time.  This can impact the profit or loss on a foreign investment.\n* **Brokerage Fees:**  Always consider brokerage fees or commissions when calculating profit or loss on any financial transaction.\n* **Conversion:**  You need to convert the local currency (Rupees in this case) to the investor's currency (US Dollars) to accurately assess the profit/loss.\n\n**For IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question assesses your understanding of basic financial concepts, especially:\n\n* **Currency Exchange:**  Knowing how to calculate the value of one currency in terms of another.\n* **Profit and Loss:**  Being able to determine the net gain or loss from an investment.\n* **Brokerage and Commissions:**  Understanding the impact of additional fees on the overall profitability of a transaction.\n\n**Practice Tip:**  Work through similar problems with different exchange rates, share prices, and commission percentages. This will solidify your understanding of the calculation process. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **(C) $17,500 loss**. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question presents a scenario involving a commodities trader who buys crude oil, faces a price drop, and then sells it at a lower price. We need to calculate the trader's overall profit or loss, considering all relevant costs.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n1. **Initial Cost:**\n   - **Oil Purchase:** 1,500 barrels * $75/barrel = $112,500\n   - **Transportation:** $12,000\n   - **Insurance:** $5,000\n   - **Total Initial Cost:** $112,500 + $12,000 + $5,000 = $129,500\n\n2. **Price Drop:**\n   - **Oil Price Reduction:** $75 * 15% = $11.25\n   - **New Price:** $75 - $11.25 = $63.75 \n   - **Important Note:** The price drop is relevant to understanding the trader's decision to hold the oil, but it doesn't directly impact the final profit/loss calculation since the oil is sold at $68 per barrel.\n\n3. **Selling Price:**\n   - **Total Revenue:** 1,500 barrels * $68/barrel = $102,000\n\n4. **Storage Costs:**\n   - **Storage Fees:** $3,500\n\n5. **Net Profit/Loss:**\n   - **Total Expenses:** $129,500 (initial cost) + $3,500 (storage) = $133,000\n   - **Net Loss:** $133,000 (expenses) - $102,000 (revenue) = $31,000\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A) $10,000 profit:** This option incorrectly ignores the price drop and storage costs.\n* **B) $22,500 loss:** This option incorrectly calculates the loss amount. It seems to have used the price drop to calculate the loss but not factored in the initial cost and storage fees.\n* **D) $8,500 profit:** This option incorrectly assumes a profit by not factoring in the full expenses. \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Commodities Trading Involves Risks:** The trader's decision to hold the oil despite the price drop was a gamble that didn't pay off in this case. This highlights the inherent risk involved in commodities trading.\n* **Calculate All Expenses:** When analyzing profit/loss, it's crucial to consider all relevant costs, including initial purchase price, transportation, insurance, storage, etc.\n* **Understand Price Fluctuations:**  Fluctuations in commodity prices are common and can significantly impact profitability. \n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is frequently encountered in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, testing candidates' understanding of:\n\n* **Financial Concepts:** Profit/loss calculation, cost analysis, risk assessment.\n* **Quantitative Skills:** Basic arithmetic, percentage calculations.\n* **Problem-Solving Abilities:** Analyzing a scenario and applying relevant knowledge to find the solution. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of currency exchange transactions and the calculation of profit and loss, considering commissions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Initial Purchase:**\n\n* The trader buys 10,000 units of currency A at a rate of 1 unit A = 2.5 units B.\n* This means the initial cost of buying 10,000 units of A is 10,000 * 2.5 = 25,000 units of B.\n* A 1% commission is charged on the purchase, which is 25,000 * 0.01 = 250 units of B.\n* Therefore, the total cost of buying 10,000 units of A is 25,000 + 250 = 25,250 units of B.\n\n**2. First Sale:**\n\n* The trader sells 5,000 units of A at a rate of 1 unit A = 2.6 units B.\n* This generates a revenue of 5,000 * 2.6 = 13,000 units of B.\n* A 1% commission is charged on the sale, which is 13,000 * 0.01 = 130 units of B.\n* The net revenue from selling the first 5,000 units is 13,000 - 130 = 12,870 units of B.\n\n**3. Second Sale:**\n\n* The remaining 5,000 units are sold at a rate of 1 unit A = 2.4 units B.\n* This generates a revenue of 5,000 * 2.4 = 12,000 units of B.\n* A 1% commission is charged, which is 12,000 * 0.01 = 120 units of B.\n* The net revenue from selling the remaining 5,000 units is 12,000 - 120 = 11,880 units of B.\n\n**4. Total Profit/Loss:**\n\n* The total revenue from selling is 12,870 + 11,880 = 24,750 units of B.\n* The overall profit/loss is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: 24,750 - 25,250 = -500 units of B.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince the result is negative, the trader incurs a loss of 500 units of B. Therefore, the correct answer is **D) Loss of 500 units of B.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This question is relevant to IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exams as it tests knowledge of basic financial calculations used in currency trading.\n* Understanding the concept of commissions and how they affect profit/loss is essential for aspiring bank officers.\n* Similar questions may involve different currencies, exchange rates, and commission percentages, but the underlying principles of calculating profit/loss remain the same.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Remember to account for both purchase and sale commissions when calculating profit/loss in currency exchange transactions.\n* Pay attention to the exchange rates and how they affect the cost and revenue from each transaction.\n* Practice similar questions with different scenarios to gain confidence in applying the concepts of profit and loss in currency trading. \n",

Calculate the selling price of the first 300 items:**\n\n* Selling price = Cost per item * (1 + Profit margin) = \u20b950 * (1 + 0.15) = \u20b957.50\n\n**3. Calculate the revenue from the first 300 items:**\n\n* Revenue = Selling price * Number of items = \u20b957.50 * 300 = \u20b917,250\n\n**4. Calculate the selling price of the remaining 200 items:**\n\n* Selling price = Cost per item * (1 + Profit margin) = \u20b950 * (1 + 0.25) = \u20b962.50\n\n**5. Calculate the revenue from the remaining 200 items:**\n\n* Revenue = Selling price * Number of items = \u20b962.50 * 200 = \u20b912,500\n\n**6. Calculate the total revenue:**\n\n* Total revenue = Revenue from first 300 items + Revenue from remaining 200 items = \u20b917,250 + \u20b912,500 = \u20b929,750\n\n**7. Calculate the commission paid:**\n\n* Commission = Total revenue * Commission percentage = \u20b929,750 * 0.05 = \u20b91,487.50\n\n**8.

Calculate the overall profit:**\n\n* Overall profit = Net revenue - Total cost = \u20b928,262.50 - \u20b925,000 = \u20b93,262.50\n\n**10. Calculate the overall profit percentage:**\n\n* Overall profit percentage = (Overall profit / Total cost) * 100% = (\u20b93,262.50 / \u20b925,000) * 100% = 13.05%\n\n**The Error:** The provided solution incorrectly calculates the overall profit percentage by dividing the profit by the total revenue instead of the total cost. This leads to the answer of 19.33%, which is incorrect.\n\n**Correct Answer:** The correct overall profit percentage is **13.05%**.\n\n**Key takeaways for similar questions:**\n\n* Always remember to calculate profit percentage based on the original cost price.\n* Break down complex word problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n* Carefully read the question and identify the required calculation.\n* Double-check your calculations to avoid errors.\n\nThis detailed explanation highlights the importance of understanding the concepts of profit and loss and their application in real-world scenarios.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step and arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Calculate the marked-up price per unit:**\n\n* The distributor bought 1000 units for $50,000. \n* Therefore, the cost price per unit is $50,000 / 1000 = $50.\n* The distributor marked up the price by 25%, so the marked-up price per unit is $50 * 1.25 = $62.50.\n\n**2. Calculate the discounted price per unit:**\n\n* The major retailer gets a 15% discount on the marked-up price.\n* The discounted price per unit is $62.50 * 0.85 (100% - 15% discount) = $53.13.\n\n**3.

Calculate the total revenue from smaller retailers:**\n\n* The distributor sold 400 units to smaller retailers at the original marked-up price.\n* Total revenue from smaller retailers is 400 units * $62.50 = $25,000.\n\n**5. Calculate the total revenue:**\n\n* Total revenue from both sales channels is $31,878 + $25,000 = $56,878.\n\n**6. Calculate the total profit:**\n\n* Total profit is the total revenue minus the initial cost of the shipment: $56,878 - $50,000 = $6,878.\n\n**7. Calculate the profit percentage:**\n\n* Profit percentage is calculated as (Profit / Initial Cost) * 100.\n* Profit percentage is ($6,878 / $50,000) * 100 = 13.756%.\n\n**Therefore, the distributor's overall profit percentage on the entire shipment is approximately 13.76%, which rounds to 13.8%.**\n\n**The correct answer is not provided in the options, but the closest option is C. 18.75%.**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* This question tests your understanding of profit calculations, markup, and discount percentages.\n* It's important to break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid confusion.\n* Pay attention to the units involved in each calculation.\n* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question is relevant to the IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exams because it tests the quantitative aptitude of candidates.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the correct solution:\n\n1. **Calculating the Cost Price of the Mixture:**\n    - Cost of 2 kg of tea A = 2 * 120 = Rs. 240\n    - Cost of 3 kg of tea B = 3 * 180 = Rs. 540\n    - Total cost of 5 kg of the mixture = Rs. 240 + Rs. 540 = Rs. 780\n    - Average cost of 1 kg of the mixture = Rs. 780 / 5 = Rs. 156\n\n2. **Calculating the Desired Selling Price:**\n    - Desired profit = 25% of the cost price = 0.25 * Rs. 156 = Rs. 39\n    - Desired selling price = cost price + profit = Rs. 156 + Rs. 39 = Rs. 195 per kg\n\n3. **Finding the Percentage of Tea A:**\n    - Let 'x' be the fraction of tea A in the mixture.\n    - Cost of 'x' kg of tea A = 120x \n    - Cost of (1-x) kg of tea B = 180(1-x)\n    - Total cost of the mixture (per kg): 120x + 180(1-x) = 180 - 60x\n    - Since the selling price is Rs. 200, we need to find the value of 'x' that gives us a profit of Rs. 39 (25%) on this cost.\n    - Profit = Selling price - Cost price = Rs. 200 - (180 - 60x) = 20 + 60x\n    - To get a 25% profit, this profit should be equal to Rs. 39: 20 + 60x = 39\n    - Solving for 'x': 60x = 19, so x = 19/60 = 0.3167 (approximately)\n    - Converting to percentage: 0.3167 * 100 = 31.67%\n\n4. **Rounding Off:**\n    - The answer should be rounded to the nearest whole number, making the final answer 32%.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is not listed in the options provided. The percentage of tea A in the mixture should be approximately 32% to achieve a 25% profit.**\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Profit is calculated on the cost price, not the selling price.**\n* **The selling price should be greater than the cost price to make a profit.**\n* **Ensure your calculations are accurate, especially when dealing with percentages.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **IBPS PO and SBI PO exams often test candidates' understanding of profit and loss calculations, including scenarios involving mixtures.**\n* **These exams also evaluate the ability to apply logical reasoning and problem-solving skills in a time-bound manner.**\n\n**For further practice:**\n\n* **Solve similar problems with different percentages of profit and varying costs of the ingredients.**\n* **Practice calculating the cost price and selling price of mixtures.**\n* **Familiarize yourself with the concepts of profit, loss, and percentage calculations.**\n\nBy understanding the principles of profit and loss calculations and applying them to various scenarios, you can confidently tackle similar questions in competitive banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Calculate the Marked Price (MP):**\n\n* We know the Selling Price (SP) after a 15% discount is $144.\n* This means the SP is 85% of the MP (100% - 15% discount).\n* Therefore, MP = SP / 0.85 = $144 / 0.85 = $169.41 (approximately).\n\n**2. Calculate the Revenue from the First 400 Handbags:**\n\n* Revenue = 400 handbags * $144/handbag = $57,600\n\n**3. Calculate the Revenue from the Remaining 100 Handbags:**\n\n* The discounted price for the remaining handbags is 90% of the MP (100% - 10% discount).\n* Discounted Price = 0.90 * $169.41 = $152.47 (approximately).\n* Revenue from the remaining handbags = 100 handbags * $152.47/handbag = $15,247.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Revenue:**\n\n* Total Revenue = $57,600 + $15,247 = $72,847\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Cost:**\n\n* Total Cost = 500 handbags * $120/handbag = $60,000\n\n**6. Calculate the Overall Profit:**\n\n* Overall Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $72,847 - $60,000 = $12,847\n\n**7. Calculate the Profit Percentage:**\n\n* Profit Percentage = (Profit / Total Cost) * 100% \n* Profit Percentage = ($12,847 / $60,000) * 100% = 21.41% (approximately)\n\n**Therefore, the wholesaler incurs an overall profit of approximately 21.41% on the entire batch of handbags.**\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Discounts are applied on the Marked Price (MP) not the Cost Price (CP).** \n* **Profit is calculated based on the Cost Price (CP), not the Marked Price (MP).**\n* **The problem involves multiple steps, so it's important to break it down logically.**\n\n**Why the provided solution is incorrect:**\n\nThe provided solution incorrectly calculates the profit percentage. It seems to have used the discounted price for the remaining 100 handbags as the selling price for the entire batch, leading to a lower profit percentage and a discrepancy in the answer.\n\n**Important Concepts for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Cost Price (CP):** The price at which an item is purchased.\n* **Selling Price (SP):** The price at which an item is sold.\n* **Marked Price (MP):** The price marked on an item, before any discounts.\n* **Profit:**  The difference between the Selling Price (SP) and the Cost Price (CP) when SP is greater than CP.\n* **Loss:** The difference between the Cost Price (CP) and the Selling Price (SP) when CP is greater than SP.\n* **Discount:** A reduction in the price of an item.\n* **Profit Percentage:** (Profit / Cost Price) * 100%\n* **Loss Percentage:** (Loss / Cost Price) * 100%\n\nUnderstanding these concepts and how they relate to each other is crucial for solving problems related to profit, loss, and discounts in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n",

This answer is closest to option **(C) $14,000**. Let's break down why this is the correct approach and why the other options are incorrect:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThis problem combines concepts of profit, revenue, and cost price. The key is to carefully analyze the given information and set up equations that represent the relationships between these variables.\n\n**Solution Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Defining Variables:** The solution correctly identifies the cost price of gadget B as 'x'. Since the cost price of gadget A is $100 less than gadget B, it is represented as 'x - $100'.\n\n2. **Calculating Revenue:** The revenue from each gadget is calculated by multiplying the number of units sold by the selling price. The selling price is calculated by adding the profit margin to the cost price. \n    * For gadget A: Revenue = 150 units * (x - $100) * 1.20 (1.20 represents a 20% profit margin)\n    * For gadget B: Revenue = 100 units * x * 1.30 (1.30 represents a 30% profit margin)\n\n3. **Total Revenue Equation:** The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from both gadgets, and it is given as $50,000. This forms an equation:\n    * $50,000 = 150(x - $100)(1.20) + 100(x)(1.30)\n\n4. **Solving for x:** The equation is simplified and solved for 'x', the cost price of gadget B, which comes out to be approximately $219.35.\n\n5. **Calculating Profit:** The profit for each gadget is calculated by multiplying the number of units sold by the profit margin per unit:\n    * Profit from Gadget A = 150 units * (x - $100) * 0.20 = $3,580.50\n    * Profit from Gadget B = 100 units * x * 0.30 = $6,580.50\n\n6. **Total Profit:** Finally, the total profit is the sum of the profits from both gadgets, resulting in approximately $10,161.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option (A) $10,000:** This is close to the actual profit, but slightly lower. \n* **Option (B) $12,000:** This is significantly lower than the actual profit.\n* **Option (D) $16,000:** This is much higher than the actual profit.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\n* **Understanding Profit and Loss:** This problem emphasizes the importance of understanding the concepts of cost price, selling price, profit margin, and their relationship with revenue and profit.\n* **Setting up Equations:**  The ability to translate word problems into mathematical equations is crucial for solving such problems.\n* **Solving for Variables:**  Practice solving equations involving multiple variables to quickly arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of problem is common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, which test your analytical and problem-solving skills. These exams often involve data interpretation and calculations related to profit and loss, interest rates, and other financial concepts. \n\n**Remember:**  Practice solving similar problems and focus on understanding the underlying concepts to ace these exams. \n",

This answer accurately calculates the present value of the loan payments by discounting each payment back to its present value using the formula for compound interest.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning behind the correct answer and why the other options are incorrect:\n\n**Understanding Present Value**\n\nPresent Value (PV) is the current worth of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows, given a specific rate of return. In this case, we're discounting the future loan payments back to their present value considering the 6% interest rate compounded quarterly.\n\n**Formula for Present Value**\n\nThe formula used to calculate the present value is:\n\n**PV = FV / (1 + r/n)^(nt)**\n\nWhere:\n\n* **PV:** Present Value\n* **FV:** Future Value (the amount to be received in the future)\n* **r:** Annual Interest Rate\n* **n:** Number of times interest is compounded per year (quarterly in this case, so n = 4)\n* **t:** Time in years\n\n**Calculation Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Payment 1:** $20,000 due in 1 year. \n   * PV = $20,000 / (1 + 0.06/4)^(4*1) = $18,867.92 \n\n2. **Payment 2:** $30,000 due in 2 years.\n   * PV = $30,000 / (1 + 0.06/4)^(4*2) = $26,656.95\n\n3. **Final Payment:** To calculate the final payment, we need to determine the remaining balance at the end of year 2. \n   * Balance at the end of year 2: $100,000*(1+0.06/4)^(4*2) - $20,000*(1+0.06/4)^4 - $30,000 = $93,314.77\n   * Final Payment: $93,314.77*(1+0.06/4)^4 = $104,350.78\n   * PV of Final Payment: $104,350.78 / (1 + 0.06/4)^(4*3) = $86,350.58\n\n4. **Total Present Value:** Adding the present values of all payments:\n   * $18,867.92 + $26,656.95 + $86,350.58 = $91,875.45\n\n**Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option (a) $94,200.00:** This answer might have resulted from a miscalculation in discounting the final payment or the initial loan amount. \n* **Option (c) $93,450.00:** This option likely did not account for the compounding of interest over the three-year period. \n* **Option (d) $90,560.00:**  This option seems to have used an incorrect interest rate or a different compounding frequency.\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* When calculating the present value of future payments, it's crucial to consider the time value of money. Money today is worth more than the same amount of money in the future due to the potential for earning interest.\n* The formula used to calculate present value is fundamental to financial planning and investment analysis.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **IBPS PO and SBI PO exams** focus on quantitative aptitude and reasoning, with questions related to finance, banking, and economics. Understanding present value is essential for these exams, as it is a core concept in financial calculations.\n* **Learning present value** is helpful not only for exams but also for making informed financial decisions in your personal and professional life. It helps you compare different investment options and understand the true cost of borrowing or lending money.\n\nThis detailed explanation should help you understand the concept of present value and apply it to solve similar problems in your exam preparation. \n",

We use this to project the company's earnings over the next three years.\n* **Projected EPS:**  With the projected net income and the assumption of a constant share count, we can project the future EPS.\n* **Projected Share Price:** Using the constant P/E ratio, we multiply the projected Year 3 EPS by the P/E ratio to arrive at an expected share price.\n\n**3.  Addressing the Missing Information: Dilution**\n\n* **The Missing Piece:** The question leaves out the number of new shares to be issued. This is crucial because issuing new shares dilutes the existing shareholder's ownership and can affect the market value per share.\n* **The Importance of Dilution:**  Without knowing the number of new shares, we cannot accurately calculate the impact on the share price. The answer provided in the original prompt (D. $98.75) assumes no significant dilution effect, but this is a critical assumption that needs to be acknowledged.\n\n**4.  Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams**\n\n* **Understanding the Concepts:**  You must be familiar with the fundamentals of EPS, dividends, P/E ratios, and how these factors influence market valuation.\n* **Recognizing Incomplete Information:** Be aware of missing information that might hinder a precise calculation. \n* **Applying Assumptions:** In situations where information is incomplete, you'll need to make reasonable assumptions and clearly state these assumptions.  \n* **Focus on the Process:** Even if you can't arrive at a precise answer, demonstrating your understanding of the concepts and the steps involved is crucial.\n\n**Practical Application for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams**\n\n* **Financial Analysis Questions:** Be prepared to solve problems that require you to analyze financial data, calculate ratios, and make projections.\n* **Situational Judgment:**  Recognize that real-world financial scenarios often involve missing or incomplete information.  You need to be able to assess the situation and make informed decisions based on available data. \n* **Logical Reasoning:**  Apply your logical reasoning skills to analyze financial information and make informed predictions. \n\n**Example Questions:**\n\n*  A company is planning a rights issue to raise capital. How will this affect the market value per share? \n*  A company has announced a dividend increase. How might this impact the company's P/E ratio?\n*  Explain the relationship between a company's earnings growth rate and its P/E ratio. \n\nBy understanding these concepts and the importance of complete information, you'll be well-prepared to tackle similar questions in your IBPS PO/SBI PO exams. \n",

            "question": "A trader buys two varieties of tea, A and B, at \u20b9150 per kg and \u20b9200 per kg respectively. He mixes them in a ratio of 4:3 and adds 20% of his own special blend of spices to the mixture. The cost of the spices per kg is \u20b9300. He then packages the final mixture into 1 kg packets and sells them at \u20b9250 per packet. If the trader wants to achieve a profit margin of 25% on the overall cost of the mixture (including the spices), what percentage of the mixture should he sell at a 10% discount to maximize his profit?",

            ],
            "correct_option": "c",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe provided solution correctly identifies that the trader should sell **30%** of the mixture at a 10% discount to maximize his profit. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning, emphasizing key concepts relevant to IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Mixture Cost:** The trader combines two different types of tea (A & B) at different prices, resulting in a mixed tea. This mix is further enhanced by adding spices. \n* **Profit Goal:** The trader aims for a 25% profit margin on the **entire** mixture, including the cost of spices. \n* **Dynamic Pricing:** The trader wants to maximize profit by strategically discounting a portion of the mixture.\n\n**2. Calculating the Cost of the Mixture:**\n\n* **Weighted Average:**  The cost price of the tea mixture is calculated using the weighted average method. The weights are the ratios in which the teas are mixed (4:3).\n* **Spice Inclusion:** The cost of the spices is added to the tea mixture's cost to arrive at the total cost price. \n* **Cost per KG:** This cost is divided by the total weight of the mixture (tea + spices) to get the cost per kg of the final mixture.\n\n**3. Determining the Target Selling Price:**\n\n* **Profit Margin:** The trader wants a 25% profit margin on the cost of the mixture. This means the selling price should be 125% of the cost price.\n\n**4. Strategizing the Discount:**\n\n* **Selling at a Discount:** The trader sells the mixture at \u20b9250 per packet, which is higher than the target selling price needed to achieve the 25% profit margin.  \n* **Discount Percentage:**  The difference between the actual selling price and the target selling price determines the discount percentage required to achieve the profit goal on the discounted portion.\n\n**5. Finding the Optimal Discount Percentage:**\n\n* **Profit Equation:** The solution sets up an equation to represent the total revenue from selling the mixture, considering both the discounted portion and the full-price portion. \n* **Solving for 'x':**  The equation is solved to determine the percentage (represented by 'x') of the mixture that needs to be sold at a 10% discount to achieve the desired profit margin. \n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Mixtures and Alligations:** This problem involves calculating the average cost of a mixture based on the individual costs and proportions of its components.\n* **Profit and Loss:** The problem focuses on calculating profit margin and determining the selling price needed to achieve a specific profit margin.\n* **Percentage Calculations:**  Understanding how to calculate percentages and apply them to different scenarios (like discounts) is crucial. \n\n**Importance for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Application of Concepts:** This type of question tests a candidate's ability to apply different mathematical concepts (percentages, averages, profit-loss) in a practical scenario.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** The solution requires logical reasoning to understand the problem, develop a strategy, and arrive at the correct answer.\n* **Data Interpretation:** The problem involves interpreting different pieces of information, such as costs, ratios, and profit targets.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThis question is a good example of a common problem type encountered in banking exams. By understanding the concepts involved and applying a step-by-step approach, candidates can develop the skills needed to tackle similar problems effectively. \n",
