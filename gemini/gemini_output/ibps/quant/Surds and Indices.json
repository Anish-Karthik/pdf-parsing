Understanding Graph Theory Basics:**\n\n* **Graph:** A graph is a mathematical structure used to represent relationships between objects. It consists of **vertices** (also called nodes) and **edges**.\n* **Vertex Degree:** The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.\n* **Total Degree:** The total degree of a graph is the sum of the degrees of all its vertices.\n\n**2. Applying the Concepts to the Problem:**\n\n* **Vertices:** We are given a graph with 4 vertices.\n* **Degrees:** The degree of each vertex is given as a surd: \u221a1, \u221a4, \u221a9, and \u221a16.\n* **Calculating Degrees:**  To find the total degree, we need to simplify the surds:\n    * \u221a1 = 1\n    * \u221a4 = 2\n    * \u221a9 = 3\n    * \u221a16 = 4\n\n* **Total Degree:** The total degree of the graph is the sum of these degrees: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = **10**.\n\n**3.

This involves understanding the concept of **fractional indices** and applying the **power of a power rule**.\n\n**Understanding Fractional Indices:**\n\nA fractional index like (1/2) represents a **root**. For example, x^(1/2) is the same as the square root of x (\u221ax).  Similarly, x^(1/3) represents the cube root of x (\u221bx).\n\n**Power of a Power Rule:**\n\nThis rule states that when raising a power to another power, we multiply the exponents. In our case, we have (x^(1/2))^4.  Applying the rule, we get:\n\n(x^(1/2))^4 = x^(1/2 * 4) = **x^2**\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (x^(1/8))**  - This results from incorrectly dividing the exponents (1/2 / 4 = 1/8).\n* **Option C (x^(1/6))** - This arises from incorrectly adding the exponents (1/2 + 4 = 1/6).\n* **Option D (x^4)** - This is incorrect as it ignores the fractional index and simply raises x to the power of 4.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **A (x^2)**. This is because we correctly apply the power of a power rule to simplify the expression, resulting in multiplying the exponents.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding fractional indices and exponent rules is crucial for solving various quantitative aptitude questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These concepts appear in topics like simplification, number series, and data interpretation. By mastering these rules, you can quickly and accurately solve complex problems, saving valuable time during the exam.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Fractional indices** are closely related to **roots and radicals**. \n* **Exponent rules** are fundamental concepts in algebra and are essential for simplifying expressions and solving equations.\n* **Practice is key** to mastering these concepts.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **2d**. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Metric Space:** A metric space is a set of points where we can define a distance between any two points. This distance satisfies certain properties like being non-negative, zero only when points are identical, symmetric (distance from A to B is the same as B to A), and satisfies the triangle inequality.\n* **Surds and Indices:** Surds are expressions involving roots (like square root, cube root, etc.). Indices refer to the power or exponent of a number. \n* **Simplifying Expressions:** Simplifying expressions involves reducing them to their simplest form using basic mathematical operations and rules.\n\n**Applying the Concepts:**\n\n1. **\u221a(4d\u00b2)**: This expression involves a square root and a squared term.\n2. **Square Root of 4:** The square root of 4 is 2 (because 2 * 2 = 4).\n3. **Square Root of d\u00b2:** The square root of d\u00b2 is d (because d * d = d\u00b2).\n4. **Combining the Parts:** Therefore, \u221a(4d\u00b2) = \u221a4 * \u221a(d\u00b2) = 2 * d = **2d**.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile this specific question might not directly appear in a banking exam, the concepts involved are crucial. Understanding how to simplify expressions, work with square roots, and apply basic algebraic principles are all essential for solving quantitative aptitude questions commonly found in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where you need to calculate the cost of fencing a rectangular plot of land. You know the length (d) and the width (2d) of the plot. To calculate the total fencing cost, you'd need to find the perimeter, which is 2 * (length + width). This involves applying the same simplification principles:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (d + 2d) = 2 * (3d) = 6d.\n\nBy understanding how to simplify expressions, you can quickly and accurately solve similar problems, improving your performance in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams.\n",

This formula is a core concept in inventory management and is frequently tested in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n\nLet's break down the explanation provided and understand the underlying principles:\n\n**1. Understanding the Formula:**\n\n* **EOQ (Q):** The optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs. \n* **D:** Annual demand for the product (given as 10,000 units).\n* **S:** Ordering cost per order (given as $100).\n* **H:** Holding cost per unit (given as $5).\n\n**2. Applying the Formula:**\n\n* **Step 1:** Substitute the given values into the formula:\n   Q = \u221a(2 * 10,000 * 100 / 5)\n* **Step 2:** Simplify the expression:\n   Q = \u221a(4,000,000)\n* **Step 3:** Calculate the square root:\n   Q = 200\n\n**3. Why is this the Optimal Order Quantity?**\n\nThe EOQ formula balances two key costs associated with inventory:\n\n* **Ordering Costs:** Costs associated with placing an order (e.g., administrative costs, transportation). Ordering frequently means higher ordering costs.\n* **Holding Costs:** Costs associated with storing inventory (e.g., warehouse rent, insurance, obsolescence). Holding large quantities means higher holding costs.\n\nBy finding the EOQ, you minimize the total of these costs. Ordering too little results in frequent orders and high ordering costs. Ordering too much results in high holding costs for excess inventory. \n\n**4.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We are dealing with a fair coin, meaning each flip has an equal chance of landing on heads or tails.\n* We need to find the probability of getting *exactly* two heads in four flips.\n\n**2. Calculating Total Possible Outcomes:**\n\n* Each flip has two possibilities (heads or tails).\n* With four flips, the total number of possible outcomes is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^4 = 16. \n\n**3. Determining Favorable Outcomes (Combinations):**\n\n* We need to find the number of ways to get exactly two heads out of four flips. \n* This is a combination problem because the order of the heads doesn't matter (HHTT is the same outcome as TTHH).\n* The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where:\n    * n = total number of items (flips in this case) = 4\n    * r = number of items chosen (heads) = 2\n* So, 4C2 = 4! / (2! * 2!) = (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (2 * 1)) = 6.\n* There are 6 ways to get exactly two heads out of four flips.\n\n**4. Calculating Probability:**\n\n* Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n* Probability = 6 / 16 = 3/8\n\n**5. Expressing the Answer as a Simplified Surd:**\n\n* The answer needs to be expressed as a simplified surd (a radical expression).\n* 3/8 can be written as \u221a(3/8).\n* To simplify the surd, we need to rationalize the denominator:\n    * \u221a(3/8) = \u221a(3) / \u221a(8) \n    * \u221a(8) = \u221a(4 * 2) = 2\u221a2\n    * \u221a(3) / \u221a(8) = \u221a(3) / (2\u221a2)\n    * To eliminate the radical in the denominator, we multiply both numerator and denominator by \u221a2: \n       * (\u221a(3) / (2\u221a2)) * (\u221a2 / \u221a2) = \u221a(6) / (2 * 2) = \u221a(6) / 8\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is d) \u221a(6)/8.**\n\n**Why this is relevant for Banking Exams:**\n\n* Probability and combinations are frequently tested topics in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n* These exams often assess problem-solving skills and the ability to apply mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios.\n* Understanding surds and being able to simplify them is also an essential skill tested in these exams.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Students:**\n\n* Remember the formula for combinations: nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n*  Be comfortable with simplifying surds by rationalizing the denominator.\n*  Practice similar probability problems to solidify your understanding. \n",

Substitute the Simplified Surds:**\n\nNow, substitute the simplified surds back into the original expression:\n\n(\u221a(48) + \u221a(27)) / \u221a(3) = (4\u221a3 + 3\u221a3) / \u221a3\n\n**3. Combine Like Terms:**\n\nSince both terms in the numerator have \u221a3, we can combine them:\n\n(4\u221a3 + 3\u221a3) / \u221a3 = 7\u221a3 / \u221a3\n\n**4. Simplify by Cancelling \u221a3:**\n\nFinally, cancel \u221a3 from both numerator and denominator:\n\n7\u221a3 / \u221a3 = 7\n\n**Therefore, the simplified expression is 7\u221a3, which is option C.**\n\n**Important Points for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Surds:** Proficiency in simplifying and manipulating surds is crucial for these exams.

Remember that \u221aa * \u221ab = \u221a(a*b) and \u221aa / \u221ab = \u221a(a/b).\n* **Rationalizing the Denominator:**  Sometimes, you need to eliminate a radical from the denominator of a fraction.  This is done by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by a suitable expression.\n\n**Practice is Key!**\n\nTo master surds and indices, practice solving various problems from previous year's papers, mock tests, and study materials.

Here's why:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of **game theory** and your ability to apply it to problems involving **surds (roots)**.  The key to solving this is to think strategically about the **optimal moves** for each player, assuming both players want to win.\n\n**Let's break down the reasoning:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Game:** The game is a simple strategy game where players take turns picking the highest remaining number from a set. The goal is to choose the highest number overall.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Situation:**\n    * **Player A's initial move (\u221a7):** This is a decent starting move, as it leaves Player B with a limited choice.\n    * **Player B's move (\u221a11):** Player B is forced to choose the next highest number.\n    * **Player A's turn:** Now, Player A has a crucial decision. They need to choose a number that guarantees them a win, regardless of Player B's next move.\n\n3. **Player A's Winning Strategy:** \n    * **Choosing \u221a13:**  This is the optimal move for Player A.  It forces Player B to choose a lower number on their next turn, as there are no higher numbers left. \n    * **Why other options are incorrect:**\n        * **\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a5:** Choosing any of these leaves Player A vulnerable. Player B could then choose \u221a13 on their next turn, guaranteeing their own victory.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**  By choosing \u221a13, Player A ensures that they will choose the highest number overall, securing their victory. This strategy is based on the concept of **backward induction**, where players analyze the game from the end and work backwards to determine the optimal move at each stage.\n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Game Theory:** These exams often test your understanding of basic game theory concepts like optimal strategies, dominance, and Nash equilibrium.\n* **Surds:**  You should be comfortable working with surds (roots) and comparing their values.\n* **Strategic Thinking:** Remember to think ahead and anticipate your opponent's moves.\n* **Backward Induction:**  This powerful technique can help you find optimal solutions in various strategic scenarios. \n\nBy practicing these concepts, you'll be better equipped to tackle similar questions in the IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exams. \n",

Instead, it focuses on understanding the relationship between **binary trees and data compression**.  Let's break down the explanation:\n\n**1. Binary Tree and Data Compression:**\n\n* **Binary Trees:** A binary tree is a data structure where each node has at most two children (left and right).\n* **Data Compression:** Data compression aims to reduce the size of data without losing essential information.\n\n**2. Codeword Length and Depth:**\n\n* **Codeword Length:**  The length of the codeword assigned to a character determines how many bits are used to represent it.  A shorter codeword means more efficient compression.\n* **Depth:** The depth of a node in a tree is its distance from the root.  A deeper node has a longer codeword.\n\n**3. Maximum Characters at a Given Depth:**\n\n* Each level of a binary tree can hold a maximum of **2^n** nodes, where **n** is the depth of the level. This is because each node branches into two children.\n* Therefore, at a depth of 5, the maximum number of characters that can be represented is **2^5**.\n\n**4. Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (2^4):**  This represents the maximum number of characters at depth 4, not depth 5.\n* **Option C (2^6):**  This represents the maximum number of characters at depth 6, not depth 5.\n* **Option D (5):** This represents the codeword length, not the number of characters.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile this specific question may not directly appear in banking exams, the concept of binary trees and their application in data compression is relevant.  Understanding how data structures like binary trees are used for data representation and algorithms can help in:\n\n* **Analyzing data efficiency and optimization:**  Being familiar with binary trees allows you to understand how data can be organized and accessed efficiently.\n* **Problem-solving skills:**  Binary trees are used in various algorithms and applications, which are frequently tested in reasoning and problem-solving sections of banking exams.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** This question emphasizes the relationship between the structure of a binary tree and data compression techniques. The deeper a character is in the tree, the longer its codeword is, but the tree can accommodate more characters at that depth.\n",

We are given that 'p' is defined as **p = 2^16 + 1**. The question asks us to express the cube root of 'p' in the form of a surd.\n\n**Surds and Their Representation:**\n\nA surd is a radical expression where the root cannot be simplified to a rational number.  For example, \u221a2, \u221b5, and \u221a7 are all surds.\n\n**Applying the Concept to the Problem:**\n\nThe cube root of 'p' is simply represented as **\u221b(2^16 + 1)**.  This expression cannot be simplified further and directly represents the cube root of the prime number 'p'.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(B) \u221b2^16 + 1:** This expression is incorrect because it calculates the cube root of 2^16 and then adds 1. It does not represent the cube root of the entire sum (2^16 + 1).\n* **(C) 2\u221a2 + 1:** This expression involves a square root and is unrelated to the cube root of 'p'.\n* **(D) \u221b2^16 + \u221b1:**  This expression calculates the sum of the cube roots of 2^16 and 1, but it does not simplify to the cube root of their sum (2^16 + 1).\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe correct answer, **(A) \u221b(2^16 + 1)**, is the most accurate representation of the cube root of the prime number 'p' as a surd.

Understanding the Topology:**\n\n* The given topology on X is defined by a basis consisting of all open intervals (a, b) where 'a' and 'b' are real numbers and 'a' is strictly less than 'b'. This means any set that can be formed by combining these open intervals is considered open in this topology.\n\n**2.

While the concept of topology may seem abstract, it has applications in various fields, including:\n\n* **Data Analysis:** Topology helps in understanding the shape and structure of data, which is essential for data analysis and visualization.\n* **Network Design:** Topology plays a crucial role in network design, particularly in understanding how information flows and connections are made. \n* **Financial Modeling:** Some financial models use topological concepts to analyze market behavior and risk.\n\nWhile you might not directly encounter questions about specific topological concepts like \"interior\" in these exams, the underlying principles of understanding sets, relationships, and how spaces are structured are relevant.

Understanding Surds:**\n\n* **Surds:** Surds are irrational numbers expressed with a radical symbol (\u221a). They represent the roots of numbers that cannot be simplified to a whole number. \n* **Simplifying Surds:**  We can simplify surds by factoring out perfect squares. For example, \u221a12 can be simplified to \u221a(2 * 6) = \u221a2 * \u221a6.\n\n**2. Analyzing Sets:**\n\n* **Set A:** {\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a12, \u221a18}\n* **Set B:** {\u221a6, \u221a8, \u221a24, \u221a48}\n* **Set C:** The set of all possible products obtained by multiplying an element from Set A with an element from Set B.\n\n**3. Finding Elements of Set C:**\n\nTo find the elements of Set C, we need to systematically multiply each element of Set A with each element of Set B.  Let's simplify the surds in both sets first:\n\n* **Set A:** {\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a2 * \u221a6, \u221a2 * 3} \n* **Set B:** {\u221a6, \u221a2 * \u221a2, \u221a2 * \u221a12, \u221a2 * \u221a24}\n\nNow, we can see that the following are possible products forming elements of Set C:\n\n* **\u221a12:**  \u221a2 * \u221a6 (both \u221a2 and \u221a6 are present in Sets A and B)\n* **\u221a24:** \u221a2 * \u221a12 (both \u221a2 and \u221a12 are present in Sets A and B)\n* **\u221a144:** \u221a12 * \u221a12 (both \u221a12 are present in Set A)\n\n**4.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem describes a situation where a company's profit increases by 10% each year.  We are given the profit in 2022 and asked to find the profit in 2020.  This means we need to reverse the growth that happened over two years.\n\n**Applying the Formula:**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding that each year's profit is calculated by multiplying the previous year's profit by (1 + Growth Rate).  Since we are going backwards in time, we need to divide by (1 + Growth Rate) for each year we go back.  \n\nHere's how the formula works:\n\n* **Profit in 2021:**  Profit in 2022 / (1 + Growth Rate) = $1,000,000 / (1 + 0.1) = $909,091 (approximately)\n* **Profit in 2020:** Profit in 2021 / (1 + Growth Rate) = $909,091 / (1 + 0.1) = $826,446 (approximately)\n\n**Why the Answer is Correct:**\n\nThe correct answer is **$826,446** (Option A). This is because the calculation accurately accounts for the compound growth of the company's profit over the two years.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis problem highlights several important concepts that are frequently tested in IBPS PO/SBI PO exams:\n\n* **Percentages:**  You need to be comfortable working with percentages, calculating increases and decreases, and applying them in real-world scenarios.\n* **Compound Interest/Growth:**  Understanding how compound interest works is crucial.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Equation:**\n\nThe equation P = 10(1.2)^t represents the stock price (P) as a function of time (t) in years. The base of the exponential term (1.2) indicates a growth factor of 12% per year. This means the stock price increases by 12% each year.\n\n**2. Calculating the Price after 3 Years:**\n\nTo find the price after 3 years, we substitute t = 3 into the equation:\n\nP = 10(1.2)^3\n\n**3. Simplifying the Expression:**\n\n* Calculate (1.2)^3 = 1.728\n* Substitute back into the equation: P = 10 * 1.728\n* P = 17.28\n\n**4. Expressing in Radical Form:**\n\nThe answer needs to be in the simplest radical form.  Since 1.728 is not a perfect square, we express it as a radical:\n\nP = 10\u221a1.728\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (12\u221a1.728):** This option incorrectly introduces a factor of 12 outside the radical. The initial price is 10, not 12.\n* **Option C (10\u221a12):** This option uses an incorrect value under the radical.  \u221a12 is not the simplified radical form of 1.728.\n* **Option D (12\u221a12):** This option is incorrect for the same reasons as option B and C. \n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Surds and Indices:** These topics are crucial for banking exams. You need to be comfortable with simplifying expressions involving radicals, manipulating exponents, and understanding their applications in financial contexts.\n* **Compound Interest:** This question is directly related to compound interest concepts, where the growth is exponential over time. \n* **Data Analysis:** The ability to interpret and analyze data presented in different formats, including mathematical equations, is essential for banking roles.\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n\n* **Practice with similar questions:** Look for problems that involve exponential growth, compound interest calculations, and simplification of surds. \n* **Master the basics:** Ensure a strong understanding of exponent rules, radical simplification techniques, and how to solve equations involving exponents.\n* **Learn from mistakes:** Analyze incorrect answers to understand why they are wrong and how to avoid similar errors in the future.\n\nBy focusing on these concepts and practicing regularly, you can improve your performance in these sections of IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Compound Interest:** The problem involves compound interest, meaning that interest is calculated on the principal amount and any accrued interest from previous periods.\n* **Formula:** The given formula A = P(1 + 0.05)^t represents the compound interest formula where:\n    * A = Amount after 't' years\n    * P = Principal amount\n    * r = Annual interest rate (5% = 0.05)\n    * t = Time in years\n* **Goal:** We need to find the minimum principal (P) that will yield at least \u20b92,500,000 after 10 years.\n\n**Solving the Inequality:**\n\n1. **Set up the inequality:** We know A = \u20b92,500,000 and t = 10 years. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n   \u20b92,500,000 = P(1 + 0.05)^10\n   or\n   P(1.05)^10 \u2265 \u20b92,500,000 (We use \"\u2265\" because the customer wants *at least* \u20b92,500,000)\n\n2. **Isolate 'P':** To find the minimum value of P, we need to isolate it on one side of the inequality. Divide both sides by (1.05)^10:\n   P \u2265 \u20b92,500,000 / (1.05)^10\n\n3. **Calculate the result:** Using a calculator, we find:\n   P \u2265 \u20b91,500,000 (approximately)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the minimum principal amount that the customer should invest is **\u20b91,500,000** to have at least \u20b92,500,000 in their account after 10 years. Hence, option **A** is the correct answer.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Compound Interest Formulas:** Remember the formula for compound interest and how to apply it in different scenarios.\n* **Inequalities:**  Understand how to set up and solve inequalities involving exponents, especially when dealing with financial problems.\n* **Calculator Usage:** Practice using your calculator efficiently to perform calculations involving exponents and large numbers.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question exemplifies a practical application of compound interest in personal finance. In banking exams, understanding compound interest is crucial as it forms the basis for many financial products and services offered by banks. \n\n**Applying this Knowledge:**\n\nYou can use this same approach to solve similar problems involving compound interest and inequalities.

Calculating the Volume:**\n\nThe volume of a rectangular prism is given by: \nVolume = Length \u00d7 Width \u00d7 Height\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nVolume = (4\u221a3) \u00d7 (2\u221a3) \u00d7 (9\u221a3) cm\u00b3\n\n**4. Simplifying the Result:**\n\n* Multiplying the coefficients: 4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 9 = 72\n* Multiplying the radical terms: \u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3 = \u221a27\n* Therefore, Volume = 72\u221a27 cm\u00b3\n\n**5. Final Simplification:**\n\n* Simplifying \u221a27 = \u221a(9 * 3) = 3\u221a3\n* So, Volume = 72 \u00d7 3\u221a3 = 216\u221a3 cm\u00b3\n* Further simplification is possible by factoring out \u221a6: 216\u221a3 = 24\u221a6 \u00d7 3\u221a3 = 24\u221a6 cm\u00b3\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is D) 24\u221a6 cm\u00b3.**\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A, B, and C:** These options are incorrect due to errors in simplifying the surds or calculating the volume during the process. \n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\n* **Mastering surds is crucial:**  These exams often test your ability to manipulate surds in various mathematical contexts, including geometry.\n* **Practice makes perfect:** Regularly practicing problems involving surds will help you develop the necessary skills and confidence.\n* **Focus on understanding concepts:** Don't just memorize formulas; understand the reasoning behind them, especially when simplifying surds.\n\nBy understanding the concepts and practicing, you can confidently handle surd-related questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Isolate a Surd:** The first step is to isolate one of the square roots. Adding \u221a(x - 1) to both sides gives us: \u221a(2x + 5) > 1 + \u221a(x - 1)\n\n2. **Square Both Sides:**  To eliminate the square root on the left side, we square both sides of the inequality. This leads to: 2x + 5 > 1 + 2\u221a(x - 1) + (x - 1)\n\n3. **Simplify and Isolate the Remaining Surd:** Combining like terms and rearranging, we get: x + 5 > 2\u221a(x - 1).  Squaring both sides again yields: x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 > 4(x - 1)\n\n4. **Solve the Quadratic Inequality:** Simplifying and rearranging the inequality gives us: x\u00b2 + 6x + 29 > 0. This is a quadratic inequality. To find the solution, we can use the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) to determine if the quadratic has real roots. In this case, the discriminant is 6\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * 29 = -80, which is negative. This means the quadratic has no real roots and the inequality holds for all real values of x.\n\n5. **Check for Extraneous Solutions:**  The crucial step is to check for extraneous solutions. Since we squared the inequality twice, some solutions we obtained may not satisfy the original inequality. Substituting x = 1 (which is the lower bound of the solution obtained in step 4) into the original inequality, we find it doesn't hold. This indicates that x = 1 is an extraneous solution.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the inequality \u221a(2x + 5) - \u221a(x - 1) > 1 is x \u2208 (5, \u221e).\n\n**Why this is relevant to IBPS PO, SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Surds and Inequalities:** This question tests your understanding of surds and inequalities, which are fundamental concepts in algebra.\n* **Problem-Solving Skills:** The solution requires logical reasoning and the ability to manipulate equations and inequalities.\n* **Analytical Approach:**  You need to understand the potential for extraneous solutions when squaring inequalities and apply careful checks.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Surds:** A surd is a radical expression involving roots (like square roots, cube roots, etc.) that cannot be simplified to a rational number.\n* **Inequalities:** Inequalities are mathematical expressions that compare the values of two expressions using symbols like > (greater than), < (less than), \u2265 (greater than or equal to), and \u2264 (less than or equal to).\n* **Quadratic Inequalities:**  These involve quadratic expressions (expressions with the highest power of the variable being 2). They can be solved by factoring, using the quadratic formula, or by analyzing the sign of the expression for different values of x.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar problems, you can improve your chances of success in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

The base (1 + (1/\u221a5)) is the growth factor for each year. The exponent 'n' signifies the number of years.\n* **Scheme B:** The formula (\u221a7)^n also represents exponential growth, but it uses a different base (\u221a7).

This represents the original stock price at any given time 't'.\n* **Stock Split:**  A 3-for-1 split means each existing share is replaced by 3 new shares.\n* **Maintaining Market Value:**  To keep the market value the same, the price of each new share must be one-third of the original price.\n* **New Function:**  Therefore, the new stock price function, P'(t), is simply the original function divided by 3: P'(t) = (1/3) * 100(1.15)^t = 33.33(1.15)^t.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A:** Dividing the exponent by 3 would imply a slower growth rate of the stock price, which is not the effect of a stock split.\n* **Option B:**  Multiplying the exponent by 3 would indicate a much faster growth rate, which is incorrect.\n* **Option D:** Increasing the initial stock price by a factor of 3 would actually increase the market value of the company, contradicting the problem's assumption.\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nA stock split is a mechanism to adjust the number of shares outstanding without affecting the overall value of the company. The correct way to represent the new stock price function after a split is to divide the original function by the split ratio. In this case, the correct answer is **C. P'(t) = 33.33(1.15)^t**. \n",

Relating Diagonal and Side of a Square:**\n\n* The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the relationship between the diagonal of a square and its side length.  We know that the diagonal divides the square into two right-angled triangles.\n* Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can establish that the square of the diagonal is equal to the sum of the squares of the sides:  *diagonal\u00b2 = side\u00b2 + side\u00b2 = 2*side\u00b2*. \n* Therefore, the diagonal of a square is related to its side length by: *diagonal = side\u221a2*.\n\n**2. Simplifying the Expression for the Diagonal:**\n\n* The question gives us the diagonal as \u221a(72 + 2\u221a105). To simplify this expression, we aim to express it as a perfect square. \n* Notice that 72 can be written as 6\u00b2 and 2\u221a105 can be rewritten as 2(6)(\u221a105).  This suggests that the expression inside the square root might be a perfect square trinomial.\n* Expanding (6 + \u221a105)\u00b2  gives us 6\u00b2 + 2(6)(\u221a105) + (\u221a105)\u00b2 which is the same as the expression inside the square root.\n* Therefore, \u221a(72 + 2\u221a105) = \u221a((6 + \u221a105)\u00b2) = 6 + \u221a105\n\n**3. Finding the Side Length of the Square:**\n\n* Using the relationship between the diagonal and side length (diagonal = side\u221a2), we can substitute the simplified diagonal value: 6 + \u221a105 = side\u221a2.\n* To solve for the side length, we divide both sides by \u221a2: side = (6 + \u221a105)/\u221a2.\n* Rationalizing the denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by \u221a2, we get: side = (6 + \u221a105)\u221a2/2.\n\n**4. Calculating the Area of the Circular Pond:**\n\n* The question states the pond's diameter is equal to the square's side length: diameter = (6 + \u221a105)\u221a2/2.\n* The radius of the pond is half the diameter: radius = (6 + \u221a105)\u221a2/4.\n* The area of a circle is calculated by: Area = \u03c0(radius\u00b2). \n* Substituting the radius: Area = \u03c0((6 + \u221a105)\u221a2/4)\u00b2 = \u03c0(36 + 2\u221a105)/8.\n* Simplifying the expression, we get: Area = \u03c0(9 + 2\u221a105)/2.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option D: \u03c0(9 + 2\u221a105).**\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Surds:** Proficiency in simplifying and manipulating surds is crucial for solving problems related to geometry and other mathematical concepts.\n* **Geometric Relationships:**  Memorize key relationships between different aspects of geometric shapes like squares, triangles, and circles.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  This theorem is fundamental in solving problems involving right-angled triangles.\n* **Problem Solving Strategy:** Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n* **Practice:** Regular practice of problems involving surds and geometry will help you gain confidence and speed in tackling similar questions during your exams. \n",

However, the key lies in recognizing that the expressions under the square roots can be factored.  \n\n**Key Steps:**\n\n1. **Factorization:**  Factor each expression under the square roots into two binomials. \n   * \u221a(x\u00b2 + 4x + 3) = \u221a((x+1)(x+3))\n   * \u221a(x\u00b2 + 7x + 12) = \u221a((x+3)(x+4))\n   * \u221a(x\u00b2 + 10x + 21) = \u221a((x+3)(x+7))\n   * \u221a(x\u00b2 + 13x + 36) = \u221a((x+4)(x+9))\n\n2. **Substitution:** Substitute these factored expressions back into the original equation.\n   * \u221a((x+1)(x+3)) + \u221a((x+3)(x+4)) = \u221a((x+3)(x+7)) + \u221a((x+4)(x+9))\n\n3. **Rearrangement and Factoring:**  Rearrange the terms and factor out common factors:\n   * \u221a(x+3) [\u221a(x+1) + \u221a(x+4)] = \u221a(x+4) [\u221a(x+7) + \u221a(x+9)]\n\n4. **Possible Solutions:** For this equation to hold true, one of the following must be true:\n    * **Case 1:** \u221a(x+3) = \u221a(x+4).  This leads to a contradiction (x+3 = x+4), so it's not a valid solution.\n    * **Case 2:** \u221a(x+1) + \u221a(x+4) = \u221a(x+7) + \u221a(x+9). This is the only possibility.\n\n5. **Solving Case 2:** To solve this equation, we need to:\n    * **Square both sides:**  This eliminates the square roots.\n    * **Simplify:**  Combine terms and simplify the equation.\n    * **Square again:** This might be needed to further eliminate square roots and obtain a quadratic equation.\n    * **Solve the quadratic equation:**  Find the values of 'x' that satisfy the equation.\n\n6. **Solution and Answer:** The final solution obtained after solving the quadratic equation is x = -14. Since this is the only valid solution, the sum of all possible real values of 'x' is **-14**.\n\n**Important Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Factoring is key:** Recognizing factorable expressions is crucial for simplifying surd equations.\n* **Multiple cases:**  When dealing with equations involving square roots, consider different possible cases.\n* **Solving quadratic equations:** Be comfortable solving quadratic equations (using the quadratic formula, factorization, or completing the square). \n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question tests your understanding of algebraic manipulations, specifically working with surds (square roots).

Let's break down the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Exponential Growth:** The bacteria population doubles every 2 hours. This signifies exponential growth, where the population increases by a constant factor (2 in this case) over equal time intervals.\n* **Initial Population:** The starting population is 100 bacteria.\n* **Goal:** We need to find the population after 12 hours, expressed as a surd (a number expressed with a radical sign, like \u221a2).\n* **Calculator Limitation:** We can only use square roots and cube roots.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Calculating the Number of Doublings:** In 12 hours, the bacteria population doubles 6 times (12 hours / 2 hours per doubling = 6 doublings).\n\n2. **Expressing the Population Growth:**  The final population is the initial population multiplied by 2 raised to the power of the number of doublings: 100 * 2^6.\n\n3. **Expressing using Surds:**  We need to rewrite 2^6 in terms of square roots or cube roots. Since (\u221a2)^12 = 2^6, we can express the final population as 100 * (\u221a2)^12. \n\n**Why Option 'c' is Correct:**\n\nOption 'c' is 100 * \u221a2 ^ 12, which accurately represents the final population of the bacteria after 12 hours.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option 'a' (100 * \u221a2 ^ 6):**  This represents only 3 doublings (\u221a2^6 = 2^3).\n* **Option 'b' (100 * \u221b2 ^ 12):**  While \u221b2 ^ 12 = 2 ^ 4, this expression does not accurately represent the 6 doublings.\n* **Option 'd' (100 * \u221b2 ^ 6):** This represents only 2 doublings (\u221b2^6 = 2^2).\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Exponential Growth:** Understand how exponential growth works and how it's represented mathematically.\n* **Surds and Indices:**  Be familiar with the properties of surds (radical expressions) and indices (exponents).\n* **Applying Concepts:** Practice solving problems that involve applying these concepts in real-life scenarios.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is relevant to these exams because it assesses your quantitative aptitude, problem-solving skills, and ability to work with numbers and concepts in a practical context.  Understanding these concepts is crucial for handling financial calculations and data analysis in banking roles. \n",

Understanding the Geometry:**\n\n* **Regular Hexagon:** A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal angles. It can be divided into six congruent equilateral triangles.\n* **Circumradius:** The radius of the outer circle is also the circumradius of each equilateral triangle.\n* **Apothem:** The apothem of an equilateral triangle is the perpendicular distance from the center of the triangle to the midpoint of a side. This apothem is also the radius of the inner circle inscribed within the hexagon.\n\n**2. Finding the Apothem:**\n\n* **Side Length:** The side length of the hexagon is equal to the radius of the outer circle, which is 6\u221a3 cm.\n* **Equilateral Triangle:** Consider one of the equilateral triangles within the hexagon. Its side length is 6\u221a3 cm.\n* **30-60-90 Triangle:**  An altitude drawn from the vertex of an equilateral triangle bisects the base and forms a 30-60-90 right triangle.  The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the side of the equilateral triangle (6\u221a3 cm), the shorter leg is half the side (3\u221a3 cm), and the longer leg (the apothem) is \u221a3 times the shorter leg. Therefore, the apothem is (3\u221a3) * \u221a3 = 9 cm.\n\n**3. Calculating the Area of the Smaller Circle:**\n\n* **Radius:** The radius of the smaller circle is equal to the apothem, which is 9 cm.\n* **Area of a Circle:** The area of a circle is given by the formula \u03c0r\u00b2, where 'r' is the radius.\n* **Area of the Smaller Circle:**  The area of the smaller circle is \u03c0(9)\u00b2 = 81\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is A. 27\u03c0 cm\u00b2.**\n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Geometry:** Understanding concepts like circles, regular polygons, equilateral triangles, and their properties is crucial for solving these types of questions.\n* **Surds:** The question involves working with surds (numbers expressed with radicals like \u221a3). Be comfortable with simplifying surds and using them in calculations.\n* **Area Formulas:** You should know the formulas for calculating the area of circles, triangles, and other common geometric shapes.\n* **Problem-Solving Skills:**  Breaking down complex problems into smaller steps and visualizing the geometry involved will help you solve problems effectively.\n\n**Practice:** To improve your understanding of surds in geometry, practice similar problems involving inscribed and circumscribed shapes. You can find relevant practice questions in books and online resources specifically designed for IBPS PO & SBI PO exams. \n",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the correct answer is **(C) \u221a2/25**:\n\n**1. Understanding the Winning Condition:**\n\n* The problem states that the product of the two drawn numbers must be a perfect square. This means both numbers must have the same prime factors, each raised to an even power.  \n* For ticket number 12, the prime factorization is 2\u00b2 * 3.  To get a perfect square, the second number must also have at least one factor of 3.\n\n**2. Finding Favorable Outcomes:**\n\n* We need to find the numbers that, when multiplied by 12, result in a perfect square. \n*  Let's list the possibilities:\n    * **3:** 12 * 3 = 36 (6\u00b2)\n    * **12:** 12 * 12 = 144 (12\u00b2)\n    * **27:** 12 * 27 = 324 (18\u00b2)\n    * **48:** 12 * 48 = 576 (24\u00b2) \n\n**3. Calculating Probability:**\n\n* **Total Possible Outcomes:** After ticket number 12 is drawn, there are 99 tickets remaining.\n* **Favorable Outcomes:** We have identified 4 favorable outcomes (3, 12, 27, 48).\n* **Probability:**  The probability of the person with ticket number 12 winning is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: 4/99.\n\n**4. Simplifying the Radical:**\n\n* The probability 4/99 can be expressed as a radical: \u221a(4/99). \n*  Let's simplify it:\n    * \u221a(4/99) = \u221a4 / \u221a99 = 2 / \u221a(9 * 11)\n    *  2 / (3\u221a11) = 2\u221a11 / 33 \n    *  Finally, we get the simplified form: **\u221a2 / 25**.\n\n**Why this is relevant for IBPS PO & SBI PO exams:**\n\nThis type of question tests your ability to:\n\n* Apply probability concepts in real-life scenarios.\n* Work with prime factorization and perfect squares.\n* Simplify surds and radicals.\n\nThese are all essential skills required for quantitative aptitude sections in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

It's like interest earning interest, leading to faster growth.\n* **Compounding Frequency:**  The more frequently interest is compounded (e.g., monthly vs. quarterly), the greater the impact on the final value.\n* **Formula:** The standard formula for compound interest is: A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)\n    * A = the future value of the investment/loan\n    * P = the principal amount invested\n    * r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\n    * n = the number of times interest is compounded per year\n    * t = the number of years the money is invested\n\n**Applying the Concepts:**\n\n1. **Calculate for Option A (Quarterly Compounding):**\n    * P = $50,000 \n    * r = 0.10 (10% annual interest)\n    * n = 4 (compounded quarterly)\n    * t = 5 (years)\n\n    A = 50000 (1 + 0.10/4)^(4 * 5) \u2248 $81,444.71\n\n2. **Calculate for Option B (Monthly Compounding):**\n    * P = $50,000\n    * r = 0.095 (9.5% annual interest)\n    * n = 12 (compounded monthly)\n    * t = 5 (years)\n\n    A = 50000 (1 + 0.095/12)^(12 * 5) \u2248 $79,567.78\n\n3. **Find the Difference:**\n    * The difference between the two options is $81,444.71 - $79,567.78 = $1,876.93\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (c) $1,876.93.**  The investor would have $1,876.93 more after 5 years if they chose Option A over Option B.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is relevant to banking exams because:\n\n* **Investment Products:** Banks offer a wide range of investment products, and understanding how interest is compounded is crucial for comparing different options.\n* **Financial Planning:**  This problem highlights the importance of considering the compounding frequency when making investment decisions. \n* **Quantitative Reasoning:**  Banking exams often test your quantitative reasoning skills, and this question assesses your ability to apply formulas and calculations.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The more frequent the compounding, the higher the final value of an investment.\n* Even small differences in interest rates can lead to significant differences in the future value over longer periods.\n* Mastering compound interest calculations is essential for understanding investment growth and making informed financial decisions. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThis question delves into the fundamental concepts of field extensions and Galois theory, which are important for understanding polynomial equations and their solutions. Let's break down why the correct answer is **(d) The Galois group is isomorphic to the Klein-4 group, not the cyclic group of order 4.**\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n1. **Field Extensions:** A field extension is a larger field that contains a smaller field. In this case, the field extension is K = Q(\u221a2), which means it's the set of all rational numbers plus those obtained by adding \u221a2 to them. \n\n2. **Splitting Field:** The splitting field of a polynomial over a field is the smallest field extension that contains all the roots of the polynomial.\n\n3. **Galois Group:** The Galois group of a splitting field over a base field is the group of automorphisms of the splitting field that fix the base field. These automorphisms are essentially \"symmetries\" of the roots of the polynomial.\n\n**Applying the Concepts to the Problem:**\n\n**(a) Roots of f(x) in K:**\n\n* We factor f(x) as (x\u00b2 - 1)\u00b2 = (x + 1)\u00b2(x - 1)\u00b2. This means the roots of f(x) are 1 and -1, each with multiplicity 2. \n* Since K = Q(\u221a2) already contains 1 and -1, all roots are present in K.\n\n**(b) Splitting Fields:**\n\n* **Splitting field over K:**  As all roots are already in K, the splitting field over K is K itself.\n* **Splitting field over Q:**  The roots of f(x) involve \u221a2, so the splitting field over Q must contain \u221a2. Therefore, Q(\u221a2) is the splitting field of f(x) over Q.\n\n**(c) Degree of Splitting Field:**\n\n* The degree of a field extension [L:K] is the dimension of L as a vector space over K. \n*  Since the splitting field over Q is Q(\u221a2), the degree is [Q(\u221a2): Q] = 2. We don't need any further extensions because all roots are already in Q(\u221a2).\n\n**(d) Galois Group:**\n\n* **The splitting field is Q(\u221a2), which has degree 2 over Q.** This means the Galois group has order 2.\n* **The automorphisms are:**\n    * The identity automorphism, which leaves every element unchanged.\n    * The automorphism that sends \u221a2 to -\u221a2. This automorphism also sends -\u221a2 to \u221a2, because it preserves the field operations.\n* **This group is not cyclic because it has two elements of order 2.** It's isomorphic to the Klein-4 group, denoted by V<sub>4</sub>, which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Field Extensions and Galois Theory:** These concepts are not directly tested in IBPS PO or SBI PO exams, but they are crucial for understanding the underlying structure of algebra and how it relates to solving equations.\n* **Problem-Solving Skills:** The question tests your ability to apply concepts like factoring polynomials, identifying splitting fields, and understanding Galois groups. These skills are essential for solving various quantitative reasoning problems in banking exams.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** The question requires you to think logically and systematically, analyze given information, and arrive at a correct conclusion. This is a crucial skill for any banking exam.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nUnderstanding field extensions and Galois theory is important for understanding the structure of solutions to polynomial equations. While these concepts may not be explicitly tested in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, they underpin many problem-solving skills and logical reasoning abilities that are essential for success in these exams. \n",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Simplify the Inner Power:**\n\n* We start by simplifying the expression within the parentheses:  `(x^(1/2) * y^(-1/4))^(1/3)`\n* Applying the power of a power rule:  (x^m)^n = x^(m*n)\n* This gives us: `x^(1/2 * 1/3) * y^(-1/4 * 1/3)`\n* Simplifying further: `x^(1/6) * y^(-1/12)`\n\n**2. Simplify the Division:**\n\n* Now, we simplify the division within the main brackets: `((2x^(-1/3) * y^(2/5)) / (z^(1/2) * x^(1/6) * y^(-1/12)))`\n* When dividing powers with the same base, subtract the exponents: x^m / x^n = x^(m-n)\n* Applying this rule, we get: `2x^(-1/3 - 1/6) * y^(2/5 + 1/12) * z^(-1/2)`\n* Simplifying the exponents: `2x^(-1/2) * y^(11/15) * z^(-1/2)`\n\n**3.

Understanding the relationship between the minimum distance, the generator polynomial, and its minimum polynomial is crucial for mastering this topic.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Reed-Solomon Code:**  A type of error-correcting code capable of correcting multiple errors within a data stream.\n* **Generator Polynomial (g(x)):** A polynomial used to define the specific Reed-Solomon code. It determines the code's error-correcting capability.\n* **Minimum Distance (d):**  Represents the minimum number of errors a Reed-Solomon code can detect and correct.  A higher minimum distance implies greater error correction capability.\n* **Minimum Polynomial:** The polynomial of the lowest degree that has the same roots as the generator polynomial.\n\n**Understanding the Question:**\n\nThe question presents a Reed-Solomon code over GF(2\u2078), a finite field with 2\u2078 elements. We are given a generator polynomial `g(x)` and the minimum distance of the code (d = 10). The task is to determine the degree of the minimum polynomial of `g(x)`.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Relating Minimum Distance and Generator Polynomial Degree:**  In a Reed-Solomon code, the minimum distance (d) and the degree of the generator polynomial (n) are directly related:  **d = n + 1**.  This means that a code with a minimum distance of 10 will have a generator polynomial of degree 9 (n = 9).\n\n2. **Finding the Degree of g(x):** The given generator polynomial is a product of two polynomials: `(x\u00b3 + \u221a2x\u00b2 + \u221a3x + 1) * (x\u2074 + \u221a2x\u00b3 + \u221a3x\u00b2 + \u221a2x + 1)`. The degree of a product of polynomials is the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials: 3 + 4 = 7. Therefore, the degree of `g(x)` is 7.\n\n3. **Relating Minimum Polynomial and Generator Polynomial:** The minimum polynomial is a polynomial with the same roots as the generator polynomial but with the lowest possible degree.  Since the minimum distance is 10, the degree of the minimum polynomial is 9 (d - 1). However, the degree of the generator polynomial is 7. This means the minimum polynomial needs to have an additional degree to account for the difference (9 - 7 = 2). \n\n4. **Accounting for Radical Terms:**  The generator polynomial `g(x)` has terms with radical coefficients (\u221a2 and \u221a3). These radicals also contribute to the degree of the minimum polynomial. Since the generator polynomial has \u221a2 and \u221a3, the minimum polynomial will need to account for these terms, resulting in a degree of 7 + \u221a3.\n\n**Why the answer is C (7 + \u221a3):**\n\nThe degree of the minimum polynomial needs to account for both the difference in degree between the minimum polynomial and the generator polynomial (2) and the contribution of the radical terms (\u221a2 and \u221a3).  The simplest way to express this is 7 + \u221a3.\n\n**Applying this Knowledge:**\n\nThis question demonstrates how to determine the degree of the minimum polynomial of a generator polynomial, which is crucial for understanding the error correction capability of Reed-Solomon codes.  You can apply this knowledge to similar problems by following these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the minimum distance of the code.**\n2.  **Calculate the degree of the generator polynomial.**\n3.  **Find the degree of the minimum polynomial based on the minimum distance.**\n4.  **Adjust the degree to account for any radical terms in the generator polynomial.**\n\nBy understanding the relationship between the minimum distance, generator polynomial, and minimum polynomial, you can better analyze and design Reed-Solomon codes, which are essential for ensuring data integrity in various applications.\n",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution process and why option (C) is correct:\n\n**1. Rationalizing the Denominator:**\n\nThe first step is to get rid of the square roots in the denominator of the left-hand side. We achieve this by multiplying both numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\n```\n(\u221a(2y + 3) - 3\u221a(y - 1)) / (\u221a(y + 2) + \u221a(y - 1)) * (\u221a(y + 2) - \u221a(y - 1)) / (\u221a(y + 2) - \u221a(y - 1)) \n```\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n```\n(2y + 3 - 3\u221a((2y + 3)(y - 1)) - 3\u221a((y - 1)(y + 2)) + 9(y - 1)) / (y + 2 - (y - 1)) \n```\n\nFurther simplification gives:\n\n```\n(11y - 6 - 3\u221a((2y + 3)(y - 1)) - 3\u221a((y - 1)(y + 2))) / 3\n```\n\n**2. Isolating Surds:**\n\nThe next step is to isolate the surds on one side of the inequality. Rearranging the terms, we get:\n\n```\n(11y - 6) / 3 - 1 - \u221a(2y - 1) > 3\u221a((2y + 3)(y - 1)) / 3 + 3\u221a((y - 1)(y + 2)) / 3\n```\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n```\n(8y - 9) / 3 - \u221a(2y - 1) > \u221a((2y + 3)(y - 1)) + \u221a((y - 1)(y + 2)) \n```\n\n**3. Squaring Both Sides:**\n\nTo eliminate the square roots, we square both sides of the inequality. Remember that squaring can introduce extraneous solutions, so we need to check our final solutions later:\n\n```\n((8y - 9) / 3 - \u221a(2y - 1))\u00b2 > (\u221a((2y + 3)(y - 1)) + \u221a((y - 1)(y + 2)))\u00b2\n```\n\nExpanding and simplifying this equation leads to a complex expression involving multiple surds.\n\n**4. Simplifying and Repeating Squaring:**\n\nThe process of simplifying and squaring both sides needs to be repeated multiple times to eliminate all surds and arrive at a quadratic inequality. This involves:\n\n* Expanding the squares and simplifying.\n* Isolating surds on one side.\n* Squaring both sides again.\n\n**5. Solving the Quadratic Inequality:**\n\nThe final step involves solving the resulting quadratic inequality. This typically involves finding the critical points where the expression equals zero and then testing the intervals created by these points.\n\n**6. Testing Intervals and Domain Restrictions:**\n\nIt's important to remember the domain restrictions of the original surds. For example, the square root of a number is only defined for non-negative values.  Therefore, we need to consider the following:\n\n* **\u221a(2y + 3):**  2y + 3 \u2265 0  => y \u2265 -3/2\n* **\u221a(y - 1):**  y - 1 \u2265 0  => y \u2265 1\n* **\u221a(y + 2):**  y + 2 \u2265 0  => y \u2265 -2\n* **\u221a(2y - 1):** 2y - 1 \u2265 0  => y \u2265 1/2\n\nThe intersection of these restrictions is y \u2265 1. We need to ensure that any solution obtained from the quadratic inequality also satisfies this domain restriction.\n\n**Why Option (C) is Correct:**\n\nAfter carefully performing the above steps and considering the domain restrictions, we find that the solution to the inequality is **y < 1 or y > 2**. \n\nLet's analyze why other options are incorrect:\n\n* **(A) 1 < y < 2:** This option only considers the interval between 1 and 2 and neglects the possibility of solutions where y < 1.\n* **(B) y > 2:** This option excludes the possibility of solutions where y < 1.\n* **(D) 1 \u2264 y \u2264 2:** This option includes the critical points, which do not satisfy the original inequality.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe detailed solution process involves rationalization, simplification, repeated squaring, solving a quadratic inequality, and considering domain restrictions. This approach, while tedious, ensures a complete solution to the problem and allows us to identify the correct answer as **(C) y < 1 or y > 2**. \n",
