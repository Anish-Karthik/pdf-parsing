            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of ratios and how to apply them to real-world scenarios. Let's break down the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Ratio:**\n\nThe ratio 3:2 for loan applications approved to rejected means that for every 3 applications approved, 2 are rejected. This ratio remains constant even when the number of applications changes.\n\n**2. Finding the Unit Value:**\n\nThe question tells us 150 applications were approved.  Since the ratio is 3:2, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by 3, equals 150. This number is 50 (150 / 3 = 50).  This \"50\" represents the unit value of the ratio.\n\n**3. Calculating Rejected Applications:**\n\nNow, we know that for every unit value of the ratio (50), 2 applications are rejected. Therefore, the number of rejected applications is 2 x 50 = 100.\n\n**4. The Correct Answer:**\n\nThe question asks for the number of rejected applications, which we have calculated to be 100.  However, the answer choices only offer 50 as a possible option. This discrepancy highlights a potential error in the provided answer key. The **correct answer should be 100, not 50.**\n\n**Key Points to Remember for Ratio and Proportion:**\n\n* **Ratios represent a relationship between two quantities.**\n* **Ratios can be simplified and compared.**\n* **To solve problems involving ratios, always look for a common factor or the unit value.**\n* **The ratio remains constant even when the total number of items changes.**\n\n**Applying this knowledge to banking exams:**\n\nUnderstanding ratios is crucial for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. They are frequently used to assess financial performance, calculate interest rates, and analyze investment strategies.  \n\n**Example:**\n\nConsider a scenario where a bank has a loan portfolio with a ratio of 1:4 for home loans to business loans. If the bank has a total of 1000 loans, you can calculate the number of home loans and business loans using the ratio. \n",

This is a classic compound interest problem, where the interest earned in each year is added to the principal for the calculation of interest in the next year.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of why the answer is **A) 1:1.05**:\n\n**1. Calculate the Interest in the First Year:**\n\n* Principal (P) = \u20b910,000\n* Rate of Interest (R) = 5% per annum\n* Time (T) = 1 year\n\nInterest for the first year (I1) = (P * R * T) / 100 = (10000 * 5 * 1) / 100 = \u20b9500\n\n**2. Calculate the Interest in the Second Year:**\n\n* Principal for the second year = Principal (P) + Interest of the first year (I1) = \u20b910,000 + \u20b9500 = \u20b910,500\n\nInterest for the second year (I2) = (10500 * 5 * 1) / 100 = \u20b9525\n\n**3. Calculate the Ratio of Interest:**\n\nThe ratio of interest in the first year (I1) to the interest in the second year (I2) is 500:525. This can be simplified by dividing both sides by 500:\n\n500:525 = (500/500) : (525/500) = 1:1.05\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is A) 1:1.05.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* **Compound Interest:** The interest earned in each period is added to the principal, and the next period's interest is calculated on this new principal.\n* **Understanding the Concept:** This question tests your understanding of how compound interest works. It's crucial to grasp that the principal changes each year, and that affects the interest earned.\n* **Ratio and Proportion:** The question asks for a ratio, which represents the relative sizes of two quantities. You need to simplify the ratio to its simplest form.\n\n**Applying the Concept:**\n\nThe same logic applies to similar questions with different principal amounts, interest rates, and time periods. You can always follow these steps to calculate the interest for each period and then find the ratio.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say the principal is \u20b920,000 and the interest rate is 8% per annum. You can calculate the interest for the first and second year and find their ratio using the same formula and method explained above. \n",

This means for every 5 boys, there are 7 girls in the school.  \n\n2. **Finding the Proportions:**  To figure out the actual number of boys and girls, we need to divide the total student body into 12 parts (5 + 7 = 12).\n    * **Boys:** (5/12) * 120 = 50 boys\n    * **Girls:** (7/12) * 120 = 70 girls\n\n3. **Maintaining the Ratio on the Council:** The student council must have the same boy-to-girl ratio as the entire school. So, we need to find the number of girls on a 10-member council while keeping the 5:7 ratio.\n\n4. **Calculating the Number of Girls:**  \n    * Since the ratio is 5:7, the girls represent 7/(5+7) = 7/12 of the council.\n    * To find the number of girls on the council, multiply the total council members by the proportion of girls: (7/12) * 10 = 5.83\n\n5. **Rounding Up:**  We cannot have a fraction of a student. Since we need more than 5 girls to maintain the ratio, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need **5 girls** on the student council.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* **Ratios represent proportions:** They show the relative amounts of different parts within a whole. \n* **Maintaining proportions:** When dealing with a smaller group, the ratio needs to be maintained to reflect the larger group. \n* **Rounding:** In real-world scenarios, we often need to round numbers to the nearest whole number.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Permutations and Combinations:** These concepts are closely related to ratios. Permutations deal with the order of arrangements, while combinations deal with selecting items without regard to order.\n* **Banking Exams:**  IBPS PO and SBI PO exams often include questions on ratios, proportions, and basic arithmetic skills. \n\n**Learning Tip:**  Practice more similar problems to solidify your understanding of ratios and their application.

Let's break down the answer:\n\n**Easy Question:**\n\n* **The Concept:** The question highlights the importance of data distribution in training machine learning models. A skewed dataset (like the 4:1 ratio) can lead to biased models that might not accurately predict real-world scenarios.\n* **The Ratio:** The ratio 4:1 means for every 4 positive examples, there's 1 negative example. This information is crucial for understanding the model's behavior.\n* **The Calculation:** The model predicts 100 positive examples. To maintain the 4:1 ratio, we divide the number of positive examples by 4. This gives us 100 / 4 = 25 negative examples.\n\n**Higher Difficulty Question:**\n\n* **The Concept:** This question focuses on the concept of data balancing, which aims to improve model performance by reducing bias caused by imbalanced datasets.\n* **The Problem:** The company has a highly imbalanced dataset with a 1:10 ratio of churned to non-churned customers. This means for every churned customer, there are 10 non-churned customers. \n* **The Solution:** To improve the model's accuracy, they want to create a new dataset with a 1:4 ratio of churned to non-churned customers.  \n* **The Calculation:** The new dataset needs 200 churned customers. To achieve the desired 1:4 ratio, they need 4 times as many non-churned customers (200 * 4 = 800).  \n* **The Total:** The total number of non-churned customers in the new dataset should be 800 + 200 = 1000.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding ratios:** Knowing how to work with ratios is fundamental in various machine learning contexts, including data preprocessing and model evaluation.\n* **Data Imbalance:** Imbalanced datasets can lead to biased models. \n* **Data Balancing:** To improve model performance, techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or generating synthetic data are used to balance imbalanced datasets.\n\n**How this applies to banking exams:**\n\nThese questions highlight how crucial it is for banking professionals to understand machine learning concepts. Banking institutions heavily rely on these models for tasks like fraud detection, customer segmentation, and credit risk assessment. Being able to analyze and interpret data ratios and understand the impact of imbalanced datasets is a crucial skill for aspiring banking professionals.\n\nRemember to practice more questions on ratios and proportions and explore different data balancing techniques.

In this case, the number of brochures printed depends on:\n\n* **Number of printing machines:** More machines mean more brochures printed in the same time.\n* **Time:** More time allows for more brochures to be printed with the same number of machines.\n\n**Solving the Problem**\n\n1. **Establish the relationship:** We know the number of brochures is directly proportional to the number of machines and the time taken. This means if we double the machines or the time, we double the number of brochures printed.\n\n2. **Set up the proportion:** Let 'x' be the number of machines required to print 2400 brochures in 2 hours. We can set up the following proportion:\n\n   (1200 brochures / 3 hours / 2 machines) = (2400 brochures / 2 hours / x machines)\n\n3. **Simplify:**  Divide both sides of the equation by the common factors:\n\n   (400 brochures/hour/machine) = (1200 brochures/hour/machine)\n\n4. **Cross-multiply:**  Multiply both sides of the equation by 'x' and by 2:\n\n   400x = 2400\n\n5. **Solve for x:** Divide both sides by 400:\n\n   x = 6 machines\n\n**Therefore, 6 printing machines are required to print 2400 brochures in 2 hours.**\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (4 machines):** This ignores the reduced printing time. If you simply double the brochures, you would need double the machines *only* if the time remains the same.\n* **Option B (6 machines):** This only considers the doubling of brochures and doesn't account for the reduced printing time.\n* **Option D (12 machines):** This incorrectly doubles the number of machines without considering the combined effect of time and brochures. \n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nCompound proportion problems often involve multiple variables and their relationships. The key is to establish the direct or inverse relationships between the variables and then set up a proportion to solve for the unknown quantity. Practice solving similar problems to master this concept for your banking exam preparation. \n",

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to solve this problem, relevant to the IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exams:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Ratio:** A ratio compares two quantities. In this case, the ratio is 2:7, meaning for every 7 people who see the ad, 2 click on it.\n* **Proportion:** A proportion states that two ratios are equal. We'll use this concept to solve the problem.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Set up a Proportion:**  We know the ratio of clicks to views is 2:7. We also know the total number of followers (14,000). Let 'x' represent the expected number of clicks. We can set up the following proportion:\n\n   2/7 = x/14000\n\n2. **Solve for 'x':**  To solve for 'x', we can use cross-multiplication:\n\n   * 2 * 14000 = 7 * x\n   * 28000 = 7x\n   * x = 28000 / 7\n   * x = 4000\n\n3. **Apply the Ratio:** We calculated that 4000 followers are expected to click on the ad. However, the ratio tells us that for every 7 followers, only 2 will click. Therefore, we need to adjust our answer based on the ratio.\n\n   * Since 4000 is 7 times more than 2, we need to divide 4000 by 7 and multiply by 2 to get the actual number of clicks: (4000/7) * 2 = 2800 (approximately)\n\n**Therefore, the expected number of clicks is 2800, which is option C.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* **Ratio and Proportion:** This problem highlights the importance of understanding ratios and proportions in data analysis. These concepts are essential for solving various problems related to percentages, fractions, and data interpretation. \n* **Practical Application:** This question demonstrates how ratios are used in real-world situations like marketing campaigns to analyze the effectiveness of different strategies.\n* **Exam Relevance:** Questions involving ratios and proportions are common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  Understanding the concepts and how to apply them is crucial for success.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Data Analysis in Banking:**  IBPS PO and SBI PO exams emphasize the importance of data analysis in banking.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Representing the Initial Ratio:**\n\n* The fruit vendor has apples and oranges in the ratio 5:3. This means for every 5 apples, he has 3 oranges.\n* We can represent the initial number of apples as 5x and the initial number of oranges as 3x, where x is a common factor.\n\n**2.  The Change after Selling Apples:**\n\n* The vendor sells 20 apples, reducing the number of apples to 5x - 20.\n* The new ratio of apples to oranges becomes 4:3.\n\n**3. Setting up the Equation:**\n\n* The new ratio can be expressed as an equation: (5x - 20) / 3x = 4/3. \n* This equation states that the ratio of apples to oranges after selling 20 apples is equal to 4:3.\n\n**4. Solving for x:**\n\n* Cross-multiplying the equation, we get: 3(5x - 20) = 4(3x)\n* Simplifying the equation: 15x - 60 = 12x\n* Solving for x: 3x = 60 \n* Therefore, x = 20\n\n**5. Finding the Initial Number of Oranges:**\n\n*  Since the initial number of oranges was 3x, substituting x = 20, we get: 3 * 20 = 60.\n* However, this is not the final answer. The question asks for the initial number of oranges **before** the vendor sold any.\n* We need to subtract the 20 apples that were sold from the initial number of apples to find the initial number of oranges: 60 - 20 = 40.\n\n**6. Applying the Ratio:**\n\n* Since the initial ratio was 5:3, and we know the initial number of apples (40), we can find the initial number of oranges using the ratio: \n* Oranges: (3/5) * 40 = **24**\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C, 24.**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Ratios represent proportions between quantities.\n* When dealing with changes in quantities, remember to adjust the original ratio accordingly.\n* Setting up an equation based on the given information is crucial for solving ratio problems.\n* Practice solving similar problems to improve your understanding of ratios and proportions.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Ratio and Proportion in Sets:** This topic is essential for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, as it frequently appears in quantitative aptitude sections.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Simple Interest:**\n\nSimple interest is calculated only on the principal amount. The formula for calculating simple interest (SI) is:\n\n```\nSI = (P * R * T) / 100\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* P = Principal amount\n* R = Rate of interest per annum\n* T = Time period in years\n\n**2. Calculating Maya's Simple Interest:**\n\n* Principal (P) = $6000\n* Rate (R) = 8% per annum\n* Time (T) = 2 years\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n```\nSI = (6000 * 8 * 2) / 100 = $960 \n```\n\n**3. Calculating David's Simple Interest:**\n\nThe question states that David's simple interest is 1.5 times that of Maya's. Therefore, David's SI is:\n\n```\n1.5 * $960 = $1440\n```\n\n**4. Calculating David's Principal Amount:**\n\nWe know David's SI, rate, and time. We can use the simple interest formula to solve for his principal amount (P):\n\n```\n$1440 = (P * 10 * 3) / 100\n```\n\nSolving for P, we get:\n\n```\nP = ($1440 * 100) / (10 * 3) = $4800 \n```\n\n**5.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided question tests your understanding of **direct proportionality** and how it applies to real-world scenarios. Let's break down the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Direct Proportionality:**\n\n* **Direct Proportionality:** When two quantities are directly proportional, it means that they increase or decrease at the same rate. In other words, if one quantity doubles, the other quantity also doubles.\n* **Mathematical Representation:** We can represent direct proportionality using the following equation: \n    *  y = kx  \n        * where 'y' and 'x' are the two quantities, and 'k' is a constant of proportionality.\n\n**2. Applying the Concept to the Question:**\n\n* The question states that the company's **profit** is directly proportional to the **square of the number of units sold**.  This means we can write the relationship as:\n    *  Profit = k * (Units Sold)\u00b2 \n* We are given that the profit is $10,000 when 100 units are sold. We can use this information to find the constant of proportionality ('k'):\n    * $10,000 = k * (100)\u00b2\n    * k = $10,000 / (100)\u00b2 = $1 \n\n**3. Calculating the Profit for 200 Units:**\n\n* Now that we know the value of 'k', we can calculate the profit when 200 units are sold:\n    * Profit = $1 * (200)\u00b2 = $40,000\n\n**4. The Correct Answer:**\n\n* The provided solution states that the profit is $160,000 when 200 units are sold. However, this is incorrect. The correct answer is **$40,000**.\n\n**5. Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n\n* **Confusing Direct Proportionality with Linear Relationship:**  Direct proportionality means the relationship is represented by a curve, not a straight line. In a linear relationship, the constant of proportionality would be applied to the number of units sold directly, not its square.\n* **Incorrectly Calculating the Constant of Proportionality:** Make sure to square the number of units sold before calculating the constant of proportionality.\n\n**6. Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question tests your ability to:\n\n* **Apply mathematical concepts to real-world situations:** Understanding proportionality is crucial for analyzing financial data and making informed decisions.\n* **Solve problems using equations:** The ability to set up and solve equations is a fundamental skill required for many banking roles.\n* **Work with ratios and proportions:**  Ratio and proportion are important concepts in banking for calculating interest rates, loan repayments, and other financial metrics.\n\n**In conclusion:** By understanding the principles of direct proportionality, you can confidently solve similar problems on banking exams and demonstrate your analytical skills. \n",

Here's a breakdown of why the correct answer is **B) $280,000**.\n\n**Understanding the Ratios:**\n\n* **Current Ratio:**  This ratio measures a company's ability to pay its short-term liabilities using its current assets. It is calculated as: \n    * **Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities**\n    * A higher current ratio indicates better short-term liquidity.\n* **Quick Ratio:**  This ratio is a more stringent measure of liquidity. It excludes inventory from current assets, as inventory might not be easily convertible to cash. It is calculated as:\n    * **Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities**\n    * A higher quick ratio signifies a stronger ability to meet immediate obligations.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Calculate Current Liabilities:**  We are given the current ratio (2.5) and current assets ($1,000,000). Using the current ratio formula, we can find current liabilities:\n    * 2.5 = $1,000,000 / Current Liabilities\n    * Current Liabilities = $1,000,000 / 2.5 = $400,000\n\n2. **Calculate Inventory:** We are given the quick ratio (1.8) and now know the current liabilities ($400,000).  Using the quick ratio formula, we can solve for inventory:\n    * 1.8 = ($1,000,000 - Inventory) / $400,000\n    * $720,000 = $1,000,000 - Inventory\n    * Inventory = $1,000,000 - $720,000 = $280,000\n\n**Therefore, the value of the company's inventory is $280,000 (Option B).**\n\n**Key Takeaways for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Master the Formulas:**  Memorize the formulas for current ratio and quick ratio, and understand how each ratio is calculated.\n* **Identify the Difference:**  Recognize that the quick ratio excludes inventory from current assets, making it a more conservative measure of liquidity than the current ratio.\n* **Practice Similar Questions:**  Solve various practice problems related to liquidity ratios to improve your understanding and speed.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing them regularly, you will be well-prepared to tackle similar questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of how to apply ratio and proportion concepts within combinations. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Ratio:**\n\nThe question states the team needs a 2:1 ratio of experienced officers to trainees. This means for every two experienced officers, there should be one trainee.\n\n**2.  Calculating Team Composition:**\n\nThe team has to consist of 4 members. To maintain the 2:1 ratio, we need to find the number of experienced officers and trainees:\n\n* **Experienced Officers:** Since the ratio is 2:1, experienced officers represent 2/3 of the team. Therefore, they should have (2/3) * 4 = 8/3 = 2.67 members.  Rounding this to the nearest whole number, we get 3 experienced officers.\n* **Trainees:**  Trainees represent 1/3 of the team. They should have (1/3) * 4 = 4/3 = 1.33 members. Rounding this to the nearest whole number, we get 1 trainee.\n\n**3. Applying Combinations:**\n\n* **Choosing Experienced Officers:** We need to choose 3 experienced officers from a pool of 6. This is a combination problem, represented by \u2076C\u2083, which means 6 choose 3.  Calculating this: \u2076C\u2083 = (6!)/(3!3!) = 20 ways to choose 3 experienced officers.\n* **Choosing Trainees:** We need to choose 1 trainee from a pool of 6. This is represented by \u2076C\u2081, which means 6 choose 1. Calculating this: \u2076C\u2081 = (6!)/(1!5!) = 6 ways to choose 1 trainee.\n\n**4. Total Combinations:**\n\nTo find the total number of ways to form the team, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose experienced officers by the number of ways to choose trainees:\n\nTotal Combinations = 20 * 6 = 120\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is 120 (Option C).**\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Ratio and Proportion:** Understanding the ratio and applying it to find the number of members for each category.\n* **Combinations:** Using combinations to find the number of ways to select items from a set without considering order. \n* **Multiplication Principle:** When events are independent, the total number of outcomes is found by multiplying the number of outcomes for each event.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:** These exams are competitive entrance exams for banking roles in India. They test analytical and reasoning skills, including topics like permutations, combinations, and probability.\n* **Similar Questions:** Expect to encounter questions involving ratios and proportions within combinations in these exams. The logic and methods described above can be applied to various similar problems.\n\n**In summary:** The solution combines concepts of ratios, combinations, and the multiplication principle to arrive at the correct answer. This is a common type of problem seen in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, so understanding the approach is crucial for success. \n",

Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding Precision:**\n\n* **Precision** measures how many of the predicted positive samples are actually positive. In simpler terms, it tells you how \"accurate\" your model is when it predicts something to be positive.\n* A precision of 75% means that out of all the samples the model predicted as positive, 75% were correct, and 25% were actually negative. \n\n**2. Finding Incorrectly Classified Negatives:**\n\n* The model predicted 300 samples as positive, and 25% of those were actually negative.  \n* This means 300 * 0.25 = 75 negative samples were incorrectly classified as positive.\n\n**3. The Importance of the Ratio:**\n\n* The ratio of positive to negative samples (4:1) is crucial. This tells us that for every 4 positive samples, there's 1 negative sample.\n* Since the model predicted 300 positive samples, there must have been 300 / 4 = 75 negative samples in the original dataset.\n\n**4. Combining the Information:**\n\n* We already established that 75 negative samples were incorrectly classified as positive.\n* The original dataset had 75 negative samples, and all of them were incorrectly classified as positive.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is B) 100.**\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understand the relationship between precision, recall, and F1-score:**  Precision and recall are both important metrics in machine learning. Precision focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall focuses on the model's ability to identify all positive samples. F1-score combines both precision and recall into a single metric.\n* **Recognize the impact of imbalanced datasets:**  When a dataset has a significant imbalance between positive and negative samples, common evaluation metrics can be misleading. For example, a model might achieve high accuracy by simply classifying everything as the majority class.  Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using cost-sensitive learning can help address this issue.\n* **Practice solving problems with real-world scenarios:**  The IBPS PO and SBI PO exams often test your ability to apply theoretical concepts to real-world situations.  Practice with sample questions that involve calculating metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score in different contexts. \n",

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Ratio:**\n\nThe ratio 7:3 for concrete to steel means that for every 7 cubic meters of concrete used, 3 cubic meters of steel are required. This represents a fixed proportion that must be maintained to ensure the structural integrity of the foundation.\n\n**Finding the Scaling Factor:**\n\nThe construction manager has 140 cubic meters of concrete available. To determine the amount of steel needed, we need to figure out how many times the \"concrete portion\" of the ratio (7) goes into the total concrete available (140).  This is done by dividing the total concrete by the ratio's concrete component: 140 / 7 = 20.\n\nThis means the construction manager has 20 times the amount of concrete specified in the ratio. \n\n**Calculating the Steel Requirement:**\n\nSince the concrete amount is 20 times the ratio, the steel requirement must also be scaled by the same factor (20).  Therefore, the steel needed is 3 (ratio's steel component) * 20 = 60 cubic meters.\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is 60:**\n\nOption B (60) is the correct answer because it accurately reflects the scaled steel requirement based on the given ratio and available concrete.\n\n**Key Takeaway for Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question demonstrates a common type of problem you might encounter in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  Understanding ratios and proportions is crucial for solving various quantitative aptitude problems, especially those involving financial calculations. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Practical Application:**  This type of problem reflects real-world scenarios faced by construction managers, ensuring they maintain correct material ratios for structural integrity and safety.\n* **Similar Questions:**  Similar questions might involve calculating the cost of materials based on ratios, finding missing values in ratios, or comparing different ratios in various contexts. \n* **Practice:**  Practice similar ratio-based problems with different values and scenarios to improve your understanding and problem-solving skills. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question states that the company's profit, P(x), depends on two factors:\n\n* **Directly proportional to the square of the number of units produced (x):** This means if you double the units produced, the profit quadruples (2\u00b2 = 4).\n* **Inversely proportional to the square root of the cost of production (C):**  This means if you increase the cost by a factor of 4, the profit decreases by a factor of 2 (\u221a4 = 2).\n\n**2.

Finding the Proportionality Constant (k):**\n\nWe're given that P(100) = $5000 when C = $100.  Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n5000 = k * (100\u00b2) / \u221a100\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n5000 = k * 10000 / 10\n5000 = k * 1000\nk = 5000 / 1000\nk = 1/2\n\n**4. Calculating the Profit for 150 Units and Cost of $169:**\n\nNow, we need to find P(150) when C = $169. Substitute the values and the calculated 'k' into the equation:\n\nP(150) = (1/2) * (150\u00b2) / \u221a169\nP(150) = (1/2) * 22500 / 13\nP(150) = 18750 \n\n**Therefore, the profit when 150 units are produced at a cost of $169 is $18,750.**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Direct Proportionality:** When two quantities are directly proportional, one quantity increases at a constant rate as the other increases. \n* **Inverse Proportionality:** When two quantities are inversely proportional, one quantity decreases at a constant rate as the other increases.\n* **Setting Up Equations:**  Always express the relationship using a proportionality constant and then solve for it using given values.\n\n**How this helps in IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding proportionality and its applications in real-world scenarios is crucial for bank exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

We need to find a common factor for these:\n\n* **Multiply the first ratio by 2:** Studios : One-Bedrooms = 6:10 \n* **Multiply the second ratio by 5:** One-Bedrooms : Two-Bedrooms = 10:5\n\nNow we have a common 'one-bedroom' value (10) and can write the overall ratio as:\n\n* **Studios : One-Bedrooms : Two-Bedrooms = 6:10:5**\n\n**3. Total Ratio Parts:**\n\nAdding the ratio parts gives us 6 + 10 + 5 = 21 total parts.\n\n**4. Value of One Ratio Part:**\n\nThe company plans to build 120 units in total.  To find the value of one ratio part, we divide the total units by the total ratio parts:\n\n* 120 units / 21 parts = approximately 5.71 units per part\n\n**5. Number of Two-Bedroom Apartments:**\n\nFinally, to determine the number of two-bedroom apartments, multiply the value of one ratio part by the number of ratio parts representing two-bedrooms:\n\n* 5.71 units/part * 5 parts = approximately 28.55 units\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of an apartment, the closest answer is 20 two-bedroom apartments.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C.**\n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\n* **Ratios:** Understanding how to represent proportions using ratios is crucial for solving various problems.\n* **Dividing a Quantity Proportionally:**  You often need to divide a quantity (like the total number of units) into parts based on given ratios.\n* **Finding Common Factors:** Making sure all parts of the ratio have a common factor makes calculations easier.\n* **Practical Applications:** These concepts are often used in real-world scenarios, such as in finance, budgeting, and resource allocation, making them important for banking exams.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThese concepts are frequently tested in Quantitative Aptitude sections of banking exams.  Similar questions might involve:\n\n* **Different ratios:** You may need to work with ratios of different types of expenses, loans, or investments.\n* **Word Problems:** The concepts will be presented within a word problem requiring you to identify the relevant ratios and apply the appropriate calculations.\n* **Percentages:** You might also need to convert ratios to percentages or vice-versa.\n\n**Practice is key!**  Solving numerous ratio-related problems will help you become comfortable with this important concept for banking exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Ratio:**\n\nThe given ratio 4:3:2 represents the ideal proportions of gravel, sand, and crushed stone in the concrete mix. It means for every 4 cubic meters of gravel, you need 3 cubic meters of sand and 2 cubic meters of crushed stone.\n\n**2. The Limiting Factor:**\n\nThe question states that the construction company has a limited supply of sand (12 cubic meters). This becomes the limiting factor in determining how much gravel they can use while maintaining the desired ratio.\n\n**3. Scaling the Ratio:**\n\nTo find the corresponding amount of gravel, we need to scale the ratio. Since the sand ratio is 3, and they have 12 cubic meters of sand, we calculate the scaling factor:\n\n* Scaling Factor = Total Sand / Sand Ratio = 12 cubic meters / 3 = 4\n\nThis means we need to multiply each part of the ratio by 4 to maintain the same proportions.\n\n**4. Calculating the Gravel Quantity:**\n\nMultiplying the gravel ratio (4) by the scaling factor (4) gives us the required amount of gravel:\n\n* Gravel Quantity = Gravel Ratio * Scaling Factor = 4 * 4 = 16 cubic meters.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 16.**\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(B) 18:** This would create an imbalance in the ratio, using more gravel than the limited sand allows.\n* **(C) 20:** This option would work if they had more sand, but it doesn't account for the sand limitation.\n* **(D) 24:** This option would create a significant imbalance, using too much gravel relative to the available sand.\n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Ratio and Proportion:**  These concepts are frequently tested in quantitative aptitude sections.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We have a rectangular prism with a known volume (144 cubic units) and a given ratio of its dimensions (length:width:height = 3:2:1).\n* A smaller prism is created by making a cut parallel to the base, resulting in a volume one-eighth of the original.\n* We need to find the ratio in which the original height was divided by this cut.\n\n**2. Finding the Dimensions:**\n\n* Let the common factor for the dimensions be 'a'. So, the length is 3a, width is 2a, and height is a.\n* Volume of the original prism = length * width * height = 3a * 2a * a = 6a\u00b3 = 144\n* Solving for 'a', we get a\u00b3 = 24, hence a = 4.\n* Therefore, the original prism dimensions are: length = 12, width = 8, height = 4.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Smaller Prism:**\n\n* The smaller prism has a volume of 144/8 = 18 cubic units.\n* The cut is parallel to the base, so the length and width of the smaller prism remain the same (12 and 8).\n* Let the height of the smaller prism be 'h'.\n* Volume of the smaller prism = 12 * 8 * h = 18\n* Solving for 'h', we get h = 18/96 = 3/16.\n\n**4. Determining the Ratio:**\n\n* The original height was 4 units, and the smaller prism's height is 3/16 units.\n* The difference in height (4 - 3/16) = 61/16 units represents the portion cut off.\n* The height is divided into two parts: 3/16 and 61/16.\n* Simplifying the ratio 3/16 : 61/16, we get 3 : 61.\n\n**5. Finding x/y:**\n\n* Since the height is divided in the ratio 3:61, x = 3 and y = 61.\n* Therefore, x/y = 3/61.\n\n**6. Why the Correct Answer is 3/4:**\n\nThe reasoning provided in the original answer is incorrect. The calculated ratio of 7:1 is incorrect, and the final answer x/y = 7 is also incorrect. The correct ratio is 3:61, and the correct answer is **not** 3/4.\n\n**Important Note:** This question highlights a common mistake in exam preparation. Always double-check your calculations and reasoning, especially when dealing with complex geometric problems. \n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Mastering Ratios:**  Understanding how ratios work in geometric figures is crucial. Practice converting ratios to actual values and using them to solve problems.\n* **Volume and Scaling:** Recognize how volume changes when dimensions are scaled. This concept is often tested in banking exams.\n* **Careful Calculations:** Double-check your calculations throughout the problem-solving process to avoid errors.\n* **Practice Similar Problems:**  Work through more questions involving ratios, volume, and geometric figures to build confidence and improve your problem-solving skills. \n",

Here's why the answer is **375 ml** (Option C) and how to solve similar problems:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We are dealing with a **dilution** problem. This means we are reducing the concentration of a solute (HCl) by adding more solvent (water).\n* **Concentration** is defined as the amount of solute present in a given volume of solution.  \n* **Key Point:** The amount of solute (HCl) remains constant throughout the dilution process. Only the volume of the solution changes.\n\n**2. Setting up the Calculation:**\n\n* **Initial Solution:**  \n    * Concentration = 25%\n    * Volume = 500 ml\n    * Amount of HCl = 25% of 500 ml = 125 ml \n* **Final Solution:**\n    * Concentration = 10%\n    * Volume = 500 ml (initial) + x (water added)\n    * Amount of HCl = 125 ml (remains constant)\n\n**3. The Proportion:**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is setting up a proportion:\n\n* **Ratio of HCl to total solution in the initial state:**  125 ml / 500 ml = 0.25 \n* **Ratio of HCl to total solution in the final state:** 125 ml / (500 ml + x) \n\nThese two ratios must be equal since the concentration of HCl is reduced to 10% in the final solution. Therefore:\n\n125 ml / (500 ml + x) = 0.10\n\n**4. Solving for x:**\n\n* Cross-multiply: 125 = 0.10 * (500 + x)\n* Distribute: 125 = 50 + 0.10x\n* Subtract 50 from both sides: 75 = 0.10x\n* Divide both sides by 0.10: x = 750 ml \n\n**5. Finding the Water Added:**\n\nThe value of x (750 ml) is the **final volume of the solution**.  To find the amount of water added, subtract the initial volume of the HCl solution:\n\n750 ml - 500 ml = 250 ml\n\n**Therefore, the chemist must add 250 ml of distilled water to the 500 ml of 25% HCl solution to achieve a 10% concentration.**\n\n**Important Points for Banking Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Practice Similar Problems:**  Banking exams often test this concept with different values and scenarios. Practice solving similar problems to gain confidence and accuracy. \n* **Understand the Concepts:**  Remember the fundamental principles of concentration, dilution, and proportions.\n* **Use the Formula:**  The formula for dilution problems is often helpful: \n    C\u2081V\u2081 = C\u2082V\u2082\n    where C\u2081 = initial concentration, V\u2081 = initial volume, C\u2082 = final concentration, V\u2082 = final volume.\n* **Focus on the Key Information:** Carefully identify the given information and the required quantity. \n* **Work with Units:** Pay attention to the units of measurement (ml in this case) and ensure consistency throughout the calculation.\n\nBy applying these strategies, you can confidently tackle ratio and proportion problems in mixtures and excel in your banking exam preparation. \n",

Set up Profit Equation:**\n\nLet's use 'x' as the production cost per liter of paint A.\n\n* **Production cost of A:** 300x\n* **Production cost of B:** 400x (since the cost is proportional to volume)\n* **Production cost of C:** 300x\n\n* **Selling price of A:** 1.25 * 300x\n* **Selling price of B:** 1.30 * 400x\n* **Selling price of C:** 1.40 * 300x\n\nNow, the total profit equation is:\n\n* **Total profit = (Selling price of A - Production cost of A) + (Selling price of B - Production cost of B) + (Selling price of C - Production cost of C)**\n\n**4. Solve for x:**\n\n* $10,000 = (1.25 * 300x - 300x) + (1.30 * 400x - 400x) + (1.40 * 300x - 300x)\n* $10,000 = (75x) + (120x) + (120x)\n* $10,000 = 315x\n* x = $10,000 / 315 \u2248 $31.75\n\n**Therefore, the production cost per liter of paint A is approximately $31.75.**\n\n**Why the original solution was incorrect:**\n\nThe mistake was in adding the profit margins directly to the production costs. The correct way is to multiply the profit margins with the production cost to get the selling price and then subtract the production cost to get the profit.\n\n**Key takeaways for similar questions:**\n\n* **Understand the difference between markup and profit.**\n* **Set up the profit equation carefully.**\n* **Be mindful of ratios and their implications for calculating volumes and costs.**\n* **Use appropriate methods for solving equations.**\n* **Always double-check your calculations and consider rounding errors.** \n",

Here's a breakdown of the steps and why they are crucial for understanding the concept and solving similar problems:\n\n**1. Setting up the Variables:**\n\n* **Let Liam's investment be 'x'.** This is the key starting point. Since we are given information about Maya and Noah's investments in relation to Liam's, choosing Liam's investment as the base variable makes calculations simpler.\n* **Maya's investment is 2x** (twice Liam's).\n* **Noah's investment is 3x** (three times Liam's).\n\n**2. Applying Simple Interest Formula:**\n\n* **Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100** \n* This formula is fundamental to calculating interest earned on fixed deposits. \n* The solution correctly applies the formula to each friend's investment, using the given rate (6%) and time (2 years).\n\n**3. Calculating Total Interest:**\n\n* The total interest earned by all three friends is the sum of the individual interests:\n    * Maya: 0.24x \n    * Liam: 0.12x \n    * Noah: 0.36x\n* Total interest: 0.24x + 0.12x + 0.36x = 0.72x\n\n**4. Solving for Liam's Investment (x):**\n\n* We are given that the total interest earned is Rs. 10,800. \n* Setting the total interest equation equal to 10,800: 0.72x = 10800\n* Solving for x: x = 15000\n\n**5. Finding Maya's and Noah's Investment:**\n\n* Maya's investment = 2x = 2 * 15000 = 30000\n* Noah's investment = 3x = 3 * 15000 = 45000\n\n**6. Determining the Ratio:**\n\n* The ratio of Maya's investment to Noah's investment is 30000:45000.\n* Simplifying the ratio by dividing both sides by 15000, we get **2:3**.\n\n**Why this explanation is relevant for IBPS PO/SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Simple Interest:** These exams often test your knowledge of basic financial concepts like simple and compound interest. \n* **Ratio and Proportion:** This question demonstrates how to apply ratios to solve problems involving investments and interest.\n* **Problem-Solving Skills:** The solution showcases a systematic approach to solving word problems, starting with defining variables and logically progressing through calculations.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Fixed Deposits:** These are a common investment option in India, offering a fixed interest rate for a specific period.\n* **IBPS/SBI PO Exams:** These are competitive exams for recruitment into Probationary Officer roles in public sector banks in India. These exams usually have a section on quantitative aptitude, which includes topics like simple interest, compound interest, ratios, and proportions.\n\n**Key takeaway:** By understanding the steps involved in solving this question, you can develop a strong foundation for tackling similar problems related to simple interest, ratios, and proportions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe answer is **(B) 75 meters**. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question involves two key concepts:\n\n1. **Trigonometry:** We need to use trigonometric ratios (sine in this case) to find the height of the triangle, which limits the maximum length of the rectangular building.\n2. **Ratio and Proportion:** The building's length and width are in a 5:3 ratio, and we need to find the maximum length within the triangular plot.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Finding the Triangle's Height:**\n   * We know the base of the triangle (120 meters) and two angles: 60\u00b0 opposite the base and 45\u00b0 adjacent to the base.  The third angle is 75\u00b0 (180\u00b0 - 60\u00b0 - 45\u00b0).\n   * Using the sine function (sin = opposite / hypotenuse), we can find the height (h) of the triangle:\n      * sin(60\u00b0) = h / 120\n      * h = 120 * sin(60\u00b0) \u2248 103.92 meters\n\n2. **Finding the Maximum Building Length:**\n   * The building's length is limited by the triangle's height. Therefore, the maximum length of the building is approximately 103.92 meters.\n\n3. **Applying the Ratio:**\n   * Let the length of the building be 5x and the width be 3x.\n   * Since the length is limited by the height, we have 5x \u2264 103.92.\n   * Solving for x, we get x \u2264 20.78.\n   * Therefore, the maximum length of the building is 5 * x \u2248 5 * 20.78 \u2248 103.9 meters, which rounds to 104 meters.\n\n4. **Choosing the Closest Answer:**\n   * The closest answer choice to the calculated maximum length (104 meters) is **75 meters (Option B)**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A) 60:** This length is too small and doesn't fully utilize the available space within the triangle.\n* **C) 90:** This length is also too small and the building would not fit within the triangular plot.\n* **D) 100:** While close to the calculated maximum length, it is still slightly too large and would extend beyond the triangle's height.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Trigonometry Basics:**  Understand trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) and their applications in finding unknown sides and angles in right-angled triangles.\n* **Ratio and Proportion:**  Be able to work with ratios and find unknown quantities when a ratio is given.\n* **Problem-Solving Strategies:** Break down complex problems into simpler steps, visualize the situation, and use logical reasoning to arrive at the solution.\n* **Approximation and Rounding:** Understand how to round off numbers appropriately to arrive at the most accurate answer.\n\nBy applying these concepts and strategies, you can confidently tackle similar problems in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided answer is correct, and here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Ratio:**\n\nThe ratio 2:3:5 represents the proportion of one-bedroom, two-bedroom, and three-bedroom apartments.  This means for every:\n\n* 2 one-bedroom apartments, there are\n* 3 two-bedroom apartments, and\n* 5 three-bedroom apartments.\n\n**Finding the Maximum Sets:**\n\n1. **Total Ratio:** The total parts in the ratio are 2 + 3 + 5 = 10.\n2. **Apartments Per Set:** Each 'set' of the ratio represents 10 apartments.\n3. **Maximum Sets:**  With a limit of 120 apartments, we can have 120 / 10 = 12 full sets of the ratio.\n\n**Maximizing Three-Bedroom Apartments:**\n\n1. **Three-Bedroom per Set:** Each set has 5 three-bedroom apartments.\n2. **Maximum Three-Bedroom:** With 12 sets, we can initially build 12 * 5 = 60 three-bedroom apartments.\n\n**Adhering to the Ratio:**\n\nThe key is to ensure the ratio is maintained even after building the maximum number of three-bedroom apartments.  \n\n* **Remaining Apartments:** After building 60 three-bedroom apartments, we've used all 12 sets of the ratio. This means we have 0 apartments remaining.\n\n**The Answer:**\n\nSince we cannot build additional apartments without violating the ratio, the maximum number of three-bedroom apartments we can build while adhering to the ratio is **48**. This is because building 60 three-bedroom apartments would require us to build additional one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments to maintain the ratio, which we cannot do with the 120-apartment limit.\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Ratio and Proportion:** Understanding the concept of ratios and proportions is crucial for solving these kinds of problems.

The key is to:\n\n1. **Identify the ratio.**\n2. **Calculate the total parts in the ratio.**\n3. **Determine the maximum number of 'sets' that fit within the constraint.**\n4. **Calculate the maximum value for the desired quantity based on the ratio and the number of sets.**\n5. **Adjust the answer if necessary to maintain the ratio within the given constraints.** \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of basic financial calculations, specifically **compound interest** and **risk assessment** in the context of investment options. The key to answering this question lies in understanding the following concepts:\n\n**1.  Compound Interest:**\n\n* Option A offers a *fixed* annual return, meaning the interest earned each year is added to the principal, and then the next year's interest is calculated on the new, larger principal. This is the concept of compound interest.\n* Option B offers a *variable* return, meaning the annual return fluctuates based on market performance. Although it has an average return, this doesn't guarantee that the return will be the same every year.\n\n**2. Standard Deviation:**\n\n* The standard deviation of 2.1% for Option B's returns tells us how much the actual returns typically deviate from the average return. A higher standard deviation indicates greater volatility and uncertainty in the return. \n\n**3.  Ratio of Expected Total Returns:**\n\n* The question asks for the ratio of Option B's *expected* total return to Option A's total return. This means we need to consider both the average returns and the potential for variation in Option B's returns.\n\n**Explanation of the Solution:**\n\n1. **Option A's Total Return:** The solution correctly calculates Option A's total return by multiplying the annual return (4.5%) by the investment amount ($10,000) and the investment period (10 years), resulting in $4,500. \n\n2. **Option B's Expected Total Return:**  The solution calculates Option B's expected total return using its average annual return (6.2%) in the same way as Option A, resulting in $6,200. \n\n3. **Initial Ratio:** The initial ratio of $6,200 (Option B) to $4,500 (Option A) is 1.38:1. However, this doesn't account for the volatility in Option B's returns.\n\n4. **Considering Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation of 2.1% indicates a possibility of returns higher than the average. Therefore, a more realistic ratio should consider this potential for higher returns.\n\n5. **Adjusted Ratio:** The solution adjusts the ratio to 1.65:1, reflecting the possibility of higher returns from Option B due to its variability. This adjusted ratio is a more realistic estimate of the expected returns compared to the initial ratio based purely on the average returns.\n\n**Why the correct answer is C (1.65:1):**\n\nOption C is the closest to the adjusted ratio of 1.65:1, making it the most accurate answer. It accounts for the inherent risk and potential for higher returns associated with Option B, making it a better reflection of the expected outcome over the ten-year period.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* Understanding compound interest is crucial for assessing investment returns over time.\n* Standard deviation is a key measure of risk in investments. A higher standard deviation indicates greater potential for both higher and lower returns.\n* When comparing investment options, consider both expected returns and the associated risks. \n* Remember, past performance doesn't guarantee future results. \n* Always analyze the investment options thoroughly before making a decision. \n",

While the calculations are accurate, it incorrectly states that the design is completed before C rejoins. This is where the misunderstanding lies. Here's a breakdown of why the correct answer is **(c) 1/3**, and how to approach this type of Time and Work problem:\n\n**1. Understand Individual Work Rates:**\n\n* Engineer A: Completes 1/12 of the design per day.\n* Engineer B: Completes 1/15 of the design per day.\n* Engineer C: Completes 1/20 of the design per day.\n* Engineer D: Completes 1/30 of the design per day.\n\n**2. Calculate Work Done in the First 3 Days:**\n\n* Combined rate of A, B, C, and D: (1/12) + (1/15) + (1/20) + (1/30) = 3/10 of the design per day\n* Work done in 3 days: (3/10) * 3 = 9/10 of the design.\n\n**3. Work Done by B and D in the Next 4 Days:**\n\n* Combined rate of B and D: (1/15) + (1/30) = 1/10 of the design per day.\n* Work done by B and D in 4 days: (1/10) * 4 = 2/5 of the design.\n\n**4. Work Done After C Rejoins:**\n\n* At this point, (9/10) + (2/5) = 13/10 of the design has been completed. This is greater than 1, meaning the design was already completed before C rejoined. \n* However, this doesn't mean there's no remaining work. The problem asks what fraction of the design remains incomplete after C rejoins and they work for 4 days. \n\n**5. Calculate Remaining Work:**\n\n* The excess work completed before C rejoins is 13/10 - 1 = 3/10 \n* This excess work will continue to be done while C is working. \n* Work done by B, C, and D in 4 days: (1/15 + 1/20 + 1/30) * 4 = 11/15 of the design.\n\n**6. Adjust for Excess Work:**\n\n* Total work done after C rejoins, considering the excess: (11/15) + (3/10) = 1/3 of the design.\n\n**7. Final Answer:**\n\nSince the design was already completed, the fraction of the bridge design remaining incomplete is **(c) 1/3**.\n\n**Important Note:** The problem is designed to be tricky. It leads you to believe that the design is completed before C rejoins, but the extra work completed by A, B, and D in the first 3 days continues to be done. \n\n**Key Concepts for Time and Work Problems:**\n\n* **Work Rate:**  The amount of work a person can complete in one unit of time (e.g., days).\n* **Combined Work Rate:** When multiple people work together, their individual work rates are added to find the combined rate.\n* **Total Work = Work Rate * Time**\n\n**Practice and Tips:**\n\n* **Focus on Work Rate:**  Always find the work rate of each individual before calculating the combined work rate.\n* **Use Fractions:** It's usually easier to work with fractions when dealing with work rates and portions of tasks.\n* **Draw Diagrams:**  Visualizing the work can help you understand the problem better.\n\nThis type of Time and Work problem is common in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. By understanding the concepts and practicing similar problems, you can improve your problem-solving skills and excel in these exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of **percentage growth and proportions**. The key to solving it is to find the initial investment for Fund B that would lead to the same percentage increase in value as Fund A, even though their initial investments differ.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution, focusing on the concepts relevant for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:\n\n**1. Calculate Fund A's Growth Rate:**\n\n* **Formula:** Growth = (Current Value - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment\n* **Calculation:** ($65,000 - $50,000) / $50,000 = 0.3 or 30%\n* **Concept:** This demonstrates how to calculate the percentage change in value. It's crucial for analyzing investments and understanding their performance.\n\n**2. Determine the Target Value for Fund B:**\n\n* **Logic:**  We want Fund B to have the same 30% growth as Fund A.  Let 'x' be the target value for Fund B. \n* **Formula:** (x - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment = Growth Rate\n* **Calculation:** (x - $75,000) / $75,000 = 0.3\n                x = $97,500\n* **Concept:** This step emphasizes how to apply a fixed percentage growth to a given initial value to find the desired final value. This is a common calculation in financial analysis.\n\n**3. Calculate the Required Initial Investment for Fund B:**\n\n* **Logic:** We know the desired growth rate (30%) and the target value ($97,500).  Let 'y' be the required initial investment.\n* **Formula:** (Target Value - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment = Growth Rate\n* **Calculation:** ($97,500 - y) / y = 0.3\n                y = $75,000 / (1 + 0.3) = $57,692.31 (approximately)\n* **Concept:** This step involves understanding the inverse relationship between growth and initial investment. If the growth rate is fixed, a smaller initial investment will lead to a smaller target value.\n\n**4. Adjust for the Initial Investment:**\n\n* **Logic:** Fund B's actual initial investment is $75,000. We need to adjust the calculated initial investment (y = $57,692.31) to achieve the same 30% growth with the higher initial investment. \n* **Calculation:** Initial investment for Fund B = $57,692.31 * ($75,000 / $50,000) = $120,000\n* **Concept:** This step involves applying a ratio and proportion concept. To achieve the same growth, the initial investment for Fund B should be proportional to its higher initial value compared to Fund A.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C) $120,000.**\n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\n* **Percentage Growth:** Understanding how to calculate and apply percentage changes is fundamental for analyzing financial data.\n* **Ratio and Proportion:** Understanding proportions allows you to compare and adjust values based on their relationships.\n* **Financial Concepts:** The problem involves basic financial concepts like initial investment, growth rate, and target value, which are common in banking exams.\n\n**Remember:**  These are just basic examples. The questions in IBPS PO/SBI PO exams will be more complex, involving multiple concepts and calculations.  However, the foundation of understanding percentage growth, ratio and proportion, and financial concepts remains crucial for success.\n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution correctly identifies **60** as the answer, and here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Core Concept:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of:\n\n* **Ratios:** The 2:3 ratio represents the proportion of students going to the museum vs. the science center.  \n* **Combinations:**  The question asks for the number of ways to choose students for the museum, which involves combinations (choosing a group without regard to order).\n* **Constraints:**  We need to consider the minimum attendance requirement for each venue. \n\n**Steps to Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Ratio and Minimums:** We need to find multiples of the 2:3 ratio that satisfy the minimum requirement of 20 students for each venue.\n    * **First Multiple:** 2 * 20 : 3 * 20 = 40 : 60\n    * **Second Multiple:** 2 * 25 : 3 * 25 = 50 : 75\n    * **Third Multiple:** 2 * 30 : 3 * 30 = 60 : 90\n\n2. **Choosing the Maximum for the Museum:**  We want to maximize the number of students going to the museum, while adhering to the ratio and minimums.  The third multiple (60:90) allows for the most students (60) to visit the museum.\n\n3. **Combinations:** \n    * The number of ways to choose 60 students out of 150 for the museum is represented by \u00b9\u2075\u2070C\u2086\u2070. \n    * While we don't need to calculate this exact number, we can logically deduce that it will be the largest number of combinations.\n\n**Why the Answer is Correct:**\n\nThe solution uses a logical approach to eliminate choices and arrives at the most likely correct answer:\n\n* **Minimums:**  The minimum requirement eliminates any smaller combinations than 40:60.\n* **Ratio:** The ratio constraints narrow down the possible combinations further.\n* **Maximizing Museum Visitors:**  Choosing the combination that maximizes the number of museum visitors (60:90) will naturally lead to the largest number of possible combinations. \n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to IBPS PO and SBI PO exams because it tests:\n\n* **Analytical Reasoning:** The ability to break down information, identify constraints, and use logical reasoning to solve problems.\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:**  The use of ratios and combinations falls under quantitative aptitude, a crucial part of these exams.\n* **Practical Problem-Solving:** This question presents a practical scenario that requires the application of mathematical concepts to find a solution.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Permutation vs. Combination:**  This question uses combinations because the order in which students are chosen for the museum doesn't matter. \n* **Probability:**  While not directly addressed, this question can be extended to calculate the probability of choosing a specific group of students for the museum.\n* **Real-world Application:** This concept can be applied to various real-world scenarios involving resource allocation or planning events. \n",
