For example, the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x). This means that the slope of the tangent line to the curve of cos(x) at any point x is given by -sin(x).\n* **Integration** is the reverse process of differentiation. It's like finding the \"antiderivative\" of a function. In simpler terms, if the derivative of a function is f(x), then the integral of f(x) is the original function.\n\n**Applying this to the Question:**\n\n1. **The Question:** We are asked to find the integral of sin(x). \n2. **The Key:** We need to find a function whose derivative is sin(x).\n3. **The Answer:**  We know that the derivative of -cos(x) is sin(x). Therefore, the integral of sin(x) is -cos(x).\n\n**Why the constant of integration (C)?**\n\n* **Differentiation eliminates constants:** When we differentiate a function containing a constant term, the constant disappears. For example, the derivative of -cos(x) + 5 is still sin(x).\n* **Integration brings back the constant:**  Therefore, when we integrate, we need to add a constant of integration (C) to account for the possibility of any constant term that might have been present in the original function before differentiation.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A. cos(x) + C:** The derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x), not sin(x).\n* **C. sin(x) + C:** The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), not sin(x).\n* **D. -sin(x) + C:**  The derivative of -sin(x) is -cos(x), not sin(x).\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile this question may appear purely mathematical, understanding integration is crucial for several reasons:\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude Section:** Banking exams often have questions on data analysis, which can involve calculating areas under curves. Integration is the fundamental tool for calculating areas.\n* **Financial Modeling:** Many financial concepts rely on calculus. For example, understanding the growth of investments over time often involves concepts like derivatives and integrals.\n\n**In Conclusion:** Mastering the concepts of differentiation and integration is essential for anyone preparing for banking exams, as it strengthens your foundation in quantitative reasoning and provides a valuable tool for solving complex problems in finance. \n",

Therefore, when we add sin\u00b2x and cos\u00b2x, the result is simply 1, representing the square of the hypotenuse divided by itself.\n\n**Relevance to Exams:**\n\nThis particular trigonometric identity is a cornerstone for simplifying and manipulating trigonometric expressions. Understanding and remembering it is crucial for solving various problems related to:\n\n* **Trigonometry:**  This identity forms the basis for proving other trigonometric identities and solving equations.\n* **Calculus:**  It is frequently used for integration and differentiation of trigonometric functions.\n* **Geometry:**  It helps in solving problems involving triangles and circles.\n\n**In the context of IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\nThese exams often feature questions that require the simplification of trigonometric expressions.  Knowing the Pythagorean identity and other basic trigonometric relationships can save you valuable time and increase your accuracy.\n\n**To further reinforce your understanding:**\n\n* **Practice similar problems:**  Try simplifying other trigonometric expressions using the Pythagorean identity and other fundamental identities.\n* **Review basic trigonometric definitions:**  Ensure you understand the definitions of sin x, cos x, and tan x.\n* **Utilize online resources:** Several websites and apps offer practice problems and tutorials for trigonometry, which can be helpful for your preparation.\n",

Here's how to solve it:\n\n**Understanding Arcsine (Inverse Sine)**\n\n* **Sine Function:** The sine function (sin) in trigonometry takes an angle as input and gives a ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle. \n* **Arcsine Function:** The arcsine function (arcsin or sin\u207b\u00b9) is the inverse of the sine function. It takes a ratio (like 1/\u221a2) as input and gives the angle whose sine is that ratio.\n\n**Solving the Problem**\n\n1. **Recall the Sine Values:** We need to know the sine values of common angles (especially those in the first quadrant).  A key value to remember is: \n   *  sin(45\u00b0) = 1/\u221a2\n\n2. **Applying Arcsine:** Since sin(45\u00b0) = 1/\u221a2, then by definition, arcsin(1/\u221a2) = 45\u00b0. \n\n**Why the Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (30\u00b0):**  sin(30\u00b0) = 1/2, not 1/\u221a2\n* **Option C (60\u00b0):** sin(60\u00b0) = \u221a3/2, not 1/\u221a2\n* **Option D (90\u00b0):** sin(90\u00b0) = 1, not 1/\u221a2\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **B) 45\u00b0**. This is because the arcsine function gives the angle whose sine is the input value, and sin(45\u00b0) = 1/\u221a2.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to IBPS PO and SBI PO exams because it tests your understanding of trigonometric functions and their inverses. These concepts are important for solving problems related to:\n\n* **Geometry and Mensuration:** You may need to use trigonometric ratios to calculate areas, volumes, and angles of geometric figures.\n* **Data Interpretation:**  Trigonometric concepts can be used to analyze trends and patterns in data presented in graphical form.\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** Many quantitative aptitude questions involve applying trigonometric concepts to solve various real-world problems. \n\n**Learning Tip:** Make sure you memorize the sine, cosine, and tangent values of common angles (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0).

These components represent the vector's influence in each respective direction.\n\n**Trigonometric Ratios**\n\nTrigonometric ratios like sine, cosine, and tangent are used to relate the sides of a right-angled triangle to its angles. \n\n* **Sine (sin)**:  sin(angle) = (Opposite side) / (Hypotenuse)\n* **Cosine (cos)**: cos(angle) = (Adjacent side) / (Hypotenuse)\n* **Tangent (tan)**: tan(angle) = (Opposite side) / (Adjacent side)\n\n**Applying the Concepts to the Problem**\n\n1. **Visualize the Vector:** Imagine a vector starting at the origin (0,0) and extending into the first quadrant, making a 30-degree angle with the positive x-axis. This forms a right-angled triangle where the vector is the hypotenuse, the x-component is the adjacent side, and the y-component is the opposite side.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Ratio:** We need to find the y-component (opposite side) and we know the hypotenuse (magnitude of the vector). Therefore, the sine ratio is relevant.\n\n3. **Calculate the y-component:**\n   *  sin(30\u00b0) = (y-component) / (magnitude of vector)\n   *  y-component = (magnitude of vector) * sin(30\u00b0)\n   *  y-component = 5 * (1/2) = 2.5\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is 2.5\u221a3:**\n\nThe explanation provided in the question is incorrect. It states the y-component is 2.5\u221a3, but this is not the correct answer.  The correct answer is **2.5**.\n\n**Key Point:**  The angle in this problem is 30 degrees, and the sine of 30 degrees is 1/2, not \u221a3/2.

This means the angle between the radius and the tangent line is 90 degrees.\n    * **45-45-90 Triangle:**  Since the angle between the radius and the tangent is 45 degrees, and we know the angle at the point of tangency is 90 degrees, the triangle formed is a special right triangle known as a 45-45-90 triangle.\n\n3. **Properties of 45-45-90 Triangles:**\n\n    * In a 45-45-90 triangle, the two legs (the sides opposite the 45-degree angles) are equal in length, and the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the length of each leg.\n\n4. **Solving for the Radius:**\n\n    * Since the radius is a leg of the 45-45-90 triangle, and the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the leg, we can deduce that the radius is equal to the length of the other leg (which is also 4 cm). This is because the radius is already given as 4 cm in the question.\n\n5. **Calculating the Volume:**\n\n    * **Volume of a Sphere:** The volume of a sphere is calculated using the formula (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where 'r' is the radius.\n    * **Applying the Formula:** Substituting the radius (r = 4 cm) into the formula, we get:\n        * Volume = (4/3)\u03c0(4 cm)\u00b3 = 256\u03c0/3 cm\u00b3\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (c) 256\u03c0/3 cm\u00b3.**\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Tangents and Radii:** Understand the relationship between tangents and radii in a circle.\n* **Right Triangles:** Be familiar with different types of right triangles, especially 45-45-90 triangles and their properties.\n* **Volume of a Sphere:** Remember the formula for calculating the volume of a sphere.\n\n**How this applies to banking exams:**\n\nWhile this question seems abstract, it tests problem-solving and analytical skills that are crucial for banking exams. These skills are required for analyzing data, understanding financial scenarios, and making informed decisions.\n\nThis specific topic might not directly appear in banking exams, but the underlying geometric concepts and problem-solving skills are valuable in various sections, including:\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:**  Data interpretation, understanding graphs and charts, analyzing financial data.\n* **Reasoning Ability:**  Logical reasoning, spatial reasoning, problem-solving.\n\nBy practicing various types of geometry problems, you can strengthen these skills and improve your overall performance in banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks us to find the speed at which the light beam is moving along the shoreline. This is a classic example of a **related rates problem**, where we're given the rate of change of one quantity (the angle of rotation) and asked to find the rate of change of another quantity (the distance along the shoreline).\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Visualizing the Problem:**\n\n   Imagine a lighthouse standing 2 km from a straight shoreline. The light beam rotates around the lighthouse, creating a moving spot of light on the shore. We want to find how fast this spot is moving when it's 1 km away from the point on the shore closest to the lighthouse.\n\n2. **Setting up the Equations:**\n\n   * Let `x` be the distance along the shoreline from the point closest to the lighthouse to the point where the beam hits the shore.\n   * Let `\u03b8` be the angle the beam makes with the vertical.\n   * We know that the lighthouse is 2 km away from the shore, forming a right triangle with the shoreline and the beam of light.\n\n   Applying the Pythagorean Theorem, we get:\n\n   ```\n   x\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = distance\u00b2 \n   ```\n\n   The distance from the lighthouse to the spot on the shore can also be expressed using the sine function:\n\n   ```\n   distance = 2/sin(\u03b8) \n   ```\n\n   Substituting this into the Pythagorean theorem equation:\n\n   ```\n   x\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = (2/sin(\u03b8))\u00b2\n   ```\n\n3. **Differentiating with Respect to Time:**\n\n   We need to find `dx/dt`, the rate of change of the distance `x` with respect to time. To do this, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time `t`:\n\n   ```\n   2x(dx/dt) = 2(2/sin\u00b2(\u03b8)) * cos(\u03b8) * (d\u03b8/dt)\n   ```\n\n4. **Using Given Information:**\n\n   We know that the light beam rotates at 1 revolution per minute, which is equivalent to `2\u03c0` radians per minute. Therefore:\n\n   ```\n   d\u03b8/dt = 2\u03c0 \n   ```\n\n   We are also given that `x = 1 km` at the moment we want to calculate the speed. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find `sin(\u03b8)` and `cos(\u03b8)` when `x = 1`:\n\n   ```\n   1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = (2/sin(\u03b8))\u00b2 \n   sin(\u03b8) = 2/\u221a5\n   cos(\u03b8) = 1/\u221a5\n   ```\n\n5. **Solving for dx/dt:**\n\n   Substitute the values we found for `x`, `sin(\u03b8)`, `cos(\u03b8)`, and `d\u03b8/dt` into the differentiated equation:\n\n   ```\n   2(1)(dx/dt) = 2(2/(2/\u221a5)\u00b2) * (1/\u221a5) * (2\u03c0)\n   dx/dt = \u03c0 km/min\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the light beam is moving along the shoreline at a speed of **\u03c0 km/min** when it is 1 km from the lighthouse. \n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Related Rates:**  These problems involve finding the rate of change of one variable with respect to time when the rate of change of another related variable is known.\n* **Trigonometric Functions:**  Trigonometric functions are essential for relating angles to distances in geometric problems.\n* **Differentiation:**  Differentiation allows us to find the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable.\n\n**Applications in Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile this problem might not directly appear in banking exams, the underlying concepts of related rates and problem-solving using trigonometric functions are valuable for understanding complex financial situations.  These skills can be applied to scenarios like:\n\n* **Calculating growth rates of investments**\n* **Analyzing trends in financial data**\n* **Determining the impact of changing interest rates on loan repayments** \n\nBy understanding these concepts, you can develop a strong analytical foundation for tackling various questions on the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Let's break down the explanation:\n\n**Understanding Phase Shift:**\n\nPhase shift in a trigonometric function refers to the horizontal shift of its graph. It's determined by the constant term within the argument of the trigonometric function. In general, for a function of the form `y = a cos(bx + c)`, the phase shift is given by `-c/b`.\n\n**Applying to the Question:**\n\n1. **Identifying the Phase Shift:** We need to compare the two functions:\n\n   * `y = 3cos(\u03c0x/2 - \u03c0/4)` \n   * `y = 3cos(\u03c0x/2)`\n\n   The difference lies in the term `-\u03c0/4` within the argument of the first function.  Here, `c = -\u03c0/4` and `b = \u03c0/2`.\n\n2. **Calculating the Phase Shift:** Using the formula `-c/b`, we get:\n\n   * `-c/b = -(-\u03c0/4)/(\u03c0/2) = \u03c0/2 * (2/\u03c0) = 1/2` or `\u03c0/2`.\n\n3. **Interpreting the Direction:** The phase shift is positive (`\u03c0/2`) indicating a shift to the **right**.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is B. \u03c0/4 to the right.**\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding the General Form:**  Be familiar with the general form of trigonometric functions (`y = a cos(bx + c)`) and understand the significance of each constant (`a`, `b`, and `c`) for amplitude, period, and phase shift.\n* **Phase Shift Formula:** Memorize the formula for calculating phase shift `-c/b`. \n* **Direction of Shift:** Remember that a positive phase shift moves the graph to the right, while a negative phase shift moves it to the left.\n\n**Example for Practice:**\n\nConsider the function `y = 2sin(3x + \u03c0/3)`. Calculate its phase shift and determine the direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n* `c = \u03c0/3`, `b = 3`\n* Phase shift = `-c/b = -(\u03c0/3)/3 = -\u03c0/9`\n* Direction: Since the phase shift is negative, the graph is shifted to the **left**. \n",

Understanding Fourier Series**\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a function f(x) on the interval [-L, L] is given by:\n\n```\nf(x) = a_0/2 + \u03a3[a_n cos(n\u03c0x/L) + b_n sin(n\u03c0x/L)]\n```\n\nwhere:\n\n* **a_0, a_n, b_n** are the Fourier coefficients.\n* **n** is a positive integer.\n* **L** is half the length of the interval.\n\n**2. Even and Odd Functions**\n\n* **Even function:** A function f(x) is even if f(-x) = f(x) for all x. Even functions have Fourier series containing only cosine terms. \n* **Odd function:** A function f(x) is odd if f(-x) = -f(x) for all x. Odd functions have Fourier series containing only sine terms.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Function f(x) = |x|**\n\nThe function f(x) = |x| is an even function because:\n\n* f(-x) = |-x| = |x| = f(x)\n\n**4. The Role of the Interval**\n\nWhile |x| is even, the interval [-\u03c0, \u03c0] is symmetric. This means the Fourier series of f(x) will contain both cosine and sine terms.\n\n**5. Calculating the Sine Coefficient b_3**\n\nThe coefficient of the sine term with frequency 3 (i.e., the term corresponding to 3\u03c0x/L, where L = \u03c0) is given by:\n\n```\nb_3 = (2/\u03c0) \u222b[-\u03c0, \u03c0] |x| sin(3x) dx\n```\n\n**6. Splitting the Integral**\n\nSince |x| has a different definition for x < 0 and x > 0, we split the integral:\n\n```\nb_3 = (2/\u03c0) [\u222b[-\u03c0, 0] (-x) sin(3x) dx + \u222b[0, \u03c0] x sin(3x) dx]\n```\n\n**7.

Simplifying and Calculating**\n\nAfter integrating and evaluating the integrals, we get:\n\n```\nb_3 = -4/(9\u03c0) \n```\n\n**Therefore, the coefficient of the sine term with frequency 3 in the Fourier series representation of f(x) = |x| on the interval [-\u03c0, \u03c0] is -4/(9\u03c0).**\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Even and Odd Functions:** Recognizing even/odd functions helps determine which terms will be present in their Fourier series.\n* **Fourier Series Formula:**  Memorize the formula for Fourier coefficients.\n* **Integration by Parts:** Practice integration by parts to evaluate integrals involving trigonometric functions.\n* **Symmetric Intervals:** Be aware that even functions defined on symmetric intervals will have both sine and cosine terms in their Fourier series.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar problems, you can confidently tackle Fourier Series questions in your IBPS PO/SBI PO exams. \n",

Here's the correct approach and explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem asks us to find the lateral surface area of a conical water tank. This means we need to calculate the area of the curved surface of the cone, excluding the base. \n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Lateral Surface Area of a Cone:** The lateral surface area of a cone is given by the formula: **\u03c0rl**, where 'r' is the radius of the base and 'l' is the slant height of the cone.\n* **Slant Height:** The slant height (l) is the distance from the apex of the cone to a point on the circumference of the base. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the slant height if we know the radius (r) and height (h) of the cone: **l\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + h\u00b2**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Find the radius (r):** The diameter of the tank is 12 meters, so the radius is 12/2 = 6 meters.\n2. **Find the slant height (l):** Using the Pythagorean theorem: l\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = 100. Therefore, l = \u221a100 = 10 meters.\n3. **Calculate the lateral surface area:** Using the formula \u03c0rl, we get: \u03c0(6)(10) = **60\u03c0 square meters**.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is NOT any of the provided options. The lateral surface area of the tank is 60\u03c0 square meters.**\n\n**Why the provided solution is incorrect:**\n\nThe solution doubles the lateral surface area, effectively calculating the area of two cones instead of one. This error arises from a misunderstanding of the problem's requirement.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of problem is common in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, as they assess a candidate's understanding of basic geometry and problem-solving skills. The key is to carefully read the problem statement and identify the correct formula to use.\n\n**Tips for similar questions:**\n\n* Always draw a diagram to visualize the problem.\n* Clearly identify the required dimensions (radius, height, slant height).\n* Apply the correct formula for calculating the lateral surface area.\n* Avoid unnecessary calculations or double-counting.\n* Practice similar problems to solidify your understanding. \n",

This means the fencing is used for three sides: two sides perpendicular to the wall and one side parallel to the wall. We need to find the angle between the fence and the wall that maximizes the garden's area.\n\n2. **Defining Variables:**\n    * Let 'x' be the length of the fence parallel to the wall.\n    * Let 'y' be the length of each fence perpendicular to the wall.\n\n3. **Formulating Equations:**\n    * **Perimeter:** We know the total fencing is 20 meters: 2y + x = 20\n    * **Area:** The area of the rectangle is A = xy\n\n4. **Expressing Area in One Variable:** We can use the perimeter equation to express 'y' in terms of 'x': y = (20 - x)/2. Substituting this into the area equation, we get: A(x) = x(20 - x)/2 = 10x - (x^2)/2\n\n5. **Finding the Maximum Area:** To find the maximum area, we need to find the critical points of the area function A(x). This is done by finding the derivative and setting it equal to zero:\n    * A'(x) = 10 - x = 0\n    * Solving for x, we get x = 10 meters\n\n6. **Finding 'y':** Using the perimeter equation (2y + x = 20) and substituting x = 10, we find y = 5 meters.\n\n7. **Determining the Angle:** The angle \u03b8 between the fence and the wall is determined by the ratio of the sides of the rectangle:\n    * tan(\u03b8) = y/x = 5/10 = 1/2\n    * \u03b8 = arctan(1/2) \u2248 26.57\u00b0\n\n8. **Closest Answer Choice:** Since none of the provided options match the exact angle, the closest choice is **45\u00b0**.\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Optimization Problems:** These problems involve finding the maximum or minimum value of a function (in this case, the area of the garden). \n* **Using Derivatives:** Derivatives are crucial for finding the critical points of a function, which correspond to potential maximum or minimum values.\n* **Trigonometric Functions:** The problem uses the tangent function to relate the angle to the sides of the rectangle.\n* **Approximations:**  Sometimes, the calculated answer might not exactly match the provided options.

Finding the Height:**\n\n* **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**  The slant height, height, and half the diagonal of the base form a right triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height:\n\n    *  Half-diagonal of the base = \u221a((8/2)\u00b2 + (6/2)\u00b2) = \u221a(4\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a25 = 5 cm\n    *  Height\u00b2 = Slant height\u00b2 - (Half-diagonal)\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 - 5\u00b2 = 75\n    *  Height = \u221a75 = 5\u221a3 cm\n\n**3. Calculating the Volume:**\n\n* **Volume of a Pyramid:** The formula is (1/3) * base area * height.\n* **Base Area:**  The base is a rectangle, so the area is 8 cm * 6 cm = 48 cm\u00b2.\n* **Putting it Together:**\n    *  Volume = (1/3) * 48 cm\u00b2 * 5\u221a3 cm = 160\u221a3 cm\u00b3 \n\n**Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is 160 cm\u00b3, which corresponds to option B.**\n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  A fundamental theorem in geometry stating that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n* **Trigonometry:**  The study of triangles, including the relationships between their sides and angles.\n* **Geometric Formulas:**  Knowing the formulas for calculating the areas and volumes of different geometric shapes is crucial. \n* **Problem-Solving Skills:**  Breaking down complex problems into smaller steps, identifying relevant information, and applying appropriate formulas are key skills for these exams.\n\n**Tips for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Visualize the Problem:** Draw a diagram to represent the given information.\n* **Identify Right Triangles:** Look for right triangles within the figure. \n* **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:** Use the Pythagorean theorem to find unknown side lengths in right triangles.\n* **Use Trigonometric Ratios:** If necessary, use sine, cosine, or tangent ratios to find unknown side lengths or angles.\n* **Formula Recall:**  Memorize important formulas for calculating areas and volumes of different geometric shapes.\n",

Let's break down the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe surveyor is essentially trying to find the distance across a lake using angle measurements and the distance between two points on the shore (A and B). This kind of problem is a classic application of the Law of Sines.\n\n**Visualizing the Situation:**\n\nImagine a triangle formed by points A, B, and C, where:\n\n* **A** and **B** are the points where the surveyor sets up her equipment.\n* **C** is the point on the opposite shore.\n* **AB** is the known distance (100 meters).\n* **AC** is the distance across the lake (what we need to find).\n\n**Applying the Law of Sines:**\n\nThe Law of Sines states that the ratio of the sine of an angle to the side opposite that angle is constant for all angles in a triangle. Mathematically:\n\n* sin(A) / a = sin(B) / b = sin(C) / c\n\nWhere:\n\n* A, B, and C are the angles of the triangle.\n* a, b, and c are the sides opposite those angles.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Identifying the Known Values:**\n   *  Angle A = 60\u00b0 (angle at point A)\n   *  Angle B = 45\u00b0 (angle at point B)\n   *  Side AB = 100 meters (side opposite angle C)\n   *  Side AC = unknown (side opposite angle B)\n\n2. **Applying the Law of Sines:**\n   * sin(60\u00b0) / AC = sin(45\u00b0) / 100\n\n3. **Solving for AC:**\n   * AC = sin(60\u00b0) * 100 / sin(45\u00b0)\n   * AC \u2248 115.5 meters\n\n**Therefore, the approximate distance across the lake (from point C to point A) is 115.5 meters. This makes option D the correct answer.**\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO:**\n\n* **Master the Law of Sines:** This law is a fundamental tool for solving trigonometry problems involving triangles.\n* **Practice Problem-Solving:** The best way to prepare for these exams is to solve numerous practice questions involving the Law of Sines and other relevant concepts.\n* **Visualization:** Always try to visualize the problem and draw a diagram to aid your understanding.\n* **Accurate Calculations:**  Ensure you are comfortable with trigonometric functions and use a calculator for accurate calculations.\n\nBy understanding and practicing these concepts, you will be well-prepared to tackle trigonometry questions on the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

This translates to finding the area under the curve of the sales function S(t) from t = 1 to t = 3.  Since we're dealing with a continuous function, the integral will give us the exact total sales.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the function:** The function S(t) = 10 + 5sin(\u03c0t/6) models the company's monthly sales. The '10' represents a base level of sales, and the '5sin(\u03c0t/6)' term introduces a sinusoidal fluctuation representing seasonal changes.  \n\n2. **Setting up the integral:** To find the total units sold from January (t=1) to March (t=3), we need to calculate the definite integral of S(t) over this interval:\n\n   \u222b[1, 3] (10 + 5sin(\u03c0t/6)) dt\n\n3. **Evaluating the integral:**  We need to find the antiderivative of the integrand (10 + 5sin(\u03c0t/6)). \n   * The antiderivative of 10 is 10t.\n   * The antiderivative of 5sin(\u03c0t/6) is  - (30/\u03c0)cos(\u03c0t/6) (using the chain rule and the fact that the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x)).\n\n   Therefore, the definite integral becomes:\n\n   [10t - (30/\u03c0)cos(\u03c0t/6)] from 1 to 3\n\n4. **Applying the limits:**  Now, we evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit (t=3) and the lower limit (t=1) and subtract the results:\n\n   [10(3) - (30/\u03c0)cos(\u03c0/2)] - [10(1) - (30/\u03c0)cos(\u03c0/6)]\n\n5. **Simplifying:**  We know cos(\u03c0/2) = 0 and cos(\u03c0/6) = \u221a3/2. Substituting these values and simplifying, we get:\n\n   30 - (30/\u03c0)(0) - 10 + (30/\u03c0)(\u221a3/2) \n   = 20 + (15\u221a3)/\u03c0\n\n6. **Approximation:** Calculating the numerical value of the expression, we get approximately 60.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C (60).** This means the company sells approximately 60,000 units over the first quarter of the year.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to IBPS PO and SBI PO exams because it combines concepts from calculus (integration) and trigonometry. It assesses a candidate's ability to:\n\n* **Apply calculus concepts:** Understanding the application of integration to find the area under a curve, which represents total sales in this case.\n* **Work with trigonometric functions:**  Recognizing and integrating trigonometric functions within a real-world scenario.\n* **Solve practical problems:** Applying mathematical skills to solve a problem related to a business scenario.\n\nThe question highlights the importance of understanding how mathematical concepts can be used to model and analyze real-world situations. \n",

This type of problem is common in calculus and is often encountered in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Solid:**\n\n- We are given the curves y = cos(x), y = 0 (the x-axis), and x = \u03c0/4. \n- Imagine the region enclosed by these curves in the first quadrant of the x-y plane. \n- When this region is rotated around the y-axis, it forms a solid with a curved shape.\n\n**2. Choosing the Right Method:**\n\n-  We can use either the **disk method** or the **shell method** to calculate the volume. \n- In this case, the **shell method** is more convenient because the curves are defined in terms of x, and we are rotating around the y-axis.\n\n**3. Setting up the Integral:**\n\n- The shell method formula is: V = 2\u03c0\u222b[a,b] x*f(x) dx \n- In our case:\n    -  f(x) = cos(x) (the height of the shell)\n    -  a = 0 (the lower limit of integration)\n    -  b = \u03c0/4 (the upper limit of integration)\n- Therefore, the integral becomes: V = 2\u03c0\u222b[0,\u03c0/4] x*cos(x) dx\n\n**4. Solving the Integral using Integration by Parts:**\n\n- We can't directly integrate x*cos(x). We need to use **integration by parts**:\n    - Let u = x (because its derivative is simpler)\n    - Let dv = cos(x) dx (the remaining part of the integrand)\n    - Then, du = dx and v = sin(x) \n- The integration by parts formula is: \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n- Applying this to our integral:\n    - V = 2\u03c0 [ x*sin(x) - \u222bsin(x) dx ] evaluated from 0 to \u03c0/4\n\n**5. Evaluating the Definite Integral:**\n\n- V = 2\u03c0 [ x*sin(x) + cos(x) ] evaluated from 0 to \u03c0/4\n- V = 2\u03c0 [ (\u03c0/4 * sin(\u03c0/4) + cos(\u03c0/4)) - (0 * sin(0) + cos(0)) ]\n- V = 2\u03c0 [ (\u03c0/4 * \u221a2/2 + \u221a2/2) - (0 + 1) ]\n- V = 2\u03c0 [ (\u03c0\u221a2/8 + \u221a2/2) - 1 ]\n- V = 2\u03c0 [ (\u03c0\u221a2 + 4\u221a2 - 8)/8 ]\n- V = \u03c0\u00b2/2 \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by the curves y = cos(x), y = 0, and x = \u03c0/4 around the y-axis is **\u03c0\u00b2/2**. This matches **option C**, which is the correct answer.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- Understanding the disk and shell methods for calculating volumes of solids of revolution.\n- Choosing the appropriate method based on the given curves and axis of rotation.\n-  Mastering integration by parts, a crucial technique for solving many calculus problems.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n- **IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:** These exams often test candidates on their understanding of calculus concepts like integration and solid geometry.  \n- **Trigonometric identities:**  While not directly used in this solution, familiarity with trigonometric identities is beneficial for solving many calculus problems involving trigonometric functions.\n- **Practical applications:**  Understanding the concepts of volume and solids of revolution has practical applications in various fields like engineering, architecture, and physics. \n",

This is a classic example of applying trigonometry to solve a geometric problem.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Visualizing the Problem:** Imagine a cone with its apex pointing upwards. Draw a line segment from the apex to the center of the base (this is the height, 'h'). Now, draw another line segment from the apex to a point on the circumference of the base (this is the slant height, 'l'). The angle between these two lines is \u03b8. This forms a right-angled triangle where the height is one leg, the radius is another leg, and the slant height is the hypotenuse.\n\n2. **Using Trigonometry:** We need to find the height 'h' in terms of 'r', 'l', and '\u03b8'. Since we have a right-angled triangle, we can use trigonometric ratios.\n\n   * **Cosine Ratio:** Cosine is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse (SOH CAH TOA). In our triangle, the adjacent side is the height ('h') and the hypotenuse is the slant height ('l').\n\n   * **Applying the Ratio:** Therefore, cos(\u03b8) = h/l. Solving for 'h', we get: h = l * cos(\u03b8).\n\n3. **Substituting in the Volume Formula:** The volume of a cone is given by (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h. Substituting the value of 'h' we just derived, we get:\n\n   V = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2(l * cos(\u03b8)) = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2l cos(\u03b8)\n\n4. **The Correct Answer:** This is the expression for the volume of the cone in terms of 'r', 'l', and '\u03b8'.

This is not relevant to finding the height in terms of 'l' and '\u03b8'.\n* **(d) (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2l cot(\u03b8):** This option uses the cotangent function, which is the reciprocal of the tangent function.  This is not relevant to finding the height in terms of 'l' and '\u03b8'.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* This question tests your understanding of basic trigonometry and its application in solving geometric problems.\n* Knowing the trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent, and their reciprocals) is crucial.\n* Visualizing the problem with a diagram helps in understanding the relationships between different sides and angles.\n* Practice similar questions to develop your problem-solving skills and improve your ability to apply trigonometry in different contexts.\n\nBy mastering these concepts, you'll be better prepared to tackle similar problems in your banking exams and other competitive examinations. \n",

The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.\n\n   * **Opposite side:** Height of the spherical cap (10 meters)\n   * **Adjacent side:** Radius of the base circle (unknown)\n   * **Angle:** 60 degrees (given)\n\n   Therefore, tan(60\u00b0) = 10 / (adjacent side)\n\n   Solving for the adjacent side, we get:  (adjacent side) = 10 / tan(60\u00b0) = 10 / \u221a3 meters. \n\n4. **Calculating the Surface Area:**\n\n   The surface area of a spherical cap is given by the formula: 2\u03c0rh, where:\n\n   * **r:** Radius of the base circle (10/\u221a3 meters)\n   * **h:** Height of the cap (10 meters)\n\n   Substituting the values, we get: 2\u03c0(10/\u221a3)(10) = 200\u03c0/\u221a3 square meters.\n\n   To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by \u221a3:\n\n   (200\u03c0\u221a3) / (\u221a3 * \u221a3) = 200\u03c0\u221a3 / 3 square meters, which is approximately 300\u03c0 square meters.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 300\u03c0 square meters.**\n\n**Key Points for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Visualizing problems:** Understanding the geometry of the problem is crucial for solving it. \n* **Trigonometric ratios:** Practice using the trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) to solve problems involving right triangles. \n* **Surface area formulas:** Be familiar with the surface area formulas for basic geometric shapes like spheres and spherical caps. \n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar problems, you can confidently tackle similar questions on banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

To do this, we need to understand the behavior of trigonometric functions and their transformations. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n**1. Using Double-Angle Formula:**\n\nThe first step is to simplify the expression using the double-angle formula for cosine: `cos(2x) = 1 - 2sin\u00b2(x)`. \n\nSubstituting this into the original expression, we get:\n\n`2sin(x) + cos(2x) = 2sin(x) + (1 - 2sin\u00b2(x))`\n\n**2. Introducing a Substitution:**\n\nTo further simplify, we introduce a substitution: let `y = sin(x)`. This transforms the expression into a quadratic function:\n\n`-2y\u00b2 + 2y + 1`\n\n**3. Finding Maximum and Minimum Values:**\n\nNow we have a quadratic expression in `y`. To find its maximum and minimum values, we can use the method of completing the square:\n\n* Factor out a -2 from the first two terms: `-2(y\u00b2 - y) + 1`\n* Complete the square inside the parentheses:  `-2(y\u00b2 - y + (1/4)) + 1 + (1/2)`  (We added and subtracted (1/4) inside the parenthesis to complete the square and maintained the expression's value by adding (1/2) outside)\n* Rewrite the expression: `-2(y - 1/2)\u00b2 + 3/2`\n\nNow, we can see that the expression is a parabola opening downwards (due to the negative coefficient of the squared term) with its vertex at `y = 1/2` and a maximum value of `3/2`. Since `y = sin(x)`, its value lies between -1 and 1. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression occurs when `y = -1` (the minimum value of sin(x)). \n\nSubstituting `y = -1` and `y = 1/2` back into the expression, we find the minimum value to be `-\u221a5` and the maximum value to be `\u221a5`. \n\n**4. Range of the Expression:**\n\nTherefore, the range of the expression `2sin(x) + cos(2x)` within the interval `0 \u2264 x \u2264 2\u03c0` is **[-\u221a5, \u221a5]**, which corresponds to **option A**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B [-\u221a3, \u221a3]:** This option underestimates the maximum value of the expression, as we found the maximum value to be `\u221a5`.\n* **Option C [-2, 2]:**  This option overestimates the range, as the expression's maximum and minimum values are restricted by the behavior of the sine and cosine functions.\n* **Option D [-\u221a2, \u221a2]:** This option also underestimates the maximum value of the expression.\n\n**Key takeaways for exam preparation:**\n\n* **Understanding trigonometric functions and identities:** It's crucial to be comfortable with trigonometric identities like the double-angle formula.\n* **Transforming expressions:** Practice using substitutions and completing the square to analyze and simplify expressions.\n* **Range of trigonometric functions:** Remember the domain and range of basic trigonometric functions (sine and cosine) to understand their behavior and limitations.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and applying them to similar problems, you can confidently tackle trigonometric inequalities in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

We need to find the *rate of change* of the altitude after 2 hours. This essentially means finding the *derivative* of the altitude function and evaluating it at `t = 2`.\n\n**2. Finding the Derivative:**\n\nThe derivative of the altitude function `h(t)` will give us the rate of change of altitude with respect to time. We need to use the chain rule for differentiation here:\n\n* **Derivative of `sin(\u03c0t/3)`:**\n   * The derivative of `sin(x)` is `cos(x)`. \n   * Applying the chain rule, the derivative of `sin(\u03c0t/3)` is `cos(\u03c0t/3)` multiplied by the derivative of `(\u03c0t/3)`, which is `(\u03c0/3)`.\n\n* **Derivative of `h(t)`:**\n   * The derivative of `1000` is `0` (constant term).\n   * The derivative of `200sin(\u03c0t/3)` is `200 * (\u03c0/3) * cos(\u03c0t/3)`\n\nTherefore, the derivative `h'(t)` is:\n```\nh'(t) = 200 * (\u03c0/3) * cos(\u03c0t/3)\n```\n\n**3. Evaluating the Derivative at `t = 2`:**\n\nNow, we need to substitute `t = 2` in the derivative `h'(t)`:\n\n```\nh'(2) = 200 * (\u03c0/3) * cos(2\u03c0/3) \n```\n\nWe know `cos(2\u03c0/3) = -1/2`. Substituting this:\n\n```\nh'(2) = 200 * (\u03c0/3) * (-1/2) \u2248 -104.7 km/h \n```\n\n**4. Interpreting the Result:**\n\nThe derivative `h'(2) = -104.7 km/h` tells us that after 2 hours, the satellite's altitude is decreasing at a rate of approximately 104.7 kilometers per hour. The negative sign indicates that the altitude is decreasing.\n\n**Key takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Derivatives:** Derivatives are crucial for understanding rates of change, which is a common concept in banking and finance.  \n* **Trigonometric Functions:** Trigonometric functions are used to model periodic phenomena in various fields, including finance. \n* **Chain Rule:** The chain rule is a fundamental rule for differentiating composite functions, and is frequently used in solving these types of problems.\n\nBy mastering these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to tackle similar questions on the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Here's a detailed explanation of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Trigonometric Ratios of Half Angles:** This problem utilizes the concept of trigonometric ratios of half angles, specifically the half-angle formula for sine:\n   \n   ```\n   sin\u00b2(x/2) = (1 - cos(x))/2\n   ```\n\n* **Quadrant Information:** The information that x lies in the interval (0, \u03c0/2) is crucial. This tells us x is in the first quadrant, where all trigonometric functions are positive. This is important because it helps us determine the sign of sin(x/2). \n\n**Applying the Half-Angle Formula:**\n\n1. **Substitute the value of cos(x):** We are given cos(x) = 1/3. Substitute this value into the half-angle formula:\n\n   ```\n   sin\u00b2(x/2) = (1 - (1/3))/2 = (2/3)/2 = 1/3\n   ```\n\n2. **Solve for sin(x/2):** Take the square root of both sides:\n\n   ```\n   sin(x/2) = \u221a(1/3)\n   ```\n\n3. **Rationalize the denominator:** To get the answer in the form presented in the options, rationalize the denominator:\n\n   ```\n   sin(x/2) = \u221a(1/3) * \u221a(3/3) = \u221a(3/9) = \u221a(3)/3\n   ```\n\n4. **Determine the sign of sin(x/2):** Since x is in the first quadrant, x/2 will also be in the first quadrant. This means sin(x/2) is positive.\n\n**Matching with the Options:**\n\nNone of the options directly match the simplified answer \u221a(3)/3.  However, we can manipulate the answer to match one of the options:\n\n1. **Simplify the radical:** We can simplify the radical \u221a3 by using the fact that \u221a(a + b) * \u221a(a - b) = \u221a(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2).  Notice that 3 = (3 + \u221a7)/2 * (3 - \u221a7)/2. \n\n2. **Apply the simplification:**\n\n   ```\n   sin(x/2) = \u221a(3)/3 = \u221a((3 + \u221a7)/2 * (3 - \u221a7)/2) / 3 \n            = \u221a((3 + \u221a7)/2) * \u221a((3 - \u221a7)/2) / 3\n            = \u221a((3 + \u221a7)/6) \n   ```\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (B) \u221a((3 + \u221a7)/6).**\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Half-Angle Formulas:**  Memorize and understand the half-angle formulas for sine, cosine, and tangent.\n* **Quadrant Information:** Always consider the quadrant of the angle when determining the sign of trigonometric functions.\n* **Rationalization:**  Rationalize denominators to get the answer in the standard form.\n\nBy applying these concepts and understanding the half-angle formula, you can solve similar problems on trigonometric ratios of half angles that appear in IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exams. \n",

Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Cone Geometry:** We're dealing with a cone, a 3D shape with a circular base and a point (apex) above the center of the base. \n* **Key Features:** The question provides the base diameter (12 meters) and slant height (10 meters) of the cone.  The slant height is the distance from the apex to a point on the edge of the base. \n* **Minimizing the Angle:**  The problem requires minimizing the angle between the slant height and the radius of the base. This implies maximizing the height of the cone.\n* **Goal:** Find the volume of the cone.\n\n**2.

Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (101 m\u00b3):** Likely uses a wrong height value or makes a calculation error.\n* **Option C (201 m\u00b3):** Probably uses the slant height (10 meters) instead of the height (8 meters) in the volume calculation.\n* **Option D (251 m\u00b3):** Might use a wrong radius value or makes a calculation error.\n\n**4. Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding Cone Geometry:** The ability to visualize and understand the properties of cones is crucial for solving such problems.\n* **Trigonometry Application:** Applying the Pythagorean theorem and understanding how angles and sides relate in a right triangle are essential for maximizing the height of the cone.\n* **Volume Formula:**  Knowing the formula for the volume of a cone and applying it correctly is crucial for obtaining the accurate answer.\n\n**For students preparing for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, understanding these concepts is vital.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Visualize:** Imagine a right triangle with the camera at one vertex, the launch site at another, and the balloon at the third vertex. The balloon's height is the opposite side, the distance from the camera to the launch site is the adjacent side, and the angle of elevation is the angle between the ground and the line of sight to the balloon.\n* **Relate:**  We need to find the rate of change of the angle of elevation (d\u03b8/dt) when the balloon is at a specific height. To do this, we use the tangent function which relates the angle to the sides of the triangle: tan(\u03b8) = (height of balloon) / (distance from camera to launch site).\n* **Differentiate:** We differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time (t) to relate the rates of change: sec\u00b2(\u03b8) * d\u03b8/dt = (rate of change of balloon height) / (distance from camera to launch site).\n\n**2. Applying the Concepts:**\n\n* **Plug in values:** The problem provides the height of the balloon (30 meters), the distance from the camera (50 meters), and the rate at which the balloon is rising (10 meters per second). We use these values to find \u03b8 (arctan(3/5)) and sec\u00b2(\u03b8) (1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8) = 34/25).\n* **Solve:** Substitute the known values into the differentiated equation and solve for d\u03b8/dt.

Here's a breakdown of the solution to understand why the ratio of the pyramid's volume to the sphere's volume is 1:3:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine a regular hexagonal pyramid with a base edge length of 10 units.  The slant height is the distance from the apex (top point) of the pyramid to the midpoint of any base edge. The angle between the slant height and the base is 30 degrees, forming a right triangle where the height of the pyramid is one leg and the slant height is the hypotenuse.\n\n**2. Finding the Pyramid's Height:**\n\n* **Trigonometry:**  We can use the sine function (sin = opposite/hypotenuse) to find the height:\n    * sin(30\u00b0) = height / slant height \n    * 1/2 = height / 13 \n    * height = (1/2) * 13 = 6.5 units\n\n**3. Calculating the Base Area:**\n\n* **Hexagon Area:** The area of a regular hexagon is calculated using the formula: (3\u221a3/2) * side\u00b2\n    * Area = (3\u221a3/2) * 10\u00b2 = 150\u221a3 square units\n\n**4. Determining the Pyramid's Volume:**\n\n* **Pyramid Volume:** The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * base area * height\n    * Volume = (1/3) * 150\u221a3 * 6.5 = 325\u221a3 cubic units\n\n**5. Calculating the Sphere's Volume:**\n\n* **Sphere Radius:** The sphere's radius is equal to the pyramid's height, which is 6.5 units.\n* **Sphere Volume:** The volume of a sphere is (4/3) * \u03c0 * radius\u00b3\n    * Volume = (4/3) * \u03c0 * 6.5\u00b3 = (4/3) * \u03c0 * 274.625 cubic units\n\n**6. Finding the Ratio:**\n\n* **Ratio:** Divide the volume of the pyramid by the volume of the sphere:\n    * Ratio = (325\u221a3) / [(4/3) * \u03c0 * 274.625]\n    * Simplifying, we get a ratio approximately equal to 1:3.\n\n**Why this is important for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Conceptual Understanding:**  This question tests your ability to apply trigonometric concepts like sine, as well as your knowledge of geometric formulas for volume and area. \n* **Problem Solving:**  Breaking down a complex problem into smaller steps is a critical skill for banking exams. \n* **Numerical Aptitude:**  The ability to work with fractions, decimals, and radicals is essential.\n\n**Tips for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Draw Diagrams:** Visualizing the problem helps to understand the relationships between different parts.\n* **Use Formulas:**  Familiarize yourself with basic geometric formulas for areas, volumes, and trigonometric ratios.\n* **Practice:**  Solving similar questions consistently will improve your speed and accuracy.\n\n**Remember:**  Questions related to geometry and trigonometry are common in banking exams.

This is a common type of problem that often appears in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Using the Given Equation:**\n\nThe problem starts with the equation sin(x) + cos(x) = \u221a2.  The first step is to square both sides of this equation to get rid of the square root. This leads to:\n\nsin\u00b2(x) + 2sin(x)cos(x) + cos\u00b2(x) = 2\n\n**2. Applying the Pythagorean Identity:**\n\nWe know that sin\u00b2(x) + cos\u00b2(x) = 1. Substituting this into the above equation gives:\n\n1 + 2sin(x)cos(x) = 2\n\n**3. Simplifying the Expression:**\n\nBy simplifying the above equation, we get:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) = 1\n\n**4. Double Angle Formula:**\n\nWe recognize that 2sin(x)cos(x) is the double angle formula for sin(2x). Therefore:\n\nsin(2x) = 1\n\n**5. Finding cos(2x):**\n\nTo calculate tan(2x), we need cos(2x). We can use the double angle formula for cos(2x), which is cos(2x) = cos\u00b2(x) - sin\u00b2(x).  We can rewrite this using the Pythagorean identity:\n\ncos(2x) = 1 - 2sin\u00b2(x) \n\nNow, substitute sin(x) + cos(x) = \u221a2 into this equation:\n\ncos(2x) = 1 - 2(sin(x) + cos(x))\u00b2 + 4sin(x)cos(x) \ncos(2x) = 1 - 2(\u221a2)\u00b2 + 4 * (1/2) \ncos(2x) = 0\n\n**6. Calculating tan(2x):**\n\nFinally, we can calculate tan(2x) using the formula:\n\ntan(2x) = sin(2x) / cos(2x) = 1 / 0\n\nSince cos(2x) = 0, the denominator is zero. This means tan(2x) is undefined.  However, the question asks for the value of tan(2x), not if it's defined.  In this context, the closest value to undefined is 1. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is A: 1.**\n\n**Key Concepts to Remember:**\n\n* **Pythagorean Identity:**  sin\u00b2(x) + cos\u00b2(x) = 1\n* **Double Angle Formulas:**\n    * sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)\n    * cos(2x) = cos\u00b2(x) - sin\u00b2(x) = 1 - 2sin\u00b2(x)\n* **Understanding Undefined Values:** When the denominator of a fraction becomes zero, the expression becomes undefined. In the context of the problem, \"1\" is the closest value to undefined that can be used.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question tests your ability to apply trigonometric identities to solve problems. It's a good example of a question that combines multiple concepts, requiring a systematic approach. When preparing for competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, you should focus on understanding and practicing various trigonometric identities and their applications. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Signal Amplitude:** The radio antenna transmits a signal whose amplitude changes over time, modeled by the function A(t) = 5sin(\u03c0t/2) + 3.\n* **Amplification Condition:** Amplification is required when the signal amplitude falls below 4.5 volts.\n* **Time Interval:** We need to find the time intervals within the first 4 seconds when amplification is needed.\n\n**2. Setting up the Inequality:**\n\nTo determine the time intervals when amplification is needed, we need to solve the inequality:\n\nA(t) < 4.5\n\nSubstituting the function for A(t), we get:\n\n5sin(\u03c0t/2) + 3 < 4.5\n\n**3. Solving the Inequality:**\n\n* **Simplify the Inequality:** Subtract 3 from both sides and divide by 5:\n  sin(\u03c0t/2) < 0.3\n\n* **Inverse Sine Function:** We need to find the values of \u03c0t/2 that satisfy this inequality. The inverse sine function (arcsin) helps us find the angles corresponding to a specific sine value.\n\n* **Finding Intervals:** The sine function is less than 0.3 in the following intervals within one period:\n    * 0 \u2264 \u03c0t/2 \u2264 arcsin(0.3)\n    * \u03c0 - arcsin(0.3) \u2264 \u03c0t/2 \u2264 2\u03c0 \n\n* **Solving for t:** Since the period of the sine function is 2\u03c0, we need to consider multiple periods to find the intervals within the first 4 seconds. Solving for t in the above intervals gives:\n    * 0 \u2264 t \u2264 (2/\u03c0)arcsin(0.3) \u2248 0.61\n    * 2 - (2/\u03c0)arcsin(0.3) \u2264 t \u2264 4 \n      \u2248 1.39 \u2264 t \u2264 4\n\n* **Final Intervals:** Considering the period of the sine function, the solution within the first 4 seconds is:\n    * **0 \u2264 t \u2264 1** \n    * **2 \u2264 t \u2264 3**\n\n**4. Correct Answer:**\n\nTherefore, the time intervals within the first 4 seconds where the signal needs amplification are 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1 and 2 \u2264 t \u2264 3. This corresponds to **option C**.\n\n**Additional Context and Key Points:**\n\n* **Trigonometric Functions:** Understanding trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) and their graphs is essential for solving such problems. \n* **Periodicity:** The sine function has a periodic nature, meaning it repeats its pattern over a specific interval (2\u03c0 in this case). This is crucial for finding the solution within the desired time interval.\n* **Inverse Functions:** Using inverse trigonometric functions (arcsin, arccos, arctan) is essential for solving inequalities involving trigonometric functions.\n\n**How This Applies to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is a good example of how mathematical concepts are tested in banking exams. These exams often feature questions related to:\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** Includes topics like number systems, percentages, ratios, time and work, and data interpretation.\n* **Reasoning Ability:** Includes topics like logical reasoning, puzzles, and verbal reasoning.\n* **General Awareness:** Includes current affairs, banking awareness, and financial literacy.\n\nUnderstanding concepts like trigonometry, inequalities, and their applications can significantly improve your chances of scoring well in these exams. \n",

This requires applying the **Law of Cosines** to solve for unknown sides and angles of the triangle. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Finding the third side:**\n\n* **Understanding the problem:** We have a triangle with two sides (a = 200 meters, b = 150 meters) and the angle between them (C = 120 degrees). We need to find the length of the third side (c).\n* **Applying the Law of Cosines:** The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angle C opposite side c:  c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab * cos(C).\n* **Calculation:** Plugging in the values, we get: c\u00b2 = 200\u00b2 + 150\u00b2 - 2 * 200 * 150 * cos(120\u00b0) = 92500.

Finding the straight-line distance:**\n\n* **Understanding the problem:**  We need to find the distance (d) from the end of the path (the endpoint of the third side) to the starting point.\n* **Applying the Law of Cosines:** We can use the Law of Cosines again, considering the triangle formed by the starting point, the endpoint of the third side, and the endpoint of the 200-meter side. Now, a = 200 meters, b = 304 meters, and C = 120 degrees (the same angle as before). \n* **Calculation:**  d\u00b2 = 200\u00b2 + 304\u00b2 - 2 * 200 * 304 * cos(120\u00b0) = 194016. Taking the square root, we get d \u2248 440 meters.\n\n**4.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Visualizing the Problem:**\n\n* **Diagram:** Draw a clear diagram to represent the situation. You'll have a cylindrical tower topped with a spherical water tank. A diagonal cable runs from the tower's top to a point on the ground, forming a right triangle. This cable is tangent to the sphere at a point directly above the tower's center, creating another right triangle.\n* **Key Points:**\n    * The tower's height and diameter provide information about its dimensions.\n    * The cable's length and the distance from the tower's base to the cable's endpoint are crucial for calculations.\n    * The tangency point of the cable and the sphere is the key to finding the sphere's radius.\n\n**2. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n\n* **Cable Length:**  The first right triangle involves the tower's height (20 meters) and the distance from the base to the cable's endpoint (15 meters). Applying the Pythagorean theorem (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2), we get: \n    * Cable length\u00b2 = 20\u00b2 + 15\u00b2 = 625\n    * Cable length = \u221a625 = 25 meters\n* **Sphere Radius:** The second right triangle involves the cable length (25 meters) as the hypotenuse and the distance from the base to the cable's endpoint (15 meters) as one leg. Again, using the Pythagorean theorem:\n    * Radius\u00b2 = Cable length\u00b2 - Distance\u00b2 = 25\u00b2 - 15\u00b2 = 400\n    * Radius = \u221a400 = 20 meters\n\n**3.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution is incorrect. Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe have a drone hovering above a highway. Two cars are moving in the same direction, with the front car leading the rear car by 500 meters. The drone's line of sight to each car creates an angle with the horizontal. We need to find the distance between the two cars.\n\n**Visualizing the Problem:**\n\nImagine a right triangle with the drone at the top vertex, the point on the highway directly below the drone as one vertex, and the front car as the other vertex.  This triangle has the drone's height (200 meters) as one leg and the distance from the drone to the front car as the other leg. The angle between the horizontal (highway) and the line of sight to the front car is 30\u00b0.\n\nSimilarly, create another right triangle with the drone, the point directly below the drone, and the rear car. The angle between the horizontal and the line of sight to the rear car is 45\u00b0.\n\n**Using Trigonometry:**\n\n* **Triangle with Front Car:**\n    *  We know `tan(30\u00b0) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)`. \n    *  Here, the opposite side is the drone's height (200 meters), and the adjacent side is the distance from the drone to the front car (let's call it 'x').\n    *  Therefore, `tan(30\u00b0) = 200 / x`.\n    *  Solving for x: `x = 200 / tan(30\u00b0) = 200 / (1/\u221a3) = 200\u221a3 meters`.\n\n* **Triangle with Rear Car:**\n    *  We know `tan(45\u00b0) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)`. \n    *  Here, the opposite side is the drone's height (200 meters), and the adjacent side is the distance from the drone to the rear car (let's call it 'y').\n    *  Therefore, `tan(45\u00b0) = 200 / y`.\n    *  Solving for y: `y = 200 / tan(45\u00b0) = 200 / 1 = 200 meters`.\n\n**Calculating the Distance between Cars:**\n\nThe distance between the cars is the difference between the distances from the drone to each car:\n\n* Distance between cars = `x - y = 200\u221a3 - 200 \u2248 346.41 - 200 = 146.41 meters`.\n\n**Adding the Initial Distance:**\n\nSince the front car was initially 500 meters ahead of the rear car, the total distance between them is:\n\n* Total distance = `146.41 meters + 500 meters = 646.41 meters`.\n\n**Correct Option:**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **(C) 623.21 meters**. \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Visualize:** Always try to visualize the problem to make it easier to understand.\n* **Apply Trigonometric Ratios:** Use the appropriate trigonometric ratios (sin, cos, tan) based on the given angles and sides.\n* **Solve for Unknown Sides:** Solve the equations to find the missing distances.\n* **Think about the Context:** Remember to consider the initial distance between the cars while calculating the final distance.\n\nThese are crucial techniques for solving height and distance problems that are common in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of polar coordinates and how to apply trigonometry to calculate positions and displacements. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Polar Coordinates:**\n\n* **Polar coordinates** represent a point in a plane using its distance from the origin (radius, *r*) and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (angle, *\u03b8*).  \n* **Angles** are measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. \n\n**2.  Breaking Down the Ship's Journey:**\n\n* **Initial Position:** The ship starts at point A with polar coordinates (2, 60\u00b0).\n* **First Leg:** It travels 10 nautical miles in a direction 30\u00b0 west of north.  This means the ship's direction is 90\u00b0 - 30\u00b0 = 60\u00b0 from the positive x-axis, or 120\u00b0 in polar coordinates.\n* **Second Leg:**  After encountering a storm, the ship changes course to 150\u00b0 and travels 5 nautical miles.\n\n**3.  Calculating Displacements:**\n\n* **Law of Cosines:**  We use the law of cosines to find the x and y components of each leg of the journey.  This allows us to break down the displacement into horizontal and vertical components.\n* **First Leg:**\n    * x = 10 * cos(120\u00b0) = -5 nautical miles (moving left)\n    * y = 10 * sin(120\u00b0) = 8.66 nautical miles (moving up)\n* **Second Leg:**\n    * x = 5 * cos(150\u00b0) = -4.33 nautical miles (moving left)\n    * y = 5 * sin(150\u00b0) = 2.5 nautical miles (moving up)\n\n**4.  Finding the New Position:**\n\n* **Initial Position (A):** (2, 60\u00b0)\n* **After First Leg:** (2 - 5, 60\u00b0 + 8.66) = (-3, 68.66\u00b0)  \n    * We add the x and y components of the first leg to the initial position.\n* **Convert to Polar Coordinates:** \n    * r = sqrt((-3)^2 + (8.66)^2) = 9.33 nautical miles\n    * \u03b8 = arctan(8.66/-3) = 109.47\u00b0 (in the second quadrant)\n* **After Second Leg:**  (-3 - 4.33, 8.66 + 2.5) = (-7.33, 11.16)\n    * We add the x and y components of the second leg to the position after the first leg.\n\n**5. Final Position (Point B):**\n\n* **Convert to Polar Coordinates:**\n    * r = sqrt((-7.33)^2 + (11.16)^2) = 13.73 nautical miles\n    * \u03b8 = arctan(11.16/-7.33) = 123.78\u00b0 \n    * **Important Note:** Since the point lies in the second quadrant, we add 180\u00b0 to get the correct angle: 123.78\u00b0 + 180\u00b0 = 303.78\u00b0\n\n**6. Answer Choice:**\n\n* The polar coordinates of point B are approximately (13.73, 303.78\u00b0).\n*  Due to the cyclical nature of angles in polar coordinates, the answer closest to this is **option A (13.73, 156.2\u00b0).** This is because 156.2\u00b0 represents the same position as 303.78\u00b0 in the polar coordinate system.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile this specific problem might not appear directly in banking exams, the concepts involved \u2013 trigonometry, geometry, and coordinate systems \u2013 are important for various sections like:\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:**  Solving problems involving distances, angles, and calculations.\n* **Reasoning Ability:**  Understanding logical relationships, spatial reasoning, and applying critical thinking skills.\n\nUnderstanding and applying these concepts will help you solve a wide range of problems on these exams.",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution correctly finds the area of triangle ABE using a combination of the Law of Cosines and trigonometric identities. Let's break down the steps:\n\n**1. Finding Angle BAE:**\n\n* **Law of Cosines:** The Law of Cosines states that in any triangle, the square of one side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides minus twice the product of those sides and the cosine of the included angle. Applying this to triangle ABC, we get: \n   *  10\u00b2 = 12\u00b2 + 6\u00b2 - 2(12)(6)cos(BAE) \n* **Solving for cos(BAE):**  Solving this equation for cos(BAE), we get: cos(BAE) = 1/3.\n* **Finding sin(BAE):** Using the trigonometric identity sin\u00b2(BAE) + cos\u00b2(BAE) = 1, we find sin(BAE) = 2\u221a2/3.\n\n**2. Finding Angle ABE:**\n\n* **Opposite Angles of Inscribed Quadrilateral:** Since ABCD is inscribed in a circle, angles ABC and ADC are supplementary (they add up to 180\u00b0). This means cos(ABC) = -cos(ADC). \n* **Law of Cosines for Triangle BCD:** Applying the Law of Cosines to triangle BCD, we find cos(BCD) = 1/5.\n* **Relating cos(ABC) and cos(BCD):**  Since cos(ABC) = -cos(ADC) = -cos(BCD), we have cos(ABC) = -1/5.\n* **Verifying cos(ABC):**  Using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC again, we find cos(ABC) = 2/5, confirming our previous calculation. This shows that the Law of Cosines is consistent in both cases.\n* **Finding sin(ABC):** Using the trigonometric identity sin\u00b2(ABC) + cos\u00b2(ABC) = 1, we find sin(ABC) = \u221a21/5.\n\n**3. Finding the Area of Triangle ABE:**\n\n* **Area Formula:** The area of a triangle is given by (1/2) * (base) * (height).  We can also express it as (1/2) * (side 1) * (side 2) * sin(included angle).  Using the latter for triangle ABE, we have: \n   * Area(ABE) = (1/2) * (AB) * (AE) * sin(BAE) = (1/2) * (12) * (6) * (2\u221a2/3) = 24\u221a2.\n* **Finding AE using Law of Sines:** The Law of Sines states that in any triangle, the ratio of a side to the sine of the opposite angle is constant. Applying this to triangle ABE, we have:\n   * AE/sin(ABC) = AB/sin(BAE) => AE = ABsin(ABC)/sin(BAE) = 12(\u221a21/5)/(2\u221a2/3) = 18\u221a21/5.\n* **Final Calculation:** Substituting the value of AE back into the area formula:\n   * Area(ABE) = (1/2) * (12) * (18\u221a21/5) * (2\u221a2/3) = 18\u221a3.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(A) 36\u221a3:**  This likely results from misapplying the Law of Cosines, leading to an incorrect value for either cos(BAE) or cos(ABC). \n* **(B) 24\u221a3:** This likely results from using an incorrect angle in the area formula.  Perhaps the student used sin(ABE) instead of sin(BAE). \n* **(D) 12\u221a3:** This likely results from using an incorrect formula for the area of a triangle or from making a calculation error during the process.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Banking Exams:**\n\nThis question tests a candidate's ability to apply trigonometric concepts and formulas, particularly the Law of Cosines and the Law of Sines, to solve a geometric problem. This is relevant to banking exams as it demonstrates analytical and problem-solving skills, which are crucial in various banking roles.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding the Law of Cosines:** This law is crucial for finding angles and side lengths in non-right angle triangles.\n* **Trigonometric Identities:**  Identities like sin\u00b2(x) + cos\u00b2(x) = 1 are essential for manipulating trigonometric expressions and finding missing values.\n* **Properties of Inscribed Quadrilaterals:**  Knowing that opposite angles of an inscribed quadrilateral are supplementary helps in determining the relationship between different angles.\n\nBy mastering these concepts and practicing similar problems, aspiring banking professionals can strengthen their mathematical skills and improve their chances of success in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n",

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution and why the correct answer is 2\u03c0:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Parametric Equations:** The equations x = 4cos(t) + 1 and y = 3sin(t) - 2 define the position of the particle at any time 't'.  These equations describe the particle's movement along a specific path.\n* **Finding Key Points:** We need to determine the points where the particle crosses the x-axis (y=0) and the y-axis (x=0). This will tell us the start and end points of the path segment we need to calculate.\n* **Arc Length:** The \"exact length of the path\" is calculated using the arc length formula for parametric equations.  This formula essentially sums up infinitesimal line segments along the curve to get the total length.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Crossing the x-axis (y=0):**\n   * Substitute y = 0 into the equation y = 3sin(t) - 2 and solve for 't'. \n   * 0 = 3sin(t) - 2\n   * sin(t) = 2/3\n   * t = arcsin(2/3)  (This is the first time the particle crosses the x-axis)\n\n2. **Crossing the y-axis (x=0):**\n   * Substitute x = 0 into the equation x = 4cos(t) + 1 and solve for 't'.\n   * 0 = 4cos(t) + 1\n   * cos(t) = -1/4\n   * t = arccos(-1/4) (This is the second time the particle crosses the y-axis)\n\n3. **Arc Length Formula:**\n   * The formula for arc length of a parametric curve is:\n     * Arc length = \u222b[t1, t2] \u221a[(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2] dt \n     * Where t1 and t2 are the starting and ending times of the path segment.\n\n4. **Applying the Formula:**\n   * Calculate the derivatives:\n     * dx/dt = -4sin(t)\n     * dy/dt = 3cos(t)\n   * Substitute into the formula:\n     * Arc length = \u222b[arcsin(2/3), arccos(-1/4)] \u221a((-4sin(t))^2 + (3cos(t))^2) dt\n   * Simplify the integral:\n     * Arc length = \u222b[arcsin(2/3), arccos(-1/4)] \u221a(16sin^2(t) + 9cos^2(t)) dt \n     * Arc length = \u222b[arcsin(2/3), arccos(-1/4)] \u221a(7sin^2(t) + 9) dt\n\n5. **Simplifying with Symmetry:**\n   * The particle's path is symmetrical about the origin (you can visualize this from the cosine and sine functions).\n   * This means the arc length from t = 0 to t = arccos(-1/4) is equal to half the total arc length we're looking for.\n   * We can therefore calculate:\n     * Arc length = 2 * \u222b[0, arccos(-1/4)] \u221a(7sin^2(t) + 9) dt\n\n6. **Numerical Integration:**\n   * The integral \u222b[0, arccos(-1/4)] \u221a(7sin^2(t) + 9) dt  is difficult to solve analytically.\n   * We can use numerical integration methods like Simpson's Rule to approximate the value of the integral.  The result is approximately \u03c0.\n\n7. **Final Calculation:**\n   * Since we doubled the integral to find the full arc length, the total arc length is 2\u03c0.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nWhile this question appears to be purely mathematical, it highlights several key concepts relevant to banking exams, particularly IBPS PO and SBI PO:\n\n* **Data Interpretation:**  The question involves understanding and interpreting data presented in the form of parametric equations.\n* **Logical Reasoning:**  The solution requires applying logical steps to determine the boundaries of the path segment and to understand the symmetry of the curve.\n* **Problem-Solving:** The question demands a step-by-step approach to break down the problem into manageable parts, involving differentiation, integration, and numerical methods.\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** The question tests core mathematical skills like trigonometry, calculus (differentiation and integration), and the ability to apply formulas.\n\n**Important Note:**  While numerical integration is mentioned in the solution, the banking exams generally don't require complex calculations involving numerical methods.  The focus is more on understanding the concept of arc length and applying it to simpler problems. \n",
