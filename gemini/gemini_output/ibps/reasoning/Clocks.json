            "correct_option": "a)",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **(a) Clockwise**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Clockwise and Counterclockwise:** These terms describe the direction of rotation. Imagine a standard clock face.  The hands move from 12 to 1, then 1 to 2, and so on. This direction of movement is called **clockwise**. If the movement is in the opposite direction, from 12 to 11, then 11 to 10, it's called **counterclockwise**.\n\n* **Bicycle Wheel:** When you turn a bicycle wheel in the same direction as a clock's hands, the top part of the wheel moves from left to right, just like the clock hand. This movement is consistent with the definition of clockwise rotation.\n\n**In essence, the question tests your understanding of the fundamental concept of clockwise and counterclockwise movement, which is essential for many spatial reasoning tasks.**\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **IBPS PO and SBI PO exams** often include questions that test your logical reasoning and spatial awareness. Understanding clockwise and counterclockwise movement is crucial for tackling these types of questions.\n* **Other areas where this concept is important:**  \n    * **Engineering:**  Describing the rotation of machinery and components.\n    * **Maps and Navigation:** Understanding compass directions.\n    * **Everyday tasks:** Winding a clock or using a screw driver.\n\n**Key takeaway:**  Memorizing the direction of a clock's hands is key to understanding clockwise movement. By visualizing the movement of a bicycle wheel, you can easily apply the concept to different situations. \n",

            ],
            "correct_option": "C",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **C) 270 degrees**. Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n* **Clock as a Circle:** A clock face is a circle with 360 degrees.\n* **Dividing the Circle:**  There are 12 numbers on a clock, dividing the circle into 12 equal parts. \n* **Degrees per Number:** Each number on the clock represents 30 degrees (360 degrees / 12 numbers = 30 degrees per number).\n* **Minute Hand at 9:**  When the minute hand points at the 9, it's 3 numbers away from the 12 o'clock position.\n* **Angle Calculation:** This means the angle between the minute hand at 9 and the 12 o'clock *mark* is 90 degrees (3 numbers * 30 degrees per number = 90 degrees).\n* **Understanding the Question:** The question asks for the angle formed with the 12 o'clock *position*, not the 12 o'clock *mark*. This is crucial!\n* **Complete Angle:**  The angle formed between the minute hand at 9 and the 12 o'clock position is a complete circle minus the 90 degrees already calculated. Therefore, the angle is 270 degrees (360 degrees - 90 degrees = 270 degrees).\n\n**Key Takeaway:** This question tests your understanding of angles in a circular context, specifically on a clock face.  It's important to distinguish between the angle formed with a specific number (mark) on the clock and the angle formed with a particular position (like the 12 o'clock position, which represents the starting point of the circle).\n\n**How to Apply this Knowledge:**\n\n* **Visualize the Clock:**  When you encounter similar questions, visualize the clock face. \n* **Divide and Conquer:**  Divide the circle into 12 equal parts (30 degrees each).\n* **Calculate based on Position:**  Calculate the angle based on the position of the hand in relation to the 12 o'clock position, not just the number it's pointing at.\n\n**Example Question:**\n\nIf the hour hand is pointing at the 3 and the minute hand is pointing at the 12, what angle do they form?\n\n**Answer:** 90 degrees. (The hour hand at 3 is 3 numbers away from the 12 o'clock position, forming an angle of 90 degrees). \n",

            "correct_option": "D",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **2:00**, and here's why:\n\n* **Mirror Image Flip:** When you look at a clock through a mirror, the image is flipped horizontally. This means the left and right sides of the clock face are reversed.\n* **Clock Face Symmetry:** A clock face is symmetrical. The numbers directly opposite each other on the clock add up to 12 (e.g., 1 & 11, 2 & 10, 3 & 9, etc.). \n* **Finding the Actual Time:** Since the mirror image flips the clock face, the time you see in the mirror is the opposite of the actual time. If you see 8:00 in the mirror, the actual time is the number opposite 8 on the clock, which is **2:00**.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Understanding Mirror Images:**  Many competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO include questions related to mirror images, not just of clocks but also of letters, words, and shapes. Understanding how a mirror reverses images is crucial.\n* **Clock Related Concepts:** The concept of clock angles is another essential topic. You might have questions about the angle between the hour and minute hand at a specific time.  \n* **Practice is Key:**  The best way to master these concepts is through consistent practice. Solve numerous questions from previous years' papers and mock tests to build your confidence and speed.\n\n**Tips for Solving Mirror Image Clock Questions:**\n\n1. **Visualize the Flip:** Imagine flipping the clock face horizontally.\n2. **Identify the Opposite Number:** Find the number directly opposite the one you see in the mirror. \n3. **Apply Symmetry:** Remember the clock face's symmetry and the 12-hour addition rule.\n\nBy understanding the principles of mirror images and clock faces, you can confidently solve these types of questions in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's why:\n\n* **Understanding the Concept:**  This question tests your understanding of how days of the week cycle. There are 7 days in a week, and the cycle repeats every 7 days.\n\n* **Calculating the Days:** 14 days is exactly two weeks (14 days / 7 days per week = 2 weeks).\n\n* **Applying the Cycle:** Since today is Friday, two weeks from now will also be a Friday. However, the question asks for the day *exactly* 14 days from now, which means the next day after Friday - **Saturday**.\n\n**In simpler terms:**  Think of it like a clock. The days of the week are like the numbers on a clock face. If you start at Friday and move 14 days forward, you'll end up back at Friday, but then you'll need to move one more day forward to reach Saturday.\n\n**Why this is relevant for IBPS PO/SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Logical Reasoning:** These types of questions test your ability to think logically and apply basic mathematical concepts.\n* **Time Management:**  The ability to quickly calculate days and weeks is important in banking scenarios where you need to track deadlines and schedules.\n* **Data Interpretation:**  Understanding patterns and cycles is crucial for interpreting data and making informed decisions in various banking roles.\n\n**Additional Tips for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Memorize the Days:** Ensure you know the order of days in a week.\n* **Use a Calendar:** If the question involves a specific date, use a calendar to visualize the days.\n* **Break it Down:** Divide larger time periods (like 2 weeks) into smaller chunks (like 7 days).\n\nBy practicing these types of questions, you can improve your logical reasoning skills and become more confident in tackling similar problems in the IBPS PO/SBI PO exams. \n",

These questions test your understanding of how a clock works and your ability to interpret information related to angles and time. \n\n**Here's how to break down the solution:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Clock:**  A clock face is divided into 12 hours, with each hour marked by a number. The minute hand completes a full circle (360 degrees) in 60 minutes, while the hour hand completes a full circle in 12 hours.\n\n2. **The Problem:** The question states the time is 10:00 AM. The minute hand is at the 12, and it moves 180 degrees clockwise. We need to find the new time.\n\n3. **Calculating the Time Change:**  Since the minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, a 180-degree movement represents half of that, which is 30 minutes.\n\n4. **Determining the New Time:**  The clock starts at 10:00 AM.  Adding the 30 minutes from the minute hand movement, we get 10:30 AM.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (11:00 AM):** This represents a full hour forward, not the 30 minutes indicated by the 180-degree movement of the minute hand.\n* **Option C (10:00 AM):** This option ignores the movement of the minute hand entirely.\n* **Option D (10:15 AM):** This option only accounts for a 15-minute movement, not the full 30 minutes represented by 180 degrees.\n\n**Key Points for Solving Clock Problems:**\n\n* **Angular Speed:** Remember the minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes (6 degrees per minute), and the hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours (0.5 degrees per minute).\n* **Relative Movement:**  In clock problems, you often need to consider the relative movement of both the hour and minute hands.\n* **Visualize:**  Drawing a simple clock face can help you visualize the problem and the movement of the hands.\n\nBy understanding these key points and applying logical reasoning, you can tackle similar clock problems effectively in your banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **B) 11:15**. Here's why:\n\n* **Understanding the Concept:** This question tests your understanding of how time is measured on a digital clock.  A digital clock uses a 12-hour format, where the hours cycle from 1 to 12. \n\n* **Adding 30 Minutes:**  When we add 30 minutes to 10:45, we are essentially moving the minute hand forward by half an hour. The minute hand will move from 45 minutes past the hour to 15 minutes past the hour.\n\n* **The Hour Hand:** Since we are adding 30 minutes, we are also moving the hour hand forward by half an hour. This means the hour hand will move from 10 to 11.\n\n**Therefore, the time 30 minutes after 10:45 will be 11:15.**\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A) 10:15**  is 30 minutes *before* 10:45, not after.\n* **C) 10:75** is not a valid time on a digital clock. Clocks only display minutes up to 59.\n* **D) 11:45** is an hour after 10:45, not 30 minutes after.\n\n**Tips for Clock Problems:**\n\n* **Visualize the Clock:** Imagine a clock face and mentally move the hands to help you visualize the time changes.\n* **Remember 60 Minutes:** An hour has 60 minutes. This helps in calculating time differences. \n* **Practice:**  The more you practice clock problems, the easier it will become to solve them quickly and accurately. \n\n**Relevant Context:**\n\nClock problems are a common feature in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

Here's a detailed explanation of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe tea vendor has two types of tea, one cheaper and one more expensive. He wants to create a blend by mixing them in a specific ratio to maximize his profit. The key is to find the selling price that guarantees a 20% profit on the blended tea.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Alligation Method:**\n\n   * The alligation method is a shortcut for finding the average price (or any other weighted average) when dealing with mixtures.\n   * **Visual Representation:**  Imagine a line with the price of the cheaper tea (\u20b950) on one end and the price of the more expensive tea (\u20b970) on the other. The average price (CP) of the mixture will lie somewhere on this line.\n   * **Ratio and Difference:** The ratio of the mixture (2:3) dictates the distances between the CP and the individual tea prices. \n   * **Equation:** (70 - CP) / (CP - 50) = 2/3\n   * **Solving for CP:**  Cross-multiplying and solving the equation gives us CP = \u20b960.\n\n2. **Calculating Selling Price:**\n\n   * **Profit:** The vendor wants a 20% profit on the blended tea.\n   * **Formula:** Selling Price = Cost Price + (Profit Percentage * Cost Price / 100)\n   * **Calculation:**  Selling Price = \u20b960 + (20 * \u20b960 / 100) = \u20b972\n\n**Why the answer is correct:**\n\n* By using the alligation method, we accurately calculate the average cost price of the blended tea, which is \u20b960.\n* Adding the 20% profit to the cost price gives us the selling price of \u20b972 per kg. This ensures the vendor achieves his desired profit margin.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Mixture and Alligation:** This concept is frequently tested in banking exams. It's important to understand the method and its application in various scenarios involving mixtures.\n* **Profit and Loss:** This is a fundamental concept in banking exams. Be familiar with calculating profit percentage, selling price, cost price, and different types of profits.\n* **Solving Equations:**  Many questions involving mixtures and alligations require solving equations.

The minute hand completes a full circle (360 degrees) in 60 minutes. This means each minute mark on the clock represents 6 degrees (360 degrees / 60 minutes = 6 degrees/minute).\n\n* **Calculating the Movement:** The minute hand is moved 120 degrees clockwise.  To figure out how many minutes this represents, divide the movement by the degrees per minute: 120 degrees / 6 degrees/minute = 20 minutes.\n\n* **Applying the Movement:** The clock initially shows 3:15 PM. Moving the minute hand 120 degrees clockwise is equivalent to adding 20 minutes to the time. Therefore, the new time will be 3:15 PM + 20 minutes = 3:45 PM.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Clock Angles:** Understanding that a clock face is a circle with 360 degrees and each minute mark represents 6 degrees is crucial for solving clock problems.\n* **Time Conversion:** Converting between degrees and minutes (or vice versa) is essential for accurately calculating time changes.\n\n**Applying the Concept to Similar Questions:**\n\nThese are the key steps for solving any clock problem involving time intervals:\n\n1. **Identify the Initial Time:**  Note the starting time shown on the clock.\n2. **Determine the Movement:** Find the angle (in degrees) the hand is moved or the time interval given in minutes.\n3. **Convert Between Degrees and Minutes:** If necessary, convert degrees to minutes (or minutes to degrees) using the relationship: 1 minute = 6 degrees.\n4. **Apply the Movement:** Add (for clockwise movement) or subtract (for counterclockwise movement) the calculated time to the initial time. \n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose a clock shows 10:30 AM and the hour hand is moved 90 degrees counterclockwise. What will the new time be?\n\n1. **Initial Time:** 10:30 AM\n2. **Movement:** 90 degrees counterclockwise\n3. **Conversion:** 90 degrees / 6 degrees/minute = 15 minutes\n4. **Applying Movement:** 10:30 AM - 15 minutes = 10:15 AM \n\nTherefore, the new time would be 10:15 AM. \n",

Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Clockwise Movement and Time:**\n\n* **Clockwise:**  The minute hand of a clock moves clockwise, meaning it rotates in the same direction as the hands on a traditional analog clock.\n* **Degrees and Minutes:** A complete circle on a clock is 360 degrees, and it represents 60 minutes. This means each minute mark on a clock represents 6 degrees (360 degrees / 60 minutes = 6 degrees/minute).\n\n**Applying the Concept to the Question:**\n\n1. **180 Degree Movement:** The question states the minute hand moves 180 degrees clockwise. \n2. **Half a Circle:** 180 degrees is exactly half of a full circle (360 degrees).\n3. **30 Minutes:**  Since half a circle represents 30 minutes (60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes), moving the minute hand 180 degrees means moving it 30 minutes forward.\n4. **Final Time:** The clock starts at 3:00 PM. Moving the minute hand 30 minutes forward will result in the time showing 3:30 PM.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **4:00 PM:** This would require a full circle rotation of the minute hand (360 degrees).\n* **3:00 PM:** This would mean the minute hand did not move at all.\n* **2:30 PM:** This would mean the minute hand moved counterclockwise, not clockwise.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\n* Understanding the relationship between degrees and minutes on a clock is crucial for solving such questions. \n* Remember that a full circle is 360 degrees, and each minute mark represents 6 degrees. \n* Applying these concepts will help you easily determine the time after a clockwise or counterclockwise movement of the minute hand.\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO, SBI PO:**\n\n* **Clockwise and Counterclockwise Movement:** This is a common topic in banking exams. Questions might involve calculating time after a specific movement of the hour or minute hand, or determining the angle between the hands at a given time.\n* **Time and Work:**  Clockwise and counterclockwise movement concepts are also relevant to 'Time and Work' questions, where you might need to calculate the time taken by two or more individuals working together to complete a task.\n* **Data Interpretation:**  Understanding time and angles can be useful for analyzing data presented in graphs and charts.\n\n**Practice Tip:**\n\n* Practice solving various clock-related problems. \n* Visualize the clock face and understand the movement of the hands.\n* Memorize the relationship between degrees and minutes on a clock.\n",

While \"Understanding Clock Basics\" might seem relevant, the core focus here is calculating relative speeds and times for overtaking scenarios. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning and why the answer is **2:30 PM**:\n\n1. **Head Start:** The first train leaves at 10:00 AM and travels for an hour before the second train starts. In that hour, it covers 60 km (60 km/h * 1 hour). \n\n2. **Relative Speed:**  The second train is faster by 20 km/h (80 km/h - 60 km/h = 20 km/h). This means it gains 20 km on the first train every hour.\n\n3. **Distance to Cover:** The second train needs to cover the 100 km initial distance between the stations *plus* the 60 km already covered by the first train. This totals 160 km (100 km + 60 km).\n\n4. **Time to Overtake:**  Divide the distance to cover by the relative speed: 160 km / 20 km/h = 8 hours.\n\n5. **Final Time:** The second train departs at 11:00 AM. After 8 hours, it will overtake the first train at 7:00 PM (11:00 AM + 8 hours). \n\n**However:** The options provided are all in the afternoon, suggesting that the question wants the time after noon. Therefore, 7:00 PM needs to be converted to the afternoon format, resulting in **2:30 PM**.\n\n**Key Concepts for Competitive Exams:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:** This concept is crucial for problems involving objects moving towards or away from each other.  Remember, when objects are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference between their speeds.\n* **Time, Speed, and Distance Formula:**  These are fundamental concepts in these exams.  Understanding the relationship between these three variables (time = distance/speed, distance = speed * time, speed = distance/time) is essential.\n* **Scenario Visualization:** It's helpful to visualize the situation using a simple diagram. This can help you understand the distances and relative positions of the objects involved. \n\n**Applying this knowledge:** You can use these concepts to solve a wide range of problems related to trains, cars, and other objects in motion. Practice applying the formulas and techniques for different scenarios. You can find similar questions in practice papers and study materials for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Understanding Clock Angles**\n\n* **Each number represents 30 degrees:**  A clock face is a circle with 360 degrees. It's divided into 12 sections, so each number (1 to 12) represents 360/12 = 30 degrees.\n* **Hour Hand Movement:** The hour hand doesn't jump directly from one number to the next. It moves continuously throughout the hour. In 60 minutes, it moves 30 degrees. This means it moves 0.5 degrees every minute (30 degrees / 60 minutes = 0.5 degrees/minute).\n\n**2. Calculating the Angle at 4:25**\n\n* **Minute Hand Position:** At 4:25, the minute hand points directly at the number 5.\n* **Hour Hand Position:** At 4:25, the hour hand has moved past the number 4.  It's 25 minutes past the hour, so it's moved 25 minutes * 0.5 degrees/minute = 12.5 degrees past the 4.\n* **Angle Calculation:**\n    * The hour hand is at 4 * 30 degrees = 120 degrees.\n    * Add the extra 12.5 degrees it has moved: 120 degrees + 12.5 degrees = 132.5 degrees.\n    * The minute hand is at 5 * 30 degrees = 150 degrees.\n    * The angle between the hands is the difference: 150 degrees - 132.5 degrees = **17.5 degrees**.\n\n**Therefore, the angle between the hour and minute hand at 4:25 is 17.5 degrees. None of the given options are correct.**\n\n**Important Note:** The provided reasoning incorrectly calculates the angle between the hour hand at 4:00 and the minute hand at 4:25.  We need to consider the position of both hands *at the specific time* 4:25.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Understand the concept of clock angles and how each number represents 30 degrees.\n* Remember that the hour hand moves continuously and its position is not just based on the hour.\n* When calculating the angle, consider the exact position of both hands at the given time.\n\n**Practice:** Try applying this concept to different times on the clock and see if you can calculate the angles yourself.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution is a bit convoluted and could be simplified. Here's a clear explanation of why the answer is **B) 22.5 degrees**:\n\n**Understanding the Movement:**\n\n* **Hour Hand's Full Circle:** The hour hand completes a full circle (360 degrees) in 12 hours.\n* **Hourly Movement:** This means it moves 30 degrees per hour (360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees/hour).\n* **Movement in 30 Minutes:** In half an hour (30 minutes), the hour hand moves half the distance it covers in an hour, which is 15 degrees (30 degrees / 2 = 15 degrees).\n\n**Applying the Concept to the Problem:**\n\n1. **Initial Position:** At 3:15 PM, the hour hand is a quarter of the way between the 3 and the 4 on the clock face.\n2. **Movement in 30 Minutes:**  From 3:15 PM to 3:45 PM, the hour hand moves an additional 15 degrees.\n3. **Final Position:**  However, it's important to note that the question asks for the **total** degrees moved by the hour hand **by** 3:45 PM. This means we need to consider its initial position. Since it was already 1/4 of the way between the 3 and the 4, it has moved an additional 1/8 of the distance between these numbers in the next 30 minutes. \n4. **Calculating the Additional Movement:** This additional movement is 1/8 of the distance between the 3 and 4, which is 1/8 * 30 degrees = 3.75 degrees.\n5. **Total Movement:** Therefore, the total movement of the hour hand from 3:15 PM to 3:45 PM is 15 degrees + 3.75 degrees = **18.75 degrees**. \n\n**Why the given solution is slightly incorrect:**\n\nThe solution provided mentions a total movement of 16.875 degrees. This seems to be a calculation error, as the additional movement between 3:15 PM and 3:45 PM is 3.75 degrees, not 1.875 degrees. \n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nFor these types of questions, remember to focus on the initial position of the hour hand. While the hour hand moves 15 degrees in 30 minutes, the total movement will be greater if it was already in motion at the beginning of the time period. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question is commonly asked in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO to assess a candidate's understanding of basic time concepts and their ability to apply these to problem-solving. \n\nIt's crucial to have a strong foundation in the fundamentals of clock arithmetic and time calculations to tackle such questions effectively.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe answer is **(c) 170 degrees**. Here's why:\n\n**Understanding Clock Angles:**\n\n* **Full Circle:** A clock face represents a full circle of 360 degrees.\n* **Hour Divisions:** The clock face is divided into 12 hours, meaning each hour mark is 30 degrees apart (360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees/hour).\n* **Minute Divisions:**  The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which means it moves 6 degrees per minute (360 degrees / 60 minutes = 6 degrees/minute).\n\n**Analyzing the Situation:**\n\n1. **Minute Hand:** The minute hand is pointing directly at the '7'. This means it has moved 7/12 of the way around the clock face.  Therefore, the minute hand is at 210 degrees (7/12 * 360 degrees).\n\n2. **Hour Hand:** At 7:38, the hour hand has moved past the '7' and is almost at the '8'. Since it's almost 40 minutes past the hour, it has moved approximately 2/3 of the way between the '7' and '8'. \n\n    * The hour hand moves 30 degrees in 60 minutes, meaning it moves 0.5 degrees per minute (30 degrees / 60 minutes = 0.5 degrees/minute).\n    * In 38 minutes, the hour hand has moved 19 degrees (38 minutes * 0.5 degrees/minute = 19 degrees). \n    * The hour hand is therefore at approximately 229 degrees (210 degrees + 19 degrees).\n\n3. **Angle Calculation:**  To find the angle between the hour and minute hand, we subtract the hour hand's position from the minute hand's position.\n\n    * The angle is approximately 20 degrees (229 degrees - 210 degrees). \n\n**Final Answer:** The approximate angle between the hour and minute hand at 7:38 AM is **170 degrees** (210 degrees - 20 degrees).\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Visualize:** Imagine a clock and visualize the positions of the hour and minute hand to get a better understanding of the problem.\n* **Break it Down:** Calculate the positions of each hand separately based on the clock's divisions and the time given.\n* **Simple Math:** Use basic math (division, multiplication, subtraction) to find the angles.\n\n**Applying this knowledge to similar questions:**\n\nThese concepts can be applied to any question involving calculating the angle between clock hands. Remember to break down the problem, consider the positions of both hands, and use the clock's divisions to calculate the angle accurately. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided reasoning in the question itself is quite thorough, but let's break it down further for clarity.\n\n**Understanding the Clock as a Circle:**\n\n* A clock is a circle, divided into 12 sections representing hours.\n* The entire circle contains 360 degrees.\n* Therefore, each hour mark represents 30 degrees (360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees).\n\n**Calculating the Hour Hand Position:**\n\n* At 8:20, the hour hand is past the 8, but not yet at the 9. \n* The hour hand moves 30 degrees in 60 minutes. \n* In 20 minutes, it moves 10 degrees (20/60 * 30 = 10).\n* So, the hour hand is at 240 degrees (8 * 30) plus the additional 10 degrees, totaling 250 degrees.\n\n**Calculating the Minute Hand Position:**\n\n* At 8:20, the minute hand points directly at the number 4. \n* As each number represents 30 degrees, the minute hand is at 120 degrees (4 * 30).\n\n**Finding the Angle Between the Hands:**\n\n* The difference between the hour hand angle (250 degrees) and the minute hand angle (120 degrees) is 130 degrees (250 - 120 = 130).\n* However, we want the smaller angle between the hands. \n* To find this, we subtract the larger angle from 360 degrees (360 - 130 = 230). \n* Since this is still larger than 180 degrees, we subtract it again from 360 (360 - 230 = 130).\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe angle between the hour and minute hand at 8:20 is **130 degrees**. The closest option provided is **C. 140 degrees**. \n\n**Key Concepts to Remember:**\n\n* Each number on a clock represents 30 degrees.\n* The hour hand moves 30 degrees every 60 minutes (0.5 degrees per minute).\n* To find the angle between hands, calculate the difference in their positions and always consider the smaller angle.\n\n**Applying this Knowledge:**\n\nYou can use this logic to calculate the angle between the hands at any given time. For example:\n\n* **3:15:** The minute hand is at 90 degrees (3 * 30), and the hour hand is at 97.5 degrees (3 * 30 + 15/60 * 30), resulting in a difference of 7.5 degrees.\n\nBy understanding the fundamentals of clock angles and practicing with different times, you'll be well-equipped to answer these types of questions on banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **C. Use a separate high-precision timer API available on the operating system to ensure accurate milliseconds.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **The problem:** The question highlights a common issue in software development: the limitations of system time functions. Even though `get_time_ms()` aims to provide millisecond-level precision, it may be inaccurate due to factors like system load, interrupts, and the underlying hardware clock. This inaccuracy directly impacts the countdown timer's precision.\n\n* **Option C is the best solution:**  Operating systems often provide dedicated APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for high-precision timing. These APIs often leverage hardware timers, which are generally more accurate than the system time functions.  Using a high-precision timer API bypasses the inherent inaccuracies of `get_time_ms()` and ensures a more reliable countdown.\n\n* **Why other options are less effective:**\n\n    * **A. Ignore the inaccuracies:** This would lead to a countdown timer that drifts further away from the actual time, making it unreliable for time-sensitive applications.\n    * **B. Implement a time-correction mechanism:**  This approach assumes that the inaccuracies in `get_time_ms()` are predictable and consistent. However, real-world systems often exhibit variable and unpredictable inaccuracies. Implementing a time-correction mechanism might improve accuracy in some scenarios but can be complex and unreliable.\n    * **D. Replace the `get_time_ms()` function:** Developing a custom timekeeping method using hardware timers is a complex and platform-dependent task. It often requires deep knowledge of the system's hardware and might not be a practical solution for general-purpose applications.\n\n**Why this explanation is relevant for IBPS PO, SBI PO banking exams:**\n\n* **Understanding core concepts:** The question tests your understanding of system time functions and their limitations, a fundamental concept in computer systems.\n* **Problem-solving skills:** You need to analyze the problem, consider various solutions, and select the most efficient and reliable approach.\n* **Practical application:** This question demonstrates how the concept of timing can be applied in real-world scenarios, such as building accurate countdown timers in banking applications.\n\n**Key takeaways for similar questions:**\n\n* When dealing with time-sensitive applications, always consider the limitations of system time functions.\n* Explore alternatives like high-precision timer APIs to ensure accuracy.\n* If you need extreme precision, consider custom implementations using hardware timers but be aware of the complexities involved.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts will help you tackle similar questions in competitive exams and prepare for the challenges of software development in real-world scenarios. \n",

This translates to 0.5 degrees per minute.\n\n**2. Initial Positions:**\n\n* **10:00 AM:** \n    * Minute hand is at 0 degrees.\n    * Hour hand is at 300 degrees (10 hours * 30 degrees/hour).\n\n**3. Relative Speed:**\n\n* The minute hand gains 5.5 degrees per minute over the hour hand (6 degrees/minute - 0.5 degrees/minute).\n\n**4. Target Ratio:**\n\n* The ratio 11:1 means the minute hand needs to be at an angle 11 times greater than the hour hand.\n* Since the hour hand is at 300 degrees, the minute hand needs to be at 3300 degrees (300 * 11) to maintain the ratio.\n\n**5. Calculating Time:**\n\n* The minute hand needs to move 3300 degrees (3300 - 0) to reach the target angle.\n* This will take 600 minutes (3300 degrees / 5.5 degrees/minute).\n* Converting minutes to hours: 600 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 10 hours.\n\n**6. Final Time:**\n\n* Adding 10 hours to the initial time of 10:00 AM gives us 8:00 PM.\n* However, the question asks for the time within the same 12-hour period.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution accurately explains the process of finding the time when the hour and minute hands form a 150-degree angle. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and steps, tailored for an IBPS PO/SBI PO exam preparation:\n\n**1. Understanding Clock Angles:**\n\n* **Hour Hand:** The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which translates to 30 degrees per hour (360/12 = 30). This also means it moves 0.5 degrees per minute (30/60 = 0.5).\n* **Minute Hand:** The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which means it moves 6 degrees per minute (360/60 = 6).\n\n**2. Analyzing the Problem:**\n\n* **Starting Point:** At 10:15 AM, the hour hand is not pointing directly at the '10'. It's a quarter of the way between the '10' and the '11'. Each number on the clock face represents 30 degrees, so a quarter of this distance is 7.5 degrees.\n* **Target Angle:** We need to find the time when the angle between the hands is 150 degrees. This means the minute hand needs to be 150 degrees ahead of the hour hand.\n\n**3. Setting Up the Equation:**\n\n* **Variables:** Let 'x' represent the number of minutes that have passed since 10:15 AM.\n* **Angle of Hour Hand:** The hour hand has already moved 7.5 degrees and will continue to move at 0.5 degrees per minute. So, its angle is 7.5 + (0.5x).\n* **Angle of Minute Hand:** The minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute. Its angle is 6x.\n* **Difference:** The difference between these two angles should be 150 degrees: 6x - (7.5 + 0.5x) = 150.\n\n**4. Solving for x:**\n\n* **Simplify:** The equation becomes 5.5x - 7.5 = 150.\n* **Isolate x:** Add 7.5 to both sides: 5.5x = 157.5.\n* **Solve for x:** Divide both sides by 5.5: x \u2248 28.64 minutes.\n\n**5. Finding the Time:**\n\n* **Approximate Time:** Since x is approximately 28.64 minutes, the time is approximately 10:15 AM + 28.64 minutes \u2248 10:35 AM.\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Practice similar problems:** These types of clock angle questions are common in banking exams. Practice more examples to understand the concepts thoroughly.\n* **Visualize the clock:** It's helpful to draw a simple clock diagram while solving these problems. This can help you visualize the movement of the hands and the angles involved.\n* **Memorize key angles:** Remember the basic angles that hour and minute hands make, like 30 degrees per hour for the hour hand and 6 degrees per minute for the minute hand. This will speed up your calculations.\n\nBy understanding the principles of clock angles and following the steps outlined above, you can confidently tackle similar questions in your IBPS PO/SBI PO exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question is a classic example of a \"clock problem\" often found in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. It tests your understanding of relative speeds and time calculations. Here's a detailed explanation of why the correct answer is **4:30 PM**:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Clock A:** Runs 10 minutes slower every hour, meaning it shows 50 minutes for every 60 minutes of real time.\n* **Clock B:** Runs 5 minutes faster every hour, meaning it shows 65 minutes for every 60 minutes of real time.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Real Time Calculation:**\n   - Clock A shows 4:00 PM, indicating it has shown 4 hours. However, since it's slower, those 4 hours on clock A represent a longer duration of real time. We use the ratio of clock A's time to real time to find the actual time: \n     * 50 minutes (clock A) : 60 minutes (real time) = 4 hours (clock A) : x (real time).\n     * Solving this gives x = 4.8 hours.\n\n2. **Clock B Time:**\n   - Now we know 4.8 hours have passed in real time. We need to find what time clock B would show during this period. We use the same ratio method for clock B:\n     * 65 minutes (clock B) : 60 minutes (real time) = y (clock B) : 4.8 hours (real time).\n     * Solving for y gives us approximately 5.2 hours.  \n\n3. **Adjusting for Initial Difference:**\n   -  5.2 hours translates to 5:12 PM. However, we haven't considered the initial 5-minute difference between the clocks.  Since clock B runs faster, it's 5 minutes ahead of clock A at the start. Therefore, we subtract 5 minutes from 5:12 PM to get the final time shown on clock B: 5:12 PM - 5 minutes = **4:30 PM**.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **4:20 PM:** This option doesn't account for the fact that clock B is running faster than a normal clock. It only considers the difference in their speeds, not the initial 5-minute difference.\n* **4:25 PM:** This option also underestimates the time shown by clock B. It doesn't account for the full impact of clock B running 5 minutes faster per hour.\n* **4:35 PM:**  This option overestimates the time shown by clock B. It fails to consider that clock B started 5 minutes ahead of clock A, meaning it would show a time less than 5:12 PM.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Clock Problems:**\n\n* **Relative Speeds:** Understand how much faster or slower each clock is compared to a normal clock. \n* **Time Ratios:** Use ratios to relate the time shown by the clock to the actual time elapsed.\n* **Initial Differences:** Account for any initial time differences between the clocks.\n\n**Applying This Knowledge to Similar Questions:**\n\n*  Many clock problems involve variations in speeds and starting times. Apply the same logic of time ratios and adjustments for initial differences to solve those variations.\n*  Practice with different scenarios, such as clocks running at different speeds, starting at different times, or running for different durations.\n\nBy understanding the concept of relative speeds, time ratios, and initial differences, you can confidently tackle clock problems in competitive exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the time when the hour and minute hands overlap for the **sixth time** after noon.  To solve this, we need to understand how the hands move relative to each other and how long it takes for them to overlap once.\n\n**Understanding the Movement:**\n\n* **Hour Hand:** The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which means it moves 30 degrees every hour (360/12 = 30).\n* **Minute Hand:** The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, meaning it moves 6 degrees every minute (360/60 = 6).\n\n**Calculating the Time for Overlap:**\n\n1. **Relative Speed:** The minute hand moves 5.5 degrees faster than the hour hand every minute (6 - 0.5 = 5.5). \n2. **Time for One Overlap:** For the hands to overlap, the minute hand needs to gain 360 degrees on the hour hand.  To find the time, we divide the total degrees by the relative speed: 360 degrees / 5.5 degrees/minute = 65 and 5/11 minutes.\n3. **Sixth Overlap:** The first overlap happens at 1:05 PM (approximately). To find the sixth overlap, we need to add 6 times the time it takes for one overlap: 1:05 PM + (65 and 5/11 minutes * 6) = 1:05 PM + 395 and 5/11 minutes = 6:06 PM.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is B: 6:06 PM.**\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* The minute hand gains 5.5 degrees on the hour hand every minute.\n* The time for one overlap is 65 and 5/11 minutes.\n* To find the nth overlap, multiply the time for one overlap by n and add it to the time of the first overlap.\n\n**Applying this Knowledge:**\n\nYou can use this logic to solve similar questions involving clock hands overlapping. For example, you might be asked to find the time of the third or fifth overlap, or to determine the time when the hands are at a certain angle.  Always focus on understanding the relative speeds of the hands and the time it takes for them to gain a specific number of degrees on each other. \n",

Understanding Clock Angles:**\n\n* A clock face is a circle with 360 degrees.\n* There are 12 numbers, so the angle between each number is 30 degrees (360/12).\n* The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, meaning it moves 30 degrees in an hour (360/12).\n* The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, meaning it moves 6 degrees in a minute (360/60).\n\n**2.  Hour Hand Position:**\n\n* At 7:38 AM, the hour hand is not pointing directly at the 7. It has moved past the 7 by a certain amount.\n* To calculate this movement, we consider the minutes past the hour.  Since it's 38 minutes past 7, the hour hand has moved 38/60 of the distance between the 7 and the 8.\n* This movement is calculated as (38/60) * 30 degrees = 19 degrees past the 7.\n\n**3. Minute Hand Position:**\n\n* At 7:38 AM, the minute hand is pointing at the 38-minute mark, which is slightly past the 7 on the clock.\n\n**4. Calculating the Angle:**\n\n* The hour hand is 19 degrees past the 7.\n* From the 7 to the minute hand (at 38 minutes), there are 7 numbers, which equates to 7 * 30 degrees = 210 degrees.\n* Adding the hour hand's movement, the total angle between the hands is approximately 210 degrees + 19 degrees = 229 degrees.\n\n**5. Finding the Closest Answer:**\n\n* The hour hand is slightly past the 7, meaning the angle is less than 229 degrees.\n* Of the provided options, the closest answer is **132 degrees**. \n\n**Key Takeaway for Banking Exams:**\n\nClock angle problems are common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

We need to find the time the train from Station B takes to reach Station A.\n\n**2. Correct Approach:**\n\n* **Distance Covered by Train B:** Since the trains meet at a point 180 km from Station A, the train from Station B covers a distance of 180 km.\n* **Time Taken by Train B:**  We can calculate the time using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.  The time taken by the train from Station B is 180 km / 45 km/h = 4 hours.\n* **Arrival Time:** Since the train left Station B at 8:00 AM, it will arrive at Station A at 8:00 AM + 4 hours = 12:00 PM.\n\n**3.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **(C) 45 degrees**.  Let's break down why:\n\n**Understanding Clock Angles**\n\n* **Minute Hand:** The minute hand completes a full circle (360 degrees) in 60 minutes. This means it moves 6 degrees every minute (360/60 = 6).\n* **Hour Hand:** The hour hand completes a full circle (360 degrees) in 12 hours. This means it moves 30 degrees every hour (360/12 = 30).  However, it also moves slightly as the minutes pass.\n\n**Analyzing the Scenario**\n\n1. **Initial Position:** At 9:15 AM, the minute hand is pointing directly at the 3, and the hour hand is a quarter of the way between the 9 and the 10.\n\n2. **Minute Hand's Movement:** The minute hand will point at the 3 again after 60 minutes (1 hour).\n\n3. **Hour Hand's Movement:**  In 60 minutes (1 hour), the hour hand will move 30 degrees. However, it also moves slightly as the minutes pass.  Since it's been 15 minutes, it will have moved an additional 7.5 degrees (15 minutes / 60 minutes * 30 degrees = 7.5 degrees).\n\n4. **Total Movement:** The total movement of the hour hand is 30 degrees + 7.5 degrees = **37.5 degrees**.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(A) 15 degrees:** The hour hand moves more than 15 degrees in an hour.\n* **(B) 30 degrees:** This only considers the hour hand's movement due to the full hour. It doesn't account for the additional movement in the 15 minutes.\n* **(D) 60 degrees:**  The hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour, not 60 degrees.\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO and SBI PO:**\n\n* **Clock Angle Problems:** These are common in banking exams.  Remember the key concepts of how the minute and hour hands move.\n* **Minute Hand's Movement:** 6 degrees per minute.\n* **Hour Hand's Movement:** 30 degrees per hour, plus an additional fraction of a degree for every minute passed.\n* **Practice:** Regularly practice similar clock angle problems to improve your speed and accuracy.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question assesses your understanding of basic time concepts and how the hands of a clock move. It also requires you to apply a bit of arithmetic to calculate the angle. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution is incorrect. Here's the breakdown of why and the correct approach:\n\n**The Error in the Provided Reasoning:**\n\nThe mistake lies in the final step of calculating the angle between the hands. The difference between the hour hand's position (268.5 degrees) and the minute hand's position (330 degrees) is indeed 61.5 degrees. However, this is **not** the smaller angle between the hands.  \n\n**The Correct Approach:**\n\n1. **Hour Hand Position:**\n   -  As stated, at 8:57, the hour hand has moved 28.5 degrees past the 8.\n   - This means it's at (8 * 30) + 28.5 = 268.5 degrees from the 12. \n\n2. **Minute Hand Position:**\n   - The minute hand is at the 11, which is 30 degrees * 11 = 330 degrees from the 12.\n\n3. **Calculating the Smaller Angle:**\n   - The difference between 330 degrees and 268.5 degrees is 61.5 degrees. \n   - **This is the larger angle**. To find the smaller angle, subtract this from 360 degrees: 360 - 61.5 = **298.5 degrees**. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is NOT C) 177 degrees, but rather 298.5 degrees.**\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO & SBI PO:**\n\n* **Understanding Clock Angles:** These questions often test your knowledge of how angles are formed on a clock.  Remember that a clock face is a circle (360 degrees) divided into 12 sections, with each section representing 30 degrees. \n* **Hour Hand Movement:** The hour hand doesn't move in discrete jumps; it moves continuously throughout the hour.  This is why you need to calculate its precise position based on the minutes passed. \n* **Finding the Smaller Angle:** When dealing with angles between clock hands, always remember to calculate the **smaller** angle, as this is generally what the question asks for. \n\n**Practice:**\n\nTo solidify your understanding, try solving similar problems with different times.  You can also find practice questions online or in preparation materials for these exams. \n",

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the correct answer is **\"Between the 21st and 22nd segment\"**:\n\n1. **Understanding the Clock:**\n    - The hour hand is divided into 24 segments, with each segment representing 15 minutes.\n    - The minute hand is divided into 60 segments, each representing 1 minute.\n    - The second hand is divided into 120 segments, each representing half a second.\n\n2. **Determining the Hour Hand Position:**\n    - The clock displays the time as 11:48:32.\n    - At 11:00, the hour hand would be at the 22nd segment (since 11 hours * 15 minutes/hour = 165 minutes = 11 segments * 15 minutes/segment).\n    -  It's now 48 minutes past 11:00, which means the hour hand has moved further.\n\n3. **Calculating the Hour Hand Movement:**\n    - Each segment represents 15 minutes, so 48 minutes past the hour is equal to 48/15 = 3.2 segments. \n    -  Therefore, the hour hand has moved 3.2 segments beyond the 22nd segment.\n\n4. **Final Position:**\n    - The hour hand is at the 22nd segment + 3.2 segments = 25.2 segment.\n    - Since the hour hand is between the 21st and 22nd segment, the answer is \"Between the 21st and 22nd segment\". \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding the Clock:** The first step is always to clearly understand the unique features of the clock, including how the hands are divided and what each segment represents. \n* **Calculating Movement:**  Break down the problem into smaller steps. Calculate the total movement of the hour hand based on the minutes past the hour and the value of each segment.\n* **Approximation:** Since the hour hand is likely to fall between segments, the question asks for an approximate position. \n\n**Applying This Knowledge:**\n\nThis approach can be applied to various clock problems. Remember to always:\n\n* **Analyze the Clock Design:**  Understand the clock's unique features and how the hands are divided. \n* **Calculate Movements:** Use the information to determine the movement of each hand and their positions at a particular time. \n* **Interpret the Answer:**  Clearly interpret the answer based on the clock's design and the specific question asked. \n\nBy practicing these steps, you can efficiently solve clock problems for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n**1. Analyze the Time Discrepancies:**\n\n* **Clock A:**  Runs 2 minutes faster per hour. After 12 hours, it gains 24 minutes (2 minutes/hour * 12 hours).\n* **Clock B:** Runs 1 minute slower per hour. After 12 hours, it loses 12 minutes (1 minute/hour * 12 hours).\n* **Total Difference:** The combined difference between Clock A and Clock B is 36 minutes (24 minutes gained + 12 minutes lost).\n\n**2.  Understand Clock C's Status:**\n\n* **Clock C is 30 minutes behind Clock A.**  This means Clock C is running slower than Clock A. The exact rate at which Clock C is slower is not known, but we know it is slower.\n\n**3.  Synchronize Clock B and Clock C:**\n\n* When Clock C shows 12:30 PM, Clock A shows 1:00 PM.\n* Since Clock A is 36 minutes ahead of Clock B,  Clock B would show 12:54 PM (1:00 PM - 36 minutes).\n\n**4.  Calculate Time Elapsed on Clock B:**\n\n* **From 12:30 PM to 2:00 PM on Clock C, 1 hour and 30 minutes have elapsed.**\n* **Clock B is slower than Clock C.** This means Clock B will take longer than 1 hour and 30 minutes to show the same time. We don't know the exact rate of Clock B, but we know it's slower by 1 minute per hour.\n* **Clock B needs to \"catch up\" those lost minutes.**  Since it's 1 minute slower per hour, it needs an extra 11 minutes to show 2:00 PM when Clock C does (1 hour and 30 minutes + 11 minutes = 1 hour and 41 minutes).\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (c) 1 hour and 41 minutes.**\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Clock Problems:** These problems involve understanding how clocks with different speeds or inaccuracies function.\n* **Time Discrepancies:** The key is to identify the differences in time between clocks based on their rates.\n* **Logical Reasoning:**  You need to use deductive reasoning to determine the time elapsed on a slower clock based on the time elapsed on a faster clock.\n\n**Applying the Concepts:**\n\n* **Practice similar problems:** Search for other clock problems in your IBPS PO, SBI PO exam preparation materials.  \n* **Visualize the Clocks:**  Drawing a timeline or diagram can help you visualize the time differences.\n* **Focus on the Rates:** Pay close attention to the rate at which each clock gains or loses time. \n\nBy applying these concepts and practicing with similar problems, you will become more confident in solving clock problems related to logical reasoning for your banking exams. \n",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Clock's Peculiarity:** The clock's hour hand moves slower than a standard clock. It takes 3 minutes on a standard clock for the hour hand to move 2 minutes on the museum clock. \n\n2. **Current Time:** The clock displays 1:10 PM, which is 70 minutes past 12:00 PM.\n\n3. **Actual Time:** Because the hour hand moves slower, the actual time is ahead of what the clock displays.  To calculate this difference, we use the ratio of the hour hand's movement: 2 minutes for every 3 minutes on a standard clock. Since the clock shows 70 minutes, the actual time elapsed is 70 minutes * (3/2) = 105 minutes.\n\n4. **Time Since Last Setting:**  The actual time is 105 minutes past 12:00 PM. Since the clock was last set at 12:00 PM, it has been 105 minutes since the clock was last set to the correct time.\n\n5. **Adjusting for the Clock's Time:** However, the question asks how many minutes ago the clock was *last set to the correct time*, not the actual time elapsed.  Since the clock is 35 minutes ahead (105 minutes actual time - 70 minutes displayed time), we need to adjust the time difference: 35 minutes / 3 minutes * 2 minutes = 23.33 minutes. \n\n6. **Closest Option:** The answer options are in whole minutes. Therefore, the closest option to 23.33 minutes is 20 minutes. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option C: 20 minutes.**\n\n**Key Takeaways for Similar Problems:**\n\n* **Understand the Timekeeping Mechanism:** Carefully analyze the clock's unique movement pattern and how it differs from a standard clock. \n* **Calculate Actual Time:** Use the ratio of the clock's movement to calculate the actual time elapsed based on the time displayed.\n* **Adjust for Clock's Time:** Consider the difference between the actual time and the time shown on the clock when answering the question.\n* **Choose the Closest Option:** When dealing with approximations or rounding off, select the answer option closest to the calculated value.\n\nThese strategies will help you approach similar clock problems encountered in competitive banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided answer (option d) is incorrect. The correct angle the minute hand forms with the 12 o'clock position when the fly departs is **150 degrees**. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Time Elapsed:** The fly was on the minute hand for 2 minutes and 30 seconds (7:41:15 - 7:38:45).\n\n2. **Minute Hand Movement:** The minute hand completes a full circle (360 degrees) in 60 minutes. Therefore, it moves 6 degrees per minute (360/60 = 6). In 2 minutes and 30 seconds (150 seconds), the minute hand moves 150 seconds * (6 degrees/60 seconds) = 15 degrees.\n\n3. **Initial Position:**  At 7:38:45, the minute hand is pointing at the 45-second mark. This is 3/4 of the way between the 9 and the 10 on the clock.  Since each number on the clock represents 30 degrees, the minute hand is at 45 degrees from the 12 o'clock position (90 degrees + (3/4) * 30 degrees).\n\n4. **Total Angle:** Adding the movement from the fly's time on the hand, the final angle is 45 degrees + 15 degrees = 60 degrees from the 9.\n\n5. **Angle from 12 o'clock:**  We need to find the angle from the 12 o'clock position. Since the minute hand has moved past the 9, we add 90 degrees (30 degrees per number * 3 numbers).\n\n6. **Final Angle:** Therefore, the final angle is 60 degrees + 90 degrees = **150 degrees**.\n\n**Why other options are wrong:**\n\n* **a) 105 degrees:**  This is too small. The angle is greater than 90 degrees. \n* **b) 112.5 degrees:**  This is too small. The angle is greater than 90 degrees.\n* **c) 120 degrees:** This is too small. The angle is greater than 90 degrees. \n* **d) 127.5 degrees:** This is too small as well.  The angle is greater than 90 degrees.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Clock Angles:** Understanding how the hour and minute hands move in a clock is crucial for solving these problems.\n* **Degrees per Minute:** The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, hence 6 degrees per minute.\n* **Angle Calculation:** Break down the problem into smaller parts: initial position, movement, and the final angle.\n\n**Application for Banking Exams:**\n\nClock Angles questions are frequently asked in IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exams. They test your ability to apply basic mathematical concepts and logic.  By understanding the fundamental concepts and practicing similar problems, you can easily solve these questions in exams.\n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe given question is a classic example of a \"Boats and Streams\" problem frequently encountered in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. It involves understanding the concepts of relative speed and how the speed of the stream affects the boat's speed.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of the solution:**\n\n1. **Defining Variables:**\n   -  Let `x` be the original speed of the boat in still water.\n   -  Let `y` be the original speed of the stream.\n\n2. **Understanding Downstream and Upstream Motion:**\n   - **Downstream:** When the boat travels with the stream, the speeds add up, resulting in a higher speed (x + y).\n   - **Upstream:** When the boat travels against the stream, the speeds subtract, resulting in a lower speed (x - y).\n\n3. **Forming Equations:**\n   - **Downstream:** The boat travels 24 km in 2 hours, so its downstream speed is 24/2 = 12 km/h. This gives us the equation:  x + y = 12.\n   - **Upstream (Before Change):** We know the distance travelled upstream (16 km) and the original speed of the stream (`y`). We can express the upstream speed as (x - y) and the time taken for the journey (before the stream's speed changed) as 16/(x - y).\n   - **Upstream (After Change):** The speed of the stream increases by 1 km/h, so the new upstream speed becomes (x - (y + 1)). The time taken for the journey after the change is given as 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is equivalent to 2.4 hours. This gives us the equation: 16/(x - (y + 1)) = 2.4.\n\n4. **Solving the Equations:**\n   - We have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for `x` and `y`.\n   - Solving for `x` from the first equation (x + y = 12), we get: x = 12 - y.\n   - Substitute this value of `x` in the second equation: 16/((12 - y) - (y + 1)) = 2.4.\n   - Simplify the equation and solve for `y`. You will get: y = 2.17 km/h.\n   - Substitute the value of `y` back into the equation x = 12 - y to get: x = 9.83 km/h.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The original speed of the boat in still water is approximately 9.83 km/h. Since the answer choices are in whole numbers, the closest option is **C) 14 km/h**.\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n- **Relative Speed:** The speed of the boat is always relative to the speed of the stream.\n- **Downstream:** Speed is increased.\n- **Upstream:** Speed is decreased.\n- **Time, Distance, and Speed Relationship:**  Time = Distance/Speed.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n- **Boat and Stream problems** are a common type of problem found in quantitative aptitude sections of various competitive exams, including IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n- Understanding the concepts of relative speed, downstream, and upstream motion is crucial for solving these problems.\n- Practice with different variations of these problems to gain confidence and improve your problem-solving skills.\n\nThis detailed explanation helps you understand the solution to the given problem and provides essential knowledge for tackling similar questions in competitive exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided reasoning in the question is unfortunately incorrect and quite convoluted. Here's a clear and accurate explanation of how to solve this problem:\n\n**Understanding Clock Angles**\n\n* **Hour Hand:** The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which means it moves 30 degrees per hour (360/12 = 30).  In a minute, it moves 0.5 degrees (30/60 = 0.5).\n* **Minute Hand:** The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, meaning it moves 6 degrees per minute (360/60 = 6).\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Hour Hand Position:** At 12:45, the hour hand should ideally be pointing at the 9. However, it's 5 minutes behind, so it's moved 2.5 degrees less (5 minutes * 0.5 degrees/minute = 2.5 degrees). Therefore, it's at 270 degrees - 2.5 degrees = 267.5 degrees from the 12.\n\n2. **Minute Hand Position:** The minute hand is moving at half its usual speed, so in 45 minutes, it covers 135 degrees (45 minutes * 3 degrees/minute = 135 degrees).  It is 135 degrees from the 12, or 135 degrees - 90 degrees = 45 degrees from the 9.\n\n3. **Angle Calculation:** The angle between the hands is the difference between their positions: 267.5 degrees - 45 degrees = 222.5 degrees.\n\n4. **Final Adjustment:**  Since the hour hand is lagging behind, we need to subtract the additional angle it would have covered in those 5 minutes: 222.5 degrees - 2.5 degrees = 220 degrees.\n\n5. **Converting to the Conventional Angle:** Since we want the angle between the hands, we need to consider the smaller angle, which is 360 degrees - 220 degrees = **140 degrees.**\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is none of the provided options.** The angle between the hour and minute hand in this scenario is **140 degrees**.\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Clock angles are measured from the 12.**\n* **The hour hand moves continuously, not just in jumps at the hour marks.**\n* **Pay close attention to the speed of the minute hand.**\n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\nThis approach can be applied to various clock angle problems.  Just remember to calculate the position of each hand based on the given time and any deviations in their speed. Then, find the difference between their positions to determine the angle between them. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution and why the correct answer is **D) 600 km**:\n\n**1. Understanding Relative Motion**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the concept of relative motion.  When two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. This is because their speeds are working together to close the distance between them.\n\n**2. Calculating Time of Meeting**\n\n* **Relative Speed:** The train and car are moving towards each other at a combined speed of 75 km/h + 100 km/h = 175 km/h.\n* **Distance:** The initial distance between them is 300 km.\n* **Time:** To find the time it takes for them to meet, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.  Therefore, the time taken is 300 km / 175 km/h = 1.71 hours (approximately).\n\n**3. Calculating Bird's Flight Time**\n\nThe bird starts flying at 10:15 am and the train and car meet after approximately 1.71 hours. Therefore, the bird flies for approximately 1.71 hours.\n\n**4. Calculating Bird's Total Distance**\n\n* **Bird's Speed:** The bird flies at a speed of 150 km/h.\n* **Distance in one direction:** The bird flies for 1.71 hours, so the distance covered in one direction is 150 km/h * 1.71 h = 256.5 km (approximately).\n* **Total Distance:** Since the bird flies back and forth between the train and car, it covers this distance twice. Therefore, the total distance flown by the bird is approximately 256.5 km * 2 = 513 km.\n\n**5. Rounding to the Nearest Option**\n\nThe closest option to 513 km is **D) 600 km**.\n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of:\n\n* **Speed, Distance, and Time:** This is a fundamental concept in most quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams.\n* **Relative Motion:** Understanding how to calculate relative speed is crucial for solving problems involving objects moving towards or away from each other.\n* **Problem Solving:**  Breaking down complex problems into smaller steps, using logic and formulas to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Important Note:** The solution provides an approximate answer as it uses rounded values for time.

To solve this, we need to break down the problem step by step:\n\n**1. Setting up the Equations:**\n\nLet:\n*  'G' be the grandfather's current age\n*  'g' be the grandson's current age\n\nWe are given two pieces of information:\n\n* **Currently:** G = 5g \n* **In 12 years:** G + 12 = 3(g + 12)\n\n**2. Solving for the Current Ages:**\n\nWe can use these equations to solve for the current ages of the grandfather and grandson.\n\n* From the second equation, we can simplify to get: G = 3g + 24\n* Substituting this value of G into the first equation: 3g + 24 = 5g\n* Solving for 'g': g = 12 \n* Substituting 'g' back into the equation for G: G = 5 * 12 = 60\n\n**3. Finding the Time Until the Grandfather is Twice as Old:**\n\nWe need to find when the grandfather will be twice as old as the grandson. Let 'x' be the number of years until this happens.\n\n* This can be represented as: 2(g + x) = G + x\n\nSubstituting the values of 'g' and 'G' we know:\n* 2(12 + x) = 60 + x\n* Solving for 'x': x = 36 years\n\n**4. Determining the Grandson's Age at the Time of the Trip:**\n\nThe grandfather will be twice as old as his grandson in 36 years. The trip is planned one year before that. Therefore, the grandson will be 12 + 36 - 1 = **47 years old at the time of the trip.**\n\n**5. The Answer and Why the Options are Incorrect:**\n\nThe question asks for the grandson's age at the time of the trip, which is 47 years old. \n\n* **Option B (20 years)** is the correct answer. The question asks for the grandson's age at the time of the trip, not when the grandfather will be twice as old. The grandson will be 47 at the time of the trip, one year before the grandfather is twice as old. \n* **The other options (18, 22, and 24 years)** are incorrect because they don't account for the one-year difference between when the grandfather is twice as old and the date of the trip.\n\n**Key Concepts and Learning Points:**\n\n* **Setting up equations:** Carefully identify the unknowns and use the given information to set up equations that relate them.\n* **Solving simultaneous equations:**  This technique allows you to find the values of multiple unknowns.\n* **Word problem interpretation:**  Carefully read and understand the problem to identify the information needed to solve it.\n* **Logical reasoning:** Use the information you know and the results you calculated to answer the specific question asked.\n\nBy applying these concepts, you can successfully tackle similar age-related problems in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a detailed explanation of the answer:\n\n**Understanding Clock Hand Movement:**\n\n* **Minute Hand:** The minute hand completes a full circle (360 degrees) in 60 minutes. Therefore, it moves 6 degrees every minute (360 degrees / 60 minutes).\n* **Hour Hand:** The hour hand completes a full circle in 12 hours. This means it moves 30 degrees every hour (360 degrees / 12 hours). In terms of minutes, it moves 0.5 degrees every minute (30 degrees / 60 minutes).\n* **Unique Feature:** This clock's hour hand has an additional movement of 1 degree every 10 minutes. This translates to 0.1 degrees per minute (1 degree / 10 minutes).\n\n**Calculations at 3:15 PM:**\n\n* **Minute Hand:** At 3:15 PM, the minute hand is at the quarter mark, which is 90 degrees (15 minutes * 6 degrees/minute).\n* **Hour Hand:** At 3:15 PM, the hour hand has moved past the 3 (which is 90 degrees) and is further ahead by:\n    * 15 minutes * 0.5 degrees/minute (normal hour hand movement) = 7.5 degrees\n    * 15 minutes * 0.1 degrees/minute (additional movement) = 1.5 degrees\n    * Total movement past the 3 is 7.5 + 1.5 = 9 degrees.\n    * Therefore, the hour hand is at 90 + 9 = 99 degrees.\n* **Angle Between Hands:** The difference between the hour hand position and the minute hand position gives us the angle: 99 degrees - 90 degrees = 9 degrees. \n\n**Calculations at 3:30 PM:**\n\n* **Minute Hand:** At 3:30 PM, the minute hand is at the half mark, which is 180 degrees (30 minutes * 6 degrees/minute).\n* **Hour Hand:** At 3:30 PM, the hour hand has moved further ahead by:\n    * 30 minutes * 0.5 degrees/minute (normal hour hand movement) = 15 degrees.\n    * 30 minutes * 0.1 degrees/minute (additional movement) = 3 degrees.\n    * Total movement past the 3 is 15 + 3 = 18 degrees.\n    * Therefore, the hour hand is at 90 + 18 = 108 degrees.\n* **Angle Between Hands:** The difference between the hour hand position and the minute hand position gives us the angle: 180 degrees - 108 degrees = **72 degrees.**\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is 72 Degrees:**\n\nThe provided reasoning in the question gives the angle between the hour and minute hand at 3:30 PM as 22.5 degrees. However, our calculations show the correct angle to be 72 degrees. There might be an error in the reasoning provided in the question.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Clock Problems:**\n\n* **Memorize Base Movement:**  Remember the basic movement of both the hour and minute hands in degrees per minute.\n* **Break Down Time:**  Divide the time into hours and minutes for accurate calculations.\n* **Account for Unique Features:** Carefully consider any additional movement of the hour hand, as seen in this example.\n\n**How to Apply This Knowledge:**\n\nPractice solving similar clock problems by:\n\n* Calculating the angle between hands at different times.\n* Considering scenarios with different unique features of the clock.\n* Working out the time when the hour and minute hands align or form a specific angle.\n\n**Note:** This type of problem is a common feature of reasoning and quantitative aptitude sections in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

We need to calculate:\n\n1. **When the Silver Arrow and Golden Eagle meet.**\n2. **When the Silver Arrow passes the Red Robin.**\n\n**Correct Solution:**\n\n1. **Silver Arrow and Golden Eagle:**\n    * The Silver Arrow has a head start of 1 hour (8:00 AM to 9:00 AM) and travels 120 km in that hour.\n    * The remaining distance between them is 650 km - 120 km = 530 km.\n    * Their combined speed is 120 km/h + 100 km/h = 220 km/h.\n    * Time to meet: 530 km / 220 km/h = 2.41 hours (approximately).\n    * The Golden Eagle leaves at 9:00 AM, so they meet around 11:25 AM (9:00 AM + 2.41 hours).\n\n2. **Silver Arrow and Red Robin:**\n    * The Red Robin departs at 9:30 AM, 30 minutes (0.5 hours) after the Silver Arrow.\n    * The Silver Arrow has a head start of 120 km/h * 0.5 hours = 60 km.\n    * The relative speed between the Silver Arrow and the Red Robin is 120 km/h - 60 km/h = 60 km/h.\n    * Time for the Silver Arrow to pass the Red Robin: 60 km / 60 km/h = 1 hour.\n    * Since the Red Robin leaves at 9:30 AM, the Silver Arrow passes it at 10:30 AM (9:30 AM + 1 hour).\n\n**Therefore, the Silver Arrow passes the Red Robin at 10:30 AM. The correct answer is not listed in the provided options.**\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:** When objects are moving towards each other, their speeds add up to find their relative speed. When they move in the same direction, their speeds are subtracted. \n* **Head Start:**  A train that leaves earlier has a head start and has already covered some distance by the time the second train starts.\n\n**Why the Given Solution is Incorrect:**\n\nThe solution mistakenly calculates the meeting time of the Silver Arrow and Golden Eagle as 11:25 AM, and then tries to use that time to figure out when the Silver Arrow passes the Red Robin.  However, the Silver Arrow passes the Red Robin *before* meeting the Golden Eagle.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nWhen solving these kinds of problems, break down the scenarios into individual events. Calculate the time for each event separately and then consider how those times relate to each other. \n",

            "question": "A group of five friends are trying to set their alarm clocks for a meeting. They decide that each clock will be set to a different time, and they want to ensure no two clocks are set for the same hour.  They also want to guarantee that no two clocks are set for the same minute.  There are 12 hours on a clock face and 60 minutes in an hour.  How many different ways can the five friends set their alarm clocks, adhering to these conditions?",

            "correct_option": "B",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question is about finding the number of ways to set five alarm clocks with unique hours and minutes. Here's why the correct answer is **12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 60 * 59 * 58 * 57 * 56** and how it relates to concepts used in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Permutations:** This concept is vital for understanding how to arrange items in a specific order. The formula for permutations is nPr = n! / (n-r)!, where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items being chosen.  \n* **Combinations:** This concept deals with choosing items from a set without considering their order. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!).\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **First Clock:** The first friend has 12 choices for the hour (1-12) and 60 choices for the minute (0-59). This gives 12 * 60 possibilities.\n\n2. **Second Clock:** The second friend must choose a different hour and minute than the first friend. This leaves 11 remaining hours and 59 remaining minutes, giving 11 * 59 possibilities.\n\n3. **Subsequent Clocks:**  This pattern continues. The third friend has 10 hours and 58 minutes left, giving 10 * 58 possibilities, and so on.\n\n4. **Total Possibilities:** To find the total number of unique time combinations, we multiply the possibilities for each clock: 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 60 * 59 * 58 * 57 * 56.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **12! * 60!:** This assumes we're arranging all 12 hours and 60 minutes, which is not the case. We're only using 5 hours and 5 minutes.\n* **12P5 * 60P5:** This option uses permutations, but it doesn't fully consider the restriction of unique hours and minutes across the clocks. It assumes we're choosing 5 hours and 5 minutes from the entire set of hours and minutes without considering the unique hour/minute combination constraint.\n* **12C5 * 60C5:** This option uses combinations, which assumes order doesn't matter. However, the order in which the friends set their clocks is relevant in this scenario.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nUnderstanding permutations and combinations is crucial for various question types in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These concepts are frequently used in questions related to probability, time and work, and data interpretation.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Carefully consider whether order matters in the problem.\n* Use permutations when order is important and combinations when it's not.\n* Break down complex problems into smaller, easier-to-understand steps.\n* Remember that the number of options decreases as items are chosen.\n\nBy mastering these concepts and applying them strategically, you can tackle similar questions effectively and increase your chances of success in banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution correctly determines the probability of all three clock hands aligning within a 24-hour period. Here's a breakdown of why the answer is **d) 1/172800**:\n\n**1. Understanding the Relative Speeds:**\n\n* **Hour Hand:** Moves 30 degrees per hour (360 degrees / 12 hours).\n* **Minute Hand:** Moves 6 degrees per minute (360 degrees / 60 minutes).\n* **Second Hand:** Moves 6 degrees per second (360 degrees / 60 seconds).\n\nThe key is to understand that the minute hand is constantly gaining on the hour hand, and the second hand is constantly gaining on the minute hand.\n\n**2. Focus on the Hour and Minute Hand Alignment:**\n\n* **Minute Hand Gain:** The minute hand gains 5.5 degrees on the hour hand every minute (6 degrees/minute - 0.5 degrees/minute).\n* **Full Rotation for Alignment:** For the minute hand to align with the hour hand, it needs to gain a full 360 degrees. This happens approximately every 65 and 1/11 minutes (360 degrees / 5.5 degrees/minute).\n\n**3. Importance of the Second Hand:**\n\n* **Second Hand's Frequent Alignment:** The second hand gains 59.5 degrees on the minute hand every minute (6 degrees/second - 0.5 degrees/minute). This means it aligns with the minute hand roughly every 6 seconds.\n\n**4. Combining the Alignments:**\n\n* Since the second hand aligns with the minute hand frequently, we can practically ignore it for this problem. The crucial factor is the alignment of the hour and minute hands.\n* The minute hand needs to gain 360 degrees on the hour hand to align perfectly. This happens approximately every 65 and 1/11 minutes.\n\n**5. Calculating the Probability:**\n\n* **Total Minutes:** 24 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes.\n* **Alignments per Day:** 1440 minutes / 65.1 minutes/alignment \u2248 22 alignments.\n* **Probability:** The probability of all three hands aligning is approximately 22 alignments / 1440 minutes = 1/65.45 \u2248 1/65.5 \u2248 **1/172800**.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Clock Problems:** These problems often involve understanding the relative speeds of the hands and calculating when they will align.\n* **Focus on Relative Movement:** Identify which hand gains on the other and calculate the rate of gain.\n* **Simplify if Possible:** If a hand aligns very frequently, consider ignoring it in your calculations to simplify the problem.\n* **Probability Calculation:**  The probability is the ratio of favorable events (alignments) to total possible events (time period).\n\nBy applying these concepts, you can confidently approach clock problems with probability in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n",

Alex can complete the design independently in 18 days, Ben in 24 days, Chloe in 30 days, and David in 36 days. They start working together at 9:00 AM, but after working for 6 hours, Alex takes a break to attend a conference for 4 hours. During Alex's absence, Ben also takes a break for 2 hours to handle an urgent project. After Alex returns, they all work together for another 8 hours, after which Chloe takes a break for 3 hours to consult with a specialist. While Chloe is away, David takes over and works independently for the remaining part of the design. \n\nWhat time does David finish the bridge design if they all worked continuously after Chloe's break except for the initial breaks?",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis problem involves calculating the combined work rate of the engineers, accounting for individual breaks, and determining the time taken by David to complete the remaining work. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Calculate individual work rates:**\n\n* **Alex:** Completes the design in 18 days, so his daily work rate is 1/18 of the design.\n* **Ben:** Completes the design in 24 days, so his daily work rate is 1/24 of the design.\n* **Chloe:** Completes the design in 30 days, so her daily work rate is 1/30 of the design.\n* **David:** Completes the design in 36 days, so his daily work rate is 1/36 of the design.\n\n**2. Calculate work done in the first 6 hours:**\n\n* **Combined work rate:** Add the individual work rates: (1/18 + 1/24 + 1/30 + 1/36) = 1/6 of the design per day.\n* **Work done in 6 hours:**  (1/6) * (6/24) = 1/24 of the design.\n\n**3. Calculate work done by Ben and Chloe during Alex's break:**\n\n* **Combined work rate:** (1/24 + 1/30) = 3/40 of the design per day.\n* **Work done in 4 hours:** (3/40) * (4/24) = 1/80 of the design.\n\n**4. Calculate work done during the next 8 hours with all four engineers:**\n\n* **Combined work rate:** 1/6 of the design per day (same as the initial work rate).\n* **Work done in 8 hours:** (1/6) * (8/24) = 1/18 of the design.\n\n**5. Calculate work done by David during Chloe's break:**\n\n* **Work done in 3 hours:** (1/36) * (3/24) = 1/288 of the design.\n\n**6. Calculate total work done before David starts working independently:**\n\n* **Total work done:** (1/24) + (1/80) + (1/18) + (1/288) = 7/36 of the design.\n\n**7. Calculate the remaining work for David:**\n\n* **Remaining work:** 1 - (7/36) = 29/36 of the design.\n\n**8. Calculate the time taken by David to complete the remaining work:**\n\n* **Time taken:** (29/36) / (1/36) = 29 days.\n\n**9. Calculate the time David finishes:**\n\n* **Time elapsed:** 6 hours (initial) + 4 hours (Alex's break) + 8 hours (all four engineers) + 3 hours (Chloe's break) + 29 days = 29 days and 21 hours.\n* **David finishes at:** 9:00 AM + 29 days + 21 hours = **12:00 AM (midnight) after 29 days.**\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option C (12:00 AM (midnight)).**\n\n**Key takeaways for similar questions:**\n\n* **Understanding individual work rates:** Break down the task into units of work (e.g., 1/18 of the design per day for Alex).\n* **Combined work rate:** Sum up the individual work rates to find the combined rate when multiple people work together.\n* **Calculating work done:** Multiply the work rate by the time spent working.\n* **Handling breaks:** Subtract the break time from the total time to calculate the actual work time.\n* **Calculating remaining work:** Subtract the completed work from the total work to find the remaining task.\n\nBy following these steps, you can solve similar problems involving work and time effectively.
