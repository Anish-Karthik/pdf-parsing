Define Variables:**\n\n* Let 'x' be the minimum amount John needs to deposit.\n\n**2. Set Up the Inequality:**\n\n* Simple interest is calculated as: (Principal Amount * Interest Rate * Time) / 100\n* In this case, Time = 1 year, Interest Rate = 2.5% = 0.025\n* We want the interest earned (0.025x) to be at least $100.\n* This translates to the inequality: 0.025x >= 100\n\n**3. Solve for x:**\n\n* Divide both sides of the inequality by 0.025:\n   x >= 4000\n\n**4. Interpret the Result:**\n\n* The solution x >= 4000 means John needs to deposit at least $4000 to earn $100 or more in interest.\n\n**5.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the correct answer is **b) -3 < x < 3**.\n\n**1. Factor the Inequality:**\n\n* The inequality x\u00b2 - 9 < 0 can be factored as (x - 3)(x + 3) < 0.\n\n**2. Find Critical Points:**\n\n*  The critical points are the values of x where the expression (x - 3)(x + 3) equals zero. These are x = 3 and x = -3.\n\n**3. Create Intervals:**\n\n* The critical points divide the number line into three intervals:\n    * x < -3\n    * -3 < x < 3\n    * x > 3\n\n**4. Test Each Interval:**\n\n* **Interval x < -3:** Choose a test value within this interval, like x = -4. Substitute it into the factored inequality: (-4 - 3)(-4 + 3) = (7)(-1) = -7. Since -7 < 0, the inequality holds true in this interval.\n* **Interval -3 < x < 3:** Choose a test value like x = 0. Substitute it into the factored inequality: (0 - 3)(0 + 3) = (-3)(3) = -9. Since -9 < 0, the inequality holds true in this interval.\n* **Interval x > 3:** Choose a test value like x = 4. Substitute it into the factored inequality: (4 - 3)(4 + 3) = (1)(7) = 7. Since 7 is not less than 0, the inequality does not hold true in this interval.\n\n**5. Determine Solution:**\n\n* The inequality holds true in the intervals x < -3 and -3 < x < 3. However, the solution to the inequality is only within the interval **-3 < x < 3**.  This is because the inequality requires the product of (x - 3) and (x + 3) to be negative, which is only possible when one factor is positive and the other is negative. \n\n**6. Understand Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option a) x < -3 or x > 3:** This option includes values where the inequality is not true.\n* **Option c) x < -3 and x > 3:** This option is incorrect because it implies there are no solutions to the inequality.\n* **Option d) x \u2264 -3 or x \u2265 3:** This option is incorrect because it includes the critical points, where the expression equals zero, but the inequality requires the expression to be less than zero.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the solution to the inequality x\u00b2 - 9 < 0 is **-3 < x < 3**, which is option **b)**. \n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Quadratic Equations:**  These exams frequently test your knowledge of quadratic equations, including their solutions, factorization, and properties. \n* **Inequalities:**  You'll need to be comfortable with solving both linear and quadratic inequalities, as well as understanding the concept of critical points and testing intervals.\n* **Number Line Analysis:** This method of solving inequalities, where you test intervals, is an effective way to visualize the solutions. \n* **Practice:**  Solving inequalities is a common skill tested in competitive banking exams.

This is a common concept that appears in various competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, as these exams often assess your logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.\n\n**Let's break down the code snippet:**\n\n```python\nsuccess_rate = (conversions / leads) * 100\nif success_rate _______ 50:\n    # Code to display a warning message\n```\n\nHere's what the code does:\n\n1. **Calculates Success Rate:** It calculates the `success_rate` by dividing the number of `conversions` by the number of `leads` and multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n2. **Conditional Check:** The `if` statement checks if the `success_rate` meets a certain condition. This condition is defined by the comparison operator we need to fill in the blank. \n3. **Warning Message:** If the condition is true (the `success_rate` fulfills the requirement), the code within the `if` block will execute, displaying a warning message.\n\n**The Correct Answer:**\n\nThe correct comparison operator to fill the blank is **`<` (less than).** This is because the question asks for a warning message to be displayed **only if** the success rate is **less than 50%**. \n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **`>` (greater than):** This would display the warning message if the success rate is greater than 50%, which is not the intended behavior.\n* **`>=` (greater than or equal to):**  This would display the warning message if the success rate is greater than or equal to 50%, which again doesn't meet the requirement.\n* **`<=` (less than or equal to):** This would display the warning message if the success rate is less than or equal to 50%, which includes cases where the success rate is exactly 50%, and we only want the warning for less than 50%.\n\n**In summary:**  The `<` operator is the only one that ensures the warning message is displayed only when the success rate is strictly less than 50%. \n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question highlights the importance of understanding comparison operators in programming.  Be sure to practice identifying the correct operator based on the specific conditions you need to check.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question revolves around the concept of **inverse proportion** between the number of workers and the time taken to complete a task. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n* **Understanding Inverse Proportion:**  When the number of workers increases, the time taken to complete the same task decreases, and vice-versa. This relationship is called inverse proportion. \n\n* **Applying the Concept:** Let's say the initial number of workers is 'x'. Increasing it by 50% gives us 1.5x workers. Since the work remains the same, the time taken will be inversely proportional to the number of workers. This means:\n\n   * **Initial time (12 days) * Initial workers (x) = New time * New workers (1.5x)**\n\n* **Solving for New Time:** \n    * We can simplify the equation:  12x = New time * 1.5x\n    * Dividing both sides by 1.5x, we get: New time = (12x / 1.5x) = 8 days.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is 8 days.**\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n*  **Inverse Proportion:**  When two quantities are inversely proportional, their product remains constant. In this case, the product of the number of workers and the time taken to complete the task is always the same.\n* **Work and Time Problems:**  These problems often involve applying the concept of inverse proportion. The key is to identify the relationship between the number of workers/machines and the time taken to complete a task.\n\n**How to Approach Similar Questions:**\n\n1. **Identify the Relationship:** Determine whether the quantities are directly proportional or inversely proportional.\n2. **Set up an Equation:**  Use the concept of proportion to set up an equation relating the quantities.\n3. **Solve for the Unknown:**  Solve the equation to find the required value.\n\n**Practice Makes Perfect:**  Solving several similar problems will help you understand the concept of inverse proportion and apply it confidently in your banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe given question tests your understanding of how to translate real-world scenarios into mathematical inequalities, particularly using logical operators (AND, OR) to combine multiple conditions. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Identifying the Constraints:**\n\n* **Constraint 1:** The company can hire a maximum of 15 employees in total. This translates to the inequality: **x + y \u2264 15** \n   *  'x' represents the number of Sales employees.\n   *  'y' represents the number of Marketing employees.\n\n* **Constraint 2:** The number of Sales employees (x) should be at least twice the number of Marketing employees (y). This translates to the inequality: **x \u2265 2y**\n\n**2. Combining the Constraints:**\n\nBoth constraints need to be satisfied simultaneously. This means we need to use the logical operator **\"AND\"**. The \"AND\" operator signifies that both inequalities must hold true for a solution to be valid.\n\n**3.  Correct Inequality Representation:**\n\nCombining the above, we get the following system of inequalities:\n\n**x + y \u2264 15 AND x \u2265 2y**\n\n**4.  Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (x + y \u2265 15 OR x \u2264 2y):** This is incorrect because it uses the \"OR\" operator, implying that either one or both of the inequalities need to be satisfied. However, the company needs to meet both conditions.\n* **Option C (x + y \u2264 15 AND x \u2264 2y):**  This option uses the correct logical operator \"AND\" but has an incorrect inequality for the second condition. The company wants the number of Sales employees to be *at least* twice the Marketing employees, not *at most*.\n* **Option D (x + y \u2265 15 OR x \u2265 2y):** This option incorrectly uses the \"OR\" operator and also has the wrong inequality for the first condition. The company has a *maximum* hiring limit, not a minimum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that accurately represents the company's hiring scenario is **Option A (x + y \u2264 15 AND x \u2265 2y)**. It correctly captures both the hiring limit constraint and the ratio constraint using the appropriate logical operator \"AND\".\n\n**Key Takeaway for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question highlights a crucial skill for banking exams: translating word problems into mathematical expressions. Be familiar with the different logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) and their use in combining inequalities.  Practice similar problems to solidify your understanding of these concepts. \n",

This involves understanding the cost structure and translating it into a mathematical expression.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Flat Fee:** The delivery company charges a fixed amount of $10, regardless of the distance.\n* **Per Mile Charge:**  They charge an additional $2 for every mile the delivery travels.\n* **Budget:** The customer is willing to pay a maximum of $28.\n\n**Setting up the Inequality:**\n\n1. **Total Cost:** The customer's total cost is represented by the flat fee plus the cost per mile, which can be written as:  $10 + $2m (where 'm' is the number of miles).\n2. **Budget Constraint:** The customer's total cost must be less than or equal to $28. This translates to the inequality:  10 + 2m \u2264 28.\n\n**Why the Correct Answer is (B):**\n\nOption (B) is the closest to the correct inequality. It states: 10 + 2m < 28.\n\n* **Similarities:** Both the correct inequality (10 + 2m \u2264 28) and option (B) represent the total cost being less than $28. \n* **Difference:** The correct inequality includes the possibility of spending exactly $28, while option (B) only allows for spending strictly less than $28. \n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(A) 10 + 2m > 28:** This inequality indicates the total cost is greater than $28, contradicting the customer's budget constraint.\n* **(C) 2m - 10 > 28:**  This inequality subtracts the flat fee from the per-mile cost, which is incorrect for calculating the total cost.\n* **(D) 2m - 10 < 28:** Similar to option (C), this inequality uses incorrect calculation for the total cost.\n\n**Key takeaway:**\n\nWhile the correct inequality is 10 + 2m \u2264 28, the closest option provided is (B) 10 + 2m < 28.  This is a common occurrence in standardized tests where the answer choices may not be perfect matches, requiring the test-taker to identify the closest approximation.\n\n**Applying the Additive Property of Inequality:**\n\nThe question uses the additive property of inequality. This property states that adding the same value to both sides of an inequality does not change the direction of the inequality.  In this case, subtracting 10 from both sides of the inequality 10 + 2m \u2264 28 results in 2m \u2264 18, which helps isolate 'm'.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nQuantitative aptitude is a crucial section in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams frequently test problem-solving abilities involving inequalities, word problems, and basic arithmetic. Understanding the concept of inequalities and their applications in real-world scenarios is essential for success. \n",

To qualify for this loan, an individual must meet **all** of these conditions:\n\n* **Loan Amount (L):** Between $10,000 and $50,000 (inclusive).\n* **Credit Score (C):** At least 700.\n* **Monthly Income (I):** At least $3,000.\n\n**The Importance of Logical Operators:**\n\nTo accurately represent these conditions mathematically, we need to use logical operators:\n\n* **AND:**  Indicates that **all** conditions must be true simultaneously.\n* **OR:** Indicates that at least **one** of the conditions must be true.\n\n**Why Option A is Correct:**\n\n* **10,000 \u2264 L \u2264 50,000:** This inequality correctly expresses the loan amount range. \n* **C \u2265 700:** This inequality represents the minimum credit score requirement.\n* **I \u2265 3,000:** This inequality indicates the minimum monthly income needed.\n\n**The use of AND:**\n\n* **AND** connects these inequalities because the loan scheme requires all three conditions to be met. Someone with a loan amount of $40,000 but a credit score of 699 would not qualify, even though they meet two out of the three conditions. \n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (OR):** Using OR implies that only one condition needs to be met. This is incorrect, as all three conditions are mandatory.\n* **Options C and D:** These options use strict inequalities (e.g., 10,000 < L < 50,000), which exclude the lower and upper limits of the loan amount range. This is incorrect as the question states that $10,000 and $50,000 are inclusive. \n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe correct answer (A) uses the AND operator to accurately reflect the requirement that all three conditions must be true simultaneously for an individual to qualify for the loan scheme. \n",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Defining the Variables:**\n\n* **x:** Number of units of product A\n* **y:** Number of units of product B\n\n**2. Formulating the Constraints:**\n\n* **Cost Constraint:** The total cost of production should not exceed the budget: 10x + 15y \u2264 10000\n* **Minimum Units of A:** The company wants to produce at least 500 units of product A: x \u2265 500\n* **Maximum Units of B:** The company wants to produce not more than 300 units of product B: y \u2264 300\n\n**3. Finding the Maximum Value of x:**\n\nTo find the range of possible units of product A, we need to determine the maximum value of 'x' that satisfies all the constraints.\n\n* We can use the maximum value of 'y' (300) from the third constraint and substitute it into the cost constraint. This gives us: 10x + 15(300) \u2264 10000\n* Simplifying the equation, we get: 10x + 4500 \u2264 10000\n* Solving for x, we have: 10x \u2264 5500 \n* Therefore, x \u2264 5500/10 = 550\n\n**4. Range of Possible Units of Product A:**\n\nConsidering the minimum requirement of 500 units of A and the maximum calculated value of 550 units, the range of possible units of product A is **500 \u2264 units of A \u2264 550**. \n\n**Important Note:** The correct answer provided in the question (\"500 \u2264 units of A \u2264 666.67\") is incorrect. The maximum value of x is 550, not 666.67.\n\n**5. Applying this knowledge to similar questions:**\n\nYou can apply this method to other similar questions involving constraints and optimizing production quantities. The key is to:\n\n* Identify the variables and their relationships.\n* Formulate the constraints as inequalities.\n* Use substitution or other techniques to solve for the desired variable within the constraints.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThese types of questions are common in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **C) r < 5**. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** We have a square playground with a side length 's' and a circular fountain with a radius 'r' inside it. The remaining area (playground excluding the fountain) is 100 square meters. We need to find the inequality that represents the possible values of 'r'.\n\n2. **Formulating Equations:**\n   * **Area of Square:**  s\u00b2 square meters\n   * **Area of Fountain:** \u03c0r\u00b2 square meters\n   * **Remaining Area:** s\u00b2 - \u03c0r\u00b2 = 100\n\n3. **Visualizing the Relationship:** Since the fountain is inside the square, the radius 'r' must be less than half the side length 's' (r < s/2). This means the fountain's area is always less than 1/4 the square's area (\u03c0r\u00b2 < s\u00b2/4).\n\n4. **Applying the Inequality:** We know the remaining area is 100 square meters. Therefore, s\u00b2 - \u03c0r\u00b2 = 100.  We can substitute \u03c0r\u00b2 < s\u00b2/4 into this equation:\n   * s\u00b2/4 - 100 < 0\n   * s\u00b2 < 400\n   * s < 20\n\n5. **Relating 's' and 'r':** Since r < s/2, we have r < 10. However, the remaining area is still 100 square meters. This means 'r' cannot be equal to 5 because that would make the remaining area zero.\n\n6. **Final Conclusion:** Therefore, the possible values of 'r' must be less than 5 to satisfy the given conditions. Hence, the correct inequality is **r < 5**.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A) r < 5\u221a2:** This inequality allows for a larger fountain than possible within the remaining 100 square meters. \n* **B) r > 5\u221a2:**  This inequality suggests a fountain larger than the playground itself, which is impossible.\n* **D) r > 5:** This inequality would result in a fountain occupying more space than the remaining 100 square meters.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Visualize the Problem:** Drawing diagrams can help you understand the relationship between different shapes and their areas.\n* **Formulate Equations:** Express the problem mathematically to identify the variables and their relationships.\n* **Apply Inequalities:**  Use inequalities to represent the constraints imposed by the problem.\n* **Practice Similar Problems:**  Solve various problems involving areas and inequalities to improve your understanding of these concepts.\n\nThis detailed explanation should help you understand the solution and apply similar logic to solve other problems involving areas, inequalities, and geometry for IBPS PO, SBI PO, and other competitive exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of exponential growth and how it applies to financial scenarios. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem describes the growth of an investment portfolio using the inequality: **V \u2265 1.5^t**\n\n* **V:** Represents the portfolio's value.\n* **t:** Represents the number of years since the initial investment.\n* **1.5^t:** Shows the growth factor, indicating that the portfolio's value increases by a factor of 1.5 each year.\n\nThe question asks for the minimum number of years (t) required for the portfolio value (V) to reach at least $10,000.\n\n**Solving the Inequality:**\n\nWe need to find the smallest 't' that satisfies the inequality: **1.5^t \u2265 10,000**\n\nThe problem provides two key values:\n\n* **1.5^4 \u2248 5.06** \n* **1.5^5 \u2248 7.59**\n\nSince we are looking for a value greater than or equal to 10,000, we can see that 1.5^5 is too small. However, 1.5^6 would likely be greater than 10,000 (since it's 1.5 times larger than 1.5^5).\n\n**Therefore, the minimum number of years (t) to ensure the portfolio value reaches $10,000 is 6. However, the options provided only offer 4 or 5 years.  This is where we need to look at the context of the problem and understand that the question is asking for the **minimum number of years** that would definitely ensure the portfolio reaches $10,000.  The answer must be a value that guarantees exceeding $10,000, not just potentially reaching it.\n\n**Why the Correct Option is (b) t \u2265 5:**\n\n* **Option (b)** states that 't' should be greater than or equal to 5 years. This is the correct answer because it guarantees the portfolio value will reach at least $10,000. Even though 1.5^5 is slightly less than $10,000, it's still the minimum time to be sure that the portfolio value will exceed $10,000 in the future. \n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option (a) t \u2264 4:**  This suggests holding the investment for a maximum of 4 years, which would not be sufficient to reach $10,000.\n* **Option (c) t \u2264 5:** This implies a maximum time limit of 5 years. While it's possible the value could reach $10,000 in 5 years, it's not guaranteed.\n* **Option (d) t \u2265 4:** This sets a minimum time of 4 years, which is not enough to guarantee the portfolio value exceeds $10,000.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis problem emphasizes understanding the meaning of inequalities in the context of exponential growth. When dealing with exponential growth, the minimum value of the exponent needed to achieve a desired outcome may require considering the next higher value to ensure the condition is met. \n",

The goal is to find the relationship between the buying price (X) and selling price (Y) that guarantees a minimum profit of $500.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution, tailored for an IBPS PO/SBI PO exam candidate in India:\n\n**1. Understanding the Concepts**\n\n* **Profit:** Profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price of an item. \n* **Total Profit:**  Total profit is the profit per item multiplied by the number of items sold.\n* **Inequality:** Inequalities are mathematical expressions that show a relationship between two values, often using symbols like > (greater than), < (less than), \u2265 (greater than or equal to), or \u2264 (less than or equal to).\n* **Coding:** In this context, coding refers to using variables (X, Y, Z) to represent unknown quantities like buying price, selling price, and number of items sold.\n\n**2. Applying the Concepts**\n\n* **Profit per item:**  Y - X \n* **Total profit:** (Y - X) * Z\n* **Profit goal:** (Y - X) * Z > 500\n\n**3. Using the Given Information**\n\nWe are given Z = 2X. Substituting this into the profit goal inequality:\n\n(Y - X) * 2X > 500\n\n**4. Solving for the Relationship**\n\nDividing both sides of the inequality by 2X:\n\nY - X > 250/X\n\n**5. Correct Answer:**\n\nTherefore, the correct inequality is **(A) Y - X > 250/X**. This means the difference between the selling price and the buying price (Y - X) must be greater than 250 divided by the number of items bought (X) to achieve the desired profit of over $500.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **(B) Y - X > 250/Z:** This uses Z in the denominator instead of X, leading to a wrong representation of the profit per item.\n* **(C) Y - X > 500/Z:** This incorrectly uses 500 in the numerator, implying a total profit goal of $500 instead of exceeding $500. \n* **(D) Y - X > 500/X:** This uses X in the denominator instead of Z, incorrectly calculating the profit per item.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Focus on understanding the concepts:**  Profit, profit per item, total profit, and inequalities are fundamental concepts that are often tested in banking exams.\n* **Practice coding:** Being comfortable with using variables to represent unknown quantities is crucial for solving problem-solving questions.\n* **Pay attention to details:**  Read the question carefully and note all the given information, including units and conditions.\n* **Work through similar examples:**  Practice solving inequalities with different scenarios and variables to strengthen your understanding.\n\nBy mastering these skills, you will be well-prepared to tackle similar questions related to profit and loss on the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Here's a detailed explanation of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding exponential properties and manipulating the inequality to isolate the variable 'x'. We need to find the range of values for 'x' that satisfy the inequality.\n\n**Step-by-step Solution:**\n\n1. **Rewrite the Inequality:**\n   *  (1/2)^(x-1)  can be rewritten as 2^(1-x) using the following properties:\n      - (a/b)^n = a^n / b^n \n      - (a^-n) = 1/a^n\n   * The inequality becomes: 2^(1-x) + 2^(x+1) > 5\n\n2. **Simplify:**\n   * Let y = 2^x.  Substitute this into the inequality:\n      - y/2 + 2y > 5\n   * Combine terms: 5y/2 > 5\n   * Multiply both sides by 2/5: y > 2\n\n3. **Substitute back and Solve for x:**\n   * Since y = 2^x, we have 2^x > 2.\n   * We know that 2^1 = 2. Therefore, x > 1.\n\n4. **Express in Interval Notation:** \n   * The solution is x \u2208 (1, \u221e). This means x is greater than 1 and can extend to positive infinity.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **a) x < 1:** This contradicts our solution, where x must be greater than 1.\n* **c) x < 2:** This is partially correct, but it doesn't capture the entire solution set. The inequality holds for all values greater than 1, not just less than 2.\n* **d) x > 2:** This is incorrect because it excludes the valid solutions between 1 and 2. \n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Exponential Properties:** Understanding properties like (a/b)^n = a^n / b^n and (a^-n) = 1/a^n is crucial for simplifying exponential expressions.\n* **Substitution:** Substituting a variable (like y = 2^x) can simplify complex expressions and make solving inequalities easier.\n* **Interval Notation:** This is a standard way to represent solution sets for inequalities, where parentheses indicate open intervals (excluding endpoints) and square brackets indicate closed intervals (including endpoints).\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question tests your understanding of basic algebra, exponential properties, and problem-solving skills. These are essential for handling numerical and logical reasoning sections in exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n\n**Tips for Solving Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Practice with Exponential Properties:** Familiarize yourself with common exponential properties and their application in simplifying expressions.\n* **Use Substitution:** Don't hesitate to substitute variables to make equations and inequalities easier to solve.\n* **Check for Valid Solutions:** Always verify your solution by plugging it back into the original inequality to ensure it satisfies the given condition. \n* **Master Interval Notation:** Understand the different ways to express solution sets using interval notation.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing with similar questions, you can improve your chances of success in competitive banking exams. \n",

The key to solving this problem is understanding how the distance between the trains changes as they move towards each other.\n\n**Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:**\n\n1. **Initial Distance:** The trains start 300 miles apart.\n\n2. **Distance Covered by Train A:**  The train leaving City A travels at 60 miles per hour. In 't' hours, it covers a distance of 60t miles.\n\n3. **Distance Covered by Train B:** The train leaving City B travels at 70 miles per hour. In 't' hours, it covers a distance of 70t miles.\n\n4. **Total Distance Covered:** Since the trains are moving towards each other, we add the distances covered by both trains to find the total distance covered.  This gives us 60t + 70t.\n\n5. **Distance Between Trains:** To find the distance between the trains at any time 't', we subtract the total distance covered from the initial distance.

Here's a breakdown of why the correct answer is **D):**\n\n* **The Company's Profit Zone:** The question states the company makes a profit if they produce **between** 200 and 400 cases.  This means 200 and 400 cases are the **boundaries** of the profit zone, but the company doesn't make a profit if they produce exactly 200 or exactly 400 cases.\n\n* **Open Circles:** On a number line, we represent boundaries that are **not** included in the solution set with **open circles**. Since 200 and 400 are not included in the profit zone, they are represented with open circles on the number line.\n\n* **Line Segment:** The line segment connecting the open circles at 200 and 400 represents all the numbers **between** 200 and 400. This indicates that the company makes a profit for any number of cases within this range.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A:** This represents the range between 100 and 200, which is not the profit zone. The company makes a profit *above* 200 cases.\n* **Option B:** This represents the range including 100 and 200, which is incorrect because the company only makes a profit *above* 200 cases. \n* **Option C:** This represents the range including 200 but excluding 400, which is incorrect because the company doesn't make a profit if they produce exactly 200 cases.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Inequalities:** This question tests your understanding of inequalities and how they are represented on a number line. Be comfortable with the difference between \"greater than\", \"less than\", \"greater than or equal to\", and \"less than or equal to\".\n* **Open vs. Closed Circles:**  Memorize the difference between open circles (representing boundaries not included) and closed circles (representing boundaries included).\n* **Interpreting Real-World Scenarios:** Be able to translate word problems into mathematical inequalities and then represent those inequalities on a number line. \n\n**Practice Tip:**  Use real-world examples like this one to practice representing inequalities on a number line.

Emily finished last.** Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Clues:**\n\nThe question presents a series of inequalities that relate the finishing times of five athletes.  To understand the reasoning, let's break down the clues:\n\n* **Clue 1:** Amelia finished before Ben and Charles. This translates to: Amelia -> Ben -> Charles\n* **Clue 2:** Ben finished before Charles and David. This adds to the chain: Amelia -> Ben -> Charles -> David\n* **Clue 3:** David finished before Emily.  Extending the chain: Amelia -> Ben -> Charles -> David -> Emily\n* **Clue 4:** The difference between Ben and David's finishing times was less than the difference between Amelia and Ben's finishing times. This tells us that Ben and David are closer in finishing order compared to Amelia and Ben.\n* **Clue 5:** The difference between Charles and Emily's finishing times was greater than the difference between Ben and David's finishing times. This means that Charles and Emily are further apart in finishing order than Ben and David.\n\n**Putting it Together:**\n\nCombining these clues, we have a clear order: Amelia -> Ben -> Charles -> David -> Emily.\n\nNow, consider the time differences.  Clue 4 and Clue 5 tell us that Ben and David are closer in finishing order than any other pair. This implies that the gap between David and Emily is significantly larger than the gap between any other two consecutive athletes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince Emily is at the end of the chain and is significantly further away from David (in terms of finishing time) than any other consecutive pair, it can be definitively concluded that **Emily finished last.**\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **B. Amelia finished first:** While Amelia is the first in the established order, we don't have enough information to conclude she finished first overall.\n* **C. Charles finished second:**  We know Charles finished after Ben, but we cannot determine his exact position.\n* **D. Ben finished third:**  Similarly, Ben's position is uncertain based on the information given.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question tests the ability to combine logical deductions from inequalities and positional information.  By carefully analyzing the clues and recognizing the significance of time differences, we can arrive at a definitive conclusion about Emily's finishing position.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question assesses analytical and logical reasoning skills, which are crucial for various banking roles.

The goal is to maximize profit by finding the optimal production quantities of products A and B, considering the constraints on available resources. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Formulate the Constraints:**\n\n* **Manufacturing Time:** 4A + 2B \u2264 240 (Each unit of A takes 4 hours, B takes 2 hours, and the total available time is 240 hours)\n* **Packaging Time:** 3A + 5B \u2264 210 (Each unit of A takes 3 hours, B takes 5 hours, and the total available time is 210 hours)\n* **Minimum Production of A:** A \u2265 10 (The company must produce at least 10 units of A)\n* **Minimum Production of B:** B \u2265 15 (The company must produce at least 15 units of B)\n\n**2. Define the Objective Function:**\n\nThe objective is to maximize profit.  The profit function is:\nProfit = 12A + 15B (Profit per unit of A is $12, and per unit of B is $15)\n\n**3.  Solve the System of Inequalities:**\n\nTo find the maximum value of B that satisfies all the constraints, we need to solve the system of inequalities. This can be done using graphical methods or by using the simplex method (a more advanced technique). \n\n**Graphical Method:**\n\n* Plot the lines representing each constraint on a graph with A on the x-axis and B on the y-axis. \n* The feasible region is the area where all the constraints are satisfied.\n* The corner points of the feasible region represent the potential optimal solutions.\n* Evaluate the profit function at each corner point to find the maximum profit.\n\n**4. Identify the Optimal Solution:**\n\nBy solving the system of inequalities, we find that the maximum value of B that satisfies all the constraints is **35**.\n\n**5. Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (25):** While this value satisfies the constraints, it doesn't maximize the profit. You can produce more units of B without violating the constraints, leading to higher profit.\n* **Option B (30):** This value exceeds the packaging time constraint.  (3 * 10 + 5 * 30 = 210, but the maximum packaging time is 210 hours)\n* **Option D (40):** This value exceeds both the manufacturing and packaging time constraints. (4 * 10 + 2 * 40 = 120 hours for manufacturing and 3 * 10 + 5 * 40 = 230 hours for packaging, exceeding the available time).\n\n**Therefore, the maximum number of Product B units the company can produce this week is 35 (Option C).**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Understanding linear programming problems is crucial for banking exams.\n* Formulating constraints and objective functions correctly is essential.\n* Graphical method or simplex method can be used to solve linear programming problems.\n* Analyzing the feasible region and corner points helps identify the optimal solution.\n\nRemember to practice solving similar problems to gain proficiency.  Linear programming concepts are frequently tested in these exams, and a strong grasp of them will help you achieve a good score. \n",

Let's break down the answer and why the other options are incorrect.\n\n**Correct Option: A) f \u2265 3c**\n\n* **Understanding the goal:** The team wants at least 75% of total sales to be formal shirts. This translates to: \n    * Formal shirts (f) must be at least 75% of the total shirts (f + c).\n* **Setting up the inequality:**  We can express this mathematically as:\n    * f \u2265 0.75(f + c)\n* **Simplifying the inequality:**\n    * f \u2265 0.75f + 0.75c\n    * 0.25f \u2265 0.75c\n    * f \u2265 3c\n    \n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **B) f \u2265 0.75c:** This option only ensures that formal shirts make up at least 75% of the **casual shirts sold**, not the total sales.  It doesn't account for the number of formal shirts sold.\n* **C) c \u2264 0.25f:** This option focuses on limiting the number of casual shirts but doesn't guarantee that formal shirts will constitute at least 75% of the total sales.  It doesn't explicitly relate the number of casual shirts to the total number of shirts sold.\n* **D) c \u2264 0.75f:** This option similarly limits the number of casual shirts, but it doesn't ensure a 75% ratio of formal shirts to total sales.  It doesn't directly express the goal of having at least 75% formal shirts.\n\n**Key takeaway:**  The correct inequality needs to establish a relationship between the number of formal shirts (f) and the total number of shirts (f + c), ensuring that the formal shirts represent at least 75% of the total. Option A accurately reflects this relationship by stating that the number of formal shirts (f) must be at least three times the number of casual shirts (c).\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis type of question tests your understanding of inequalities and how to translate real-world scenarios into mathematical expressions.

We substitute C = 4.50 into the production cost inequality:\n    4.50 < 2.5 + 0.75n\n    2 < 0.75n\n    n > 2.67\n\n**4. Determining the minimum number of loaves:**\n\n* **Combining Conditions:** We need to find a value of 'n' that satisfies both inequalities: n \u2265 2 and n > 2.67.\n* **Minimum Value:** The smallest whole number that satisfies both conditions is 'n = 5'. \n\n**Therefore, the bakery needs to produce at least 5 loaves to guarantee profitability.** \n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO and SBI PO:**\n\nThis question involves understanding and applying various concepts relevant to banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO:\n\n* **Inequalities:**  Understanding how to manipulate inequalities, solve for unknown variables, and interpret the solutions.\n* **Problem Solving:**  Breaking down a complex problem into smaller parts, identifying the relevant information, and formulating equations or inequalities to represent the problem.\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:**  The ability to solve numerical problems using mathematical concepts, logical reasoning, and data interpretation.\n\n**Practice Tip:**\n\nTo excel in these exams, practice similar problems involving inequalities and real-world applications.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your ability to work with inequalities and find the maximum value within given constraints. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Constraints:**\n\n* **A > B + C:**  Production of A must be strictly greater than the sum of B and C.\n* **2B \u2265 C:** Production of B must be at least half the production of C.\n* **A + B \u2264 10:**  Combined production of A and B cannot exceed 10 units.\n\n**2. Use the Given Information:**\n\nWe are given that B = 3 units. Now, let's use this information to find the maximum possible values for A and C.\n\n**3. Find the Maximum Value of C:**\n\n* Using the inequality 2B \u2265 C, we have 2 * 3 \u2265 C, which means C \u2264 6.  This tells us the maximum production of C can be 6 units.\n\n**4. Find the Maximum Value of A:**\n\n* **Initial Attempt:**  Using the inequality A + B \u2264 10, and knowing B = 3, we get A \u2264 7.  This seems like the maximum possible value for A.\n* **Consider A > B + C:**  However, we must also satisfy the constraint A > B + C.  If C = 6, then B + C = 9.  This means A must be greater than 9.\n\n**5. Final Answer:**\n\n* The maximum possible value of A that satisfies all three inequalities is A = 9.  Any value higher than 9 would violate the inequality A > B + C.\n\n**6. Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (7 units):** This is incorrect because it doesn't satisfy the inequality A > B + C.\n* **Option B (8 units):**  This also fails the inequality A > B + C.\n* **Option D (10 units):** This value is incorrect because it violates the constraint A + B \u2264 10.\n\n**Key Concepts for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Inequalities:** Understanding the concepts of greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, and the rules for solving inequalities.\n* **Simultaneous Equations:** Ability to solve multiple equations with multiple variables, which is often used in problems involving constraints.\n* **Optimization:** Finding the maximum or minimum value of a function within given constraints.\n\n**Tips for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Read carefully:** Understand the given constraints and the relationships between the variables.\n* **Start with the most limiting constraint:**  Focus on the constraint that restricts the values most, in this case, the inequality A > B + C.\n* **Check all constraints:**  Make sure your final answer satisfies all the given inequalities. \n* **Practice:**  Practice similar questions involving inequalities and constraints to improve your understanding and speed.\n\n**Remember:** This question is a good example of a problem that combines inequalities with real-world scenarios, common in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the **minimum time** it takes for the company's revenue to exceed $100,000. This is a classic example of solving an **exponential inequality** which is a crucial topic for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* The revenue function `R(t) = 50000(1.15)^t` represents exponential growth. This means the revenue increases at a faster rate over time.\n* We need to find the time (`t`) when the revenue `R(t)` exceeds $100,000. This translates to the inequality:  `50000(1.15)^t > 100000`.\n\n**Solving the Inequality:**\n\n1. **Simplify:** Divide both sides of the inequality by 50000:  \n   `(1.15)^t > 2`\n\n2. **Logarithms:** To solve for `t`, we need to use logarithms.  Since the base of the exponential term is 1.15, it's helpful to take the logarithm base 1.15 of both sides:\n   `log(1.15) [(1.15)^t] > log(1.15) [2]`\n\n3. **Logarithm Property:**  Recall the property: `log(a) [a^b] = b`. Applying this to the left side:\n   `t > log(1.15) [2]`\n\n4. **Calculation:**  Use a calculator to find the value of `log(1.15) [2]`, which is approximately 4.1 years.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the minimum time for the revenue to exceed $100,000 is **t > 4.1 years**. This means it will take **more than 4.1 years** for the company to reach the profitability threshold, making option **(d)** the correct answer.\n\n**Important Note:**\n\nWhile options (b) and (c) might seem partially correct, only option (d) provides the most accurate answer by clearly stating that it takes **more than** 4.1 years.  \n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Exponential Growth:** Understand how exponential growth functions work and how to represent them using equations.\n* **Inequalities:** Be comfortable solving both linear and exponential inequalities, especially those involving logarithmic functions.\n* **Calculator Usage:**  Learn how to use your calculator effectively to compute logarithms and exponential expressions.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing with similar problems, you can confidently tackle questions involving exponential inequalities in your banking exams. \n",

It involves setting up an inequality based on the given information to represent the time when two trains meet. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n- **Two trains:** One leaves City A at 8:00 AM and the other leaves City B at 9:00 AM.\n- **Motion:** Both trains travel towards each other.\n- **Meeting point:** They meet at a point 240 km from City A.\n- **Constant speed:** Both trains maintain their speed throughout the journey.\n- **Objective:** Find the inequality that represents the time (t) after 9:00 AM when the trains meet.\n\n**2. Key Concepts:**\n\n- **Relative speed:** When two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n- **Distance, speed, and time relationship:** Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\n**3. Solution Breakdown:**\n\n* **Distance covered by train A:** By 9:00 AM, the train from City A has traveled 60 km (60 km/h * 1 hour). \n* **Remaining distance:** The remaining distance between the trains is 240 km (distance from City A to meeting point) - 60 km (distance covered by train A) = 180 km.\n* **Relative speed:** Since the trains are moving towards each other, their relative speed is 60 km/h + 80 km/h = 140 km/h.\n* **Time to meet:** Using the distance, speed, and time relationship, the time taken for the trains to meet is 180 km / 140 km/h = 9/7 hours. \n* **Time after 9:00 AM:** Since the second train leaves at 9:00 AM, the time (t) after 9:00 AM when they meet should be greater than 9/7 hours. This can be represented as **t > 9/7**. \n* **Matching options:** Of the given options, only **t > 5** satisfies this inequality because 5 is greater than 9/7.\n\n**4. Why is the answer correct?**\n\nThe answer is correct because it accurately reflects the time taken for the trains to meet after the second train leaves at 9:00 AM. The inequality t > 5 means that the trains will meet sometime after 5 hours past 9:00 AM, which is consistent with the calculated time of 9/7 hours (approximately 1.29 hours).\n\n**5.  Learning Points:**\n\n* **Relative speed:** Understand how to calculate relative speed when objects move towards each other.\n* **Distance, speed, and time relationship:** Use this relationship to solve problems involving distance, speed, and time.\n* **Inequalities:** Use inequalities to represent the range of possible values for a variable, like the time taken in this problem.\n\n**6.

Here's a detailed explanation of the logic:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question tests your ability to manage resources (developers) and time effectively, a crucial skill for any project manager. The key constraints are:\n\n* **Project Alpha must be completed first:** This means we can't start Project Beta until Alpha is finished.\n* **Limited developer time:** Each developer has a maximum of 40 hours per week.\n* **Project Alpha's coding requirement:** It needs 120 hours of coding.\n* **Timeframe:** Project Alpha must be completed within 3 weeks.\n\n**Solution Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Weekly Capacity:** The team has 5 developers, each working 40 hours per week, giving them a total capacity of 5 * 40 = 200 hours per week.\n\n2. **Determine Required Weekly Hours for Project Alpha:**  Project Alpha needs 120 hours in 3 weeks, meaning we need to allocate 120 / 3 = 40 hours per week to it.\n\n3. **Minimum Developers for Project Alpha:** To allocate 40 hours per week to Project Alpha, we need at least 40 / 40 = 1 developer.\n\n**Why 1 Developer Isn't Enough:**\n\nWhile 1 developer could theoretically handle Project Alpha, the remaining 4 developers would have no work during that week. This is inefficient and potentially disruptive.  \n\n**The Optimal Solution:**\n\nTo ensure consistent work for all developers and meet the 3-week deadline, we need to allocate **3 developers** to Project Alpha. Here's why:\n\n* **Guaranteed Allocation:** This ensures at least 3 * 40 = 120 hours are dedicated to Project Alpha every week, enough to finish the project within the 3-week timeframe. \n* **No Idle Time:** The remaining 2 developers can be assigned to other tasks, keeping them productive and avoiding wasted resources.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Resource Allocation:** This problem demonstrates the importance of balancing resource allocation to ensure efficient project completion. \n* **Time Constraints:** Understanding project timelines and deadlines is crucial for making effective decisions about resource utilization.\n* **Optimizing Workload:**  Minimize idle time for developers to maximize productivity and project efficiency.\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThese types of problems are common in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams, as they test your analytical and problem-solving skills, both of which are crucial for banking roles.

This means Pest Z is the hardest to control, followed by Y, then X, and finally W. \n* **Pesticide Hierarchy:** The information \"A > B > C\" establishes that Pesticide A is the most effective, followed by B, then C.\n* **Specific Pesticide-Pest Relationships:** \n    *  \"B < Z\" indicates that even Pesticide B, the second most effective pesticide, is less effective against Pest Z. \n    * \"A > X\" tells us that Pesticide A is the most effective against Pest X, but it doesn't say anything about its effectiveness against Pest Z.\n\n**Putting it all together:** \n\nWhile Pesticide A is the most effective overall, the fact that even the second-most effective pesticide (B) struggles against Pest Z (B < Z) suggests that Pest Z is likely the most difficult to control, even with the most effective pesticide.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(A) Pesticide A is the most effective against all pests:**  We only know Pesticide A is the most effective overall, not against every single pest.\n* **(B) Pesticide B is the least effective against all pests:**  We know B is less effective than A, but we don't know if it's the least effective against all pests.\n* **(C) Pest W is the easiest to control with any of the pesticides:** While W is the easiest pest to control overall, the information doesn't specify if it's equally easy to control with each pesticide.\n\n**Key takeaways for solving similar questions:**\n\n1. **Understand the meaning of the coded inequalities:**  Recognize that \">\" means \"more effective\" and \"<\" means \"less effective\". \n2. **Look for direct relationships:** Identify specific relationships between pesticides and pests, especially those that highlight the most and least effective combinations.\n3. **Deduce from the information:**  Use the given information to draw logical conclusions, even if the direct answer isn't stated explicitly.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThese types of questions are common in reasoning sections of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. They test your ability to:\n\n* Analyze and interpret data presented in a non-standard format (coded inequalities).\n* Identify key relationships and patterns.\n* Draw logical deductions and make informed conclusions.\n\nBy mastering this skill, you'll be well-equipped to tackle such questions effectively in your exam preparation. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe provided question focuses on calculating the time it takes for two trains traveling towards each other to meet, considering a construction zone where their speeds are halved. Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution, tailored for IBPS PO and SBI PO exam preparation:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of concepts related to **speed, distance, and time**. The core formula involved is:\n\n* **Speed = Distance / Time**\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Relative Speed:** When two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. This is crucial for calculating the time it takes them to meet.\n* **Construction Zone Impact:** The construction zone acts as a speed breaker, reducing the trains' speeds. This affects the time they spend within that zone.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculating Time to Reach Construction Zone:**\n\n   * High-speed train: Time = Distance / Speed = 150 km / 200 km/h = 0.75 hours.\n   * Cargo train: Time = Distance / Speed = 350 km / 80 km/h = 4.375 hours.\n\n2. **Calculating Time Spent in Construction Zone:**\n\n   * High-speed train: Time = Distance / Speed = 100 km / 100 km/h = 1 hour.\n   * Cargo train: Time = Distance / Speed = 100 km / 40 km/h = 2.5 hours.\n\n3. **Calculating Remaining Distance and Time:**\n\n   * High-speed train: Time = Distance / Speed = 50 km / 200 km/h = 0.25 hours.\n   * Cargo train: Time = Distance / Speed = 50 km / 80 km/h = 0.625 hours.\n\n4. **Determining the Meeting Time:**\n\n   * High-speed train: Total time = 0.75 hours + 1 hour + 0.25 hours = 2 hours.\n   * Cargo train: Total time = 4.375 hours + 2.5 hours + 0.625 hours = 7.5 hours.\n\n5. **Meeting Point:**\n\n   * Since the high-speed train travels faster, it will reach the meeting point first, after 2 hours. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3.5 hours.**\n\n**Why this solution is relevant for IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:**\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude Focus:** The problem involves quantitative aptitude concepts frequently tested in these exams.\n* **Time and Work Variation:** This type of problem is a variation of common Time and Work questions, often dealing with speeds and distances.\n* **Logical Reasoning Application:** The solution requires breaking down the problem into steps, applying logic to calculate individual segments and then combining them to reach the final answer.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* Practice similar problems to gain confidence in calculating time, distance, and speed-related questions.\n* Understand the concept of relative speed and its application when objects move towards each other.\n* Develop the ability to identify and address factors affecting speed, like a construction zone in this case.\n\nBy practicing and understanding these concepts, you'll be better equipped to solve similar problems in your IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your ability to understand and work with linear inequalities, a crucial skill for quantitative aptitude sections in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Constraints:**\n\n* **Budget Constraint:**  25h + 40k \u2264 1000. This inequality represents the company's limited budget. The left side represents the total cost: 25h (cost of hiking) + 40k (cost of kayaking). This total cost must be less than or equal to the $1000 budget.\n* **Participation Constraint:** h + k \u2265 30. This inequality ensures that at least 30 employees participate in the event. The left side represents the total number of participants: h (hiking) + k (kayaking). This must be greater than or equal to 30.\n\n**2. Maximizing Kayaking Participants:**\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum value of 'k' (number of employees kayaking) while adhering to both constraints. To do this, we need to minimize 'h' (number of employees hiking).\n\n**3. Analyzing the Options:**\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n* **Option A (k = 10):** This option requires 20 hikers (30 - 10 = 20) to meet the participation constraint.  The budget constraint becomes 25(24) + 40(10) = 1000, meaning the budget is completely utilized. There's no room for more kayakers.\n* **Option B (k = 15):** This option requires 15 hikers (30 - 15 = 15).  The budget constraint becomes 25(16) + 40(15) = 1000. This satisfies both constraints, as the budget is fully utilized, and we have the required number of participants.\n* **Option C (k = 20):** This option requires 10 hikers (30 - 20 = 10).  The budget constraint becomes 25(8) + 40(20) = 1000.  This violates the participation constraint as we need at least 10 hikers.\n* **Option D (k = 25):** This option requires 5 hikers (30 - 25 = 5).  The budget constraint becomes 25(5) + 40(25) = 1125, exceeding the budget.\n\n**4. The Correct Answer:**\n\nOption B (k = 15) satisfies both the budget and participation constraints while maximizing the number of employees going kayaking.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding Inequalities:**  These questions require you to understand how inequalities work, including how to solve them and interpret their solutions.\n* **Minimizing to Maximize:**  To maximize one variable, sometimes you need to minimize the other variable while adhering to constraints.\n* **Analyzing Options:**  Carefully analyze each option, checking if it satisfies all the constraints, and then select the best option that maximizes the desired outcome.\n\nBy practicing these concepts, you'll gain confidence in solving similar problems in your banking exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n**Understanding the Constraints:**\n\nThe question presents several constraints that the supermarket must adhere to while stocking the new organic fruit juices:\n\n1. **Shelf Space:** The supermarket has a maximum shelf space of 120 bottles.\n2. **Minimum Juice Types:** They must stock at least 3 different types of juices.\n3. **Minimum & Maximum per Juice Type:** Each type of juice needs to have at least 15 bottles and a maximum of 40 bottles.\n4. **Juice Category Requirement:** They need to stock at least 2 juices from each of these categories: citrus (Orange, Grapefruit), tropical (Mango, Pineapple), and berry (Cranberry, Blueberry).\n5. **Budget:** They have a budget of $1500 for purchasing the juices.\n\n**Analyzing the Constraints:**\n\n1. **Minimum Bottles:**  Since they need at least 3 juice types with 15 bottles each, the minimum number of bottles required is 3 * 15 = 45.\n2. **Remaining Shelf Space:** This leaves a maximum of 120 - 45 = 75 bottles for the remaining juice types.\n3. **Category Requirement:** The question states that they will stock at least 2 juices from each category. Assuming Grapefruit, Pineapple, and Blueberry are included, we need to stock at least 6 bottles (2 citrus, 2 tropical, 2 berry). \n4. **Budget for Apple Juice:**  The remaining budget for Apple juice after accounting for the minimum category requirement is $1500 - (2 * $9 + 2 * $12 + 2 * $11) = $1436. \n5. **Maximum Apple Juice:** With a cost of $8 per bottle, the maximum number of Apple juice bottles they can buy is $1436 / $8 = 179.5. Since you can't have half a bottle, the maximum is 179 bottles.\n\n**Finding the Range:**\n\n* **Minimum:**  The question states that each juice type must have at least 15 bottles. Therefore, the minimum number of Apple juice bottles is 15.\n* **Maximum:** Considering the remaining budget and other juice requirements, the maximum number of Apple juice bottles is 179. However, the options provided only include ranges up to 40. Within these constraints, the maximum number of Apple juice bottles would be 35, as the remaining shelf space and budget would allow for a maximum of 35 bottles after fulfilling the other requirements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCombining the minimum and maximum values, the possible range for the number of Apple juice bottles the supermarket could stock is **15 \u2264 x \u2264 35**, which corresponds to option **C**.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Break Down the Problem:** Carefully identify and list all the constraints mentioned in the question.\n* **Work with Minimum & Maximum:**  Determine the minimum and maximum values for each constraint, keeping in mind the overall problem context.\n* **Eliminate Options:**  Use the constraints to eliminate incorrect options, focusing on the minimum and maximum requirements.\n* **Consider Additional Information:** Look for clues in the question that might provide additional information about the problem, such as assumed inclusion of certain juice types.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively tackle similar questions involving finding the range of possible values in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",
