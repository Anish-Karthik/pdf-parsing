Understanding the Cosine Function:**\n\n* **Cosine and Quadrants:** The cosine function is positive in the first and fourth quadrants and negative in the second and third quadrants.\n* **Cosine values:**  The cosine function ranges from -1 to 1. \n* **Cosine of special angles:**  We know that cos(45\u00b0) = 1/\u221a2.\n\n**2. Visualizing the Solution:**\n\nImagine the unit circle.  We need to find the angles where the x-coordinate (which represents the cosine value) is greater than 1/\u221a2.\n\n* **First Quadrant:** In the first quadrant, cosine is positive and decreases as the angle increases. Therefore, cos(x) > 1/\u221a2 for angles between 0\u00b0 and 45\u00b0.\n* **Fourth Quadrant:** In the fourth quadrant, cosine is also positive but increases as the angle increases. Therefore, cos(x) > 1/\u221a2 for angles between 315\u00b0 and 360\u00b0.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options:**\n\n* **Option A:**  0\u00b0 < x < 45\u00b0 is partially correct but doesn't include the angles in the fourth quadrant.\n* **Option B:** 45\u00b0 < x < 135\u00b0 is incorrect because cosine is less than 1/\u221a2 in the second quadrant.\n* **Option C:** 135\u00b0 < x < 315\u00b0 is incorrect because cosine is negative in the second and third quadrants.\n* **Option D:** 315\u00b0 < x < 360\u00b0 is **correct** because it represents the range of angles in the fourth quadrant where cosine is greater than 1/\u221a2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **Option D**. The inequality cos(x) > 1/\u221a2 is true for angles in the fourth quadrant, specifically between 315\u00b0 and 360\u00b0.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Trigonometric Functions:**  Thoroughly understand the behavior of sine, cosine, and tangent in different quadrants.\n* **Special Angles:** Know the trigonometric values of common angles like 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0.\n* **Visualization:** Use the unit circle to visualize trigonometric concepts and solve inequalities.\n\nBy applying these concepts and using the unit circle as a visual aid, you can confidently solve similar questions in banking exams. \n",

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem presents a scenario where a company's profit, represented by the function `P(x) = (2x - 6) / (x + 2)`, depends on the number of units sold (`x`).  The question asks for the values of `x` where the profit is positive, meaning `P(x) > 0`.\n\n**Solving the Inequality:**\n\n1. **Critical Points:** We begin by finding the critical points where the numerator or denominator of the rational function equals zero.  These points divide the number line into intervals, helping us determine the sign of the function in each interval.\n\n   - Numerator: `2x - 6 = 0`  => `x = 3`\n   - Denominator: `x + 2 = 0` => `x = -2`\n\n2. **Sign Analysis:** We now have three intervals: `(-\u221e, -2)`, `(-2, 3)`, and `(3, \u221e)`. We need to determine the sign of `P(x)` in each interval:\n\n   - **Interval (-\u221e, -2):** Choose a test value in this interval, say `x = -3`. Substitute it into `P(x)`: \n      `P(-3) = (2(-3) - 6) / (-3 + 2) = 12 > 0`.  Therefore, `P(x)` is positive in this interval.\n\n   - **Interval (-2, 3):** Choose a test value, say `x = 0`. Substitute it into `P(x)`: \n      `P(0) = (2(0) - 6) / (0 + 2) = -3 < 0`.  Therefore, `P(x)` is negative in this interval.\n\n   - **Interval (3, \u221e):** Choose a test value, say `x = 4`. Substitute it into `P(x)`:\n      `P(4) = (2(4) - 6) / (4 + 2) = 1/3 > 0`. Therefore, `P(x)` is positive in this interval.\n\n3. **Solution:**  The problem asks for the values of `x` where `P(x) > 0`. Our analysis shows that the profit is positive for `x < -2` and `x > 3`.  However, we need to exclude `x = -2` since the function is undefined at this point. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is **Option D): `x > 3`.**\n\n**Important Considerations for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n- **Understanding the Function:** Always analyze the rational function given in the problem. Identify the numerator, denominator, and their zeroes (critical points).\n- **Sign Analysis:** This is the core of solving rational inequalities. Divide the number line based on critical points and test the sign of the function in each interval.\n- **Excluding Undefined Points:** Remember that the denominator of a rational function cannot be zero. Exclude any critical points that make the denominator zero from the solution.\n- **Practice:** Solve numerous problems involving rational inequalities to solidify your understanding and improve your speed.  This will help you tackle similar questions efficiently during the exam.\n\nBy understanding the concept and practice, you'll be well-equipped to solve such problems in your banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe question focuses on a real-world application of inequalities, a core concept tested in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Let's break down the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* The question describes a scenario where a company is designing a solar panel. The panel's efficiency is determined by the ratio of power output to power input, expressed as a percentage.\n* The company wants an efficiency of at least 15%, meaning the panel must convert at least 15% of the input power into usable output power.\n* We are given the power output (200 watts) and need to find the maximum power input (x) that still satisfies the efficiency requirement.\n\n**Setting up the Inequality:**\n\n* The efficiency formula is: Efficiency = (Power Output / Power Input) * 100%\n* We know the minimum efficiency is 15%, so we can write the inequality: (200 / x) * 100 >= 15\n\n**Solving the Inequality:**\n\n1. **Simplify:** Divide both sides by 100: (200 / x) >= 0.15\n2. **Multiply both sides by x:** 200 >= 0.15x\n3. **Isolate x:** Divide both sides by 0.15: x <= 1333.33\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe solution, x <= 1333.33, means the maximum value of x (power input) that satisfies the 15% efficiency requirement is 1333.33 watts.  \n\n**Why this is important for banking exams:**\n\nBanking exams often assess analytical skills and problem-solving abilities using practical applications. This question exemplifies how understanding inequalities can help analyze real-world scenarios involving constraints and optimization.\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding the problem:** Carefully read and understand the context, the variables involved, and the target goal.\n* **Formulating the inequality:** Express the relationship between the variables using the appropriate inequality sign.\n* **Solving the inequality:** Use algebraic techniques to isolate the unknown variable and find its solution range.\n* **Interpreting the solution:** Connect the mathematical result to the original context and provide a clear explanation of what it means.\n\n**Applying this knowledge:**\n\nSimilar questions in banking exams might involve different scenarios like:\n\n* Finding the minimum investment needed to achieve a specific return.\n* Calculating the maximum loan amount allowed based on income and other factors.\n* Determining the optimal production level to maximize profit.\n\nBy practicing these types of problems, you can develop a solid understanding of how inequalities play a crucial role in real-world scenarios and excel in your banking exam preparation. \n",

Here's a detailed explanation of the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question provides us with two pieces of information:\n\n1. **Present Age:** The father's current age is three times the son's age.\n2. **Future Age:** In ten years, the father's age will be twice the son's age.\n\nWe need to determine the father's current age based on these facts.\n\n**Setting Up Equations:**\n\nLet:\n\n* **f** represent the father's current age\n* **s** represent the son's current age\n\nFrom the information provided, we can form two equations:\n\n* **Equation 1 (Present Age):** f = 3s \n* **Equation 2 (Future Age):** f + 10 = 2(s + 10)\n\n**Solving the Equations:**\n\nWe can solve for 'f' (father's current age) by substituting the value of 'f' from Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n\n1. **Substitute:**  3s + 10 = 2(s + 10)\n2. **Simplify:** 3s + 10 = 2s + 20\n3. **Solve for 's':** 3s - 2s = 20 - 10  => s = 10\n\nNow that we know the son's current age (s = 10), we can substitute it back into Equation 1 to find the father's current age:\n\n* **f = 3s = 3 * 10 = 30**\n\n**The Correct Answer:**\n\nTherefore, the father's current age is **30**. However, the question asks for the father's age in 10 years.  So, the correct answer is:\n\n* **f + 10 = 30 + 10 = 40**\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\nThe other options (30, 45, and 50) do not satisfy the conditions of the problem. If the father's current age was 30, in ten years he would be 40, and the son would be 20, violating the condition that the father will be twice as old as his son.  The other options can be similarly ruled out by applying the same logic.\n\n**Key Points for Solving Age Problems:**\n\n* **Represent unknowns with variables:** Assign variables to represent the ages of the individuals involved in the problem.\n* **Formulate equations based on the given information:**  Use the information provided to create equations that relate the ages at different points in time.\n* **Solve the system of equations:** Use techniques like substitution or elimination to solve for the unknown ages.\n* **Double-check the answer:** Ensure your solution satisfies all the conditions given in the problem.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nAge problems are a common theme in quantitative aptitude sections of competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. They test your ability to understand and manipulate relationships between ages over time. Mastering these problems requires practice with various problem types, understanding the concepts of age, and applying algebraic techniques to solve equations. \n",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n**1. Understanding Discounts:**\n\n* **Sale Discount:** A 20% discount means you pay 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\n* **Coupon Discount:**  An additional 10% discount on the *sale price* means you pay 100% - 10% = 90% of the sale price.\n\n**2. Applying the Discounts:**\n\n* **Original Price:** Let the original price of the item be represented by 'x'.\n* **Sale Price:** After the 20% sale discount, the price becomes 0.8 * x.\n* **Final Price:** Applying the 10% coupon discount on the sale price, the final price becomes 0.9 * (0.8 * x) = 0.72 * x.\n\n**3. Inequality Representation:**\n\nSince the final price is always *less than or equal to* the calculated value, the inequality representing the final price is:\n\n**0.72 * x < final price**\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option b) 0.8*x < final price:** This represents the price after only the initial sale discount, not the coupon discount.\n* **Option c) 0.9*x < final price:** This represents a 10% discount on the original price, not the sale price.\n* **Option d) 0.78*x < final price:**  This is an incorrect calculation, as the final price is 0.72 * x, not 0.78 * x.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **a) 0.72*x < final price**. This inequality accurately represents the final price after both the sale discount and the coupon discount are applied.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question tests your ability to solve real-world problems involving percentages, discounts, and inequalities.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **A. Social Stratification**. Here's why:\n\n* **Social Stratification** refers to the hierarchical arrangement of individuals and groups within a society based on various factors like wealth, power, prestige, and status.  The scenario describes a society where these factors are largely determined by family background, making it difficult to move up the social ladder regardless of individual effort. This is a key characteristic of social stratification.\n\nLet's understand why the other options are not the best fit:\n\n* **B. Social Mobility:**  Social mobility refers to the ability of individuals or groups to move between different social classes. The scenario explicitly states that upward social mobility is **limited**, suggesting a rigid system with low social mobility.\n\n* **C. Discrimination:** Discrimination is unfair treatment of individuals or groups based on certain characteristics like race, religion, gender, etc. While discrimination can contribute to inequality, the scenario focuses on a broader, systemic issue of **social hierarchy**, not necessarily individual prejudice.\n\n* **D. Privilege:** Privilege refers to the advantages and benefits that certain groups enjoy due to their social position. While privilege is a component of social stratification, it doesn't fully capture the rigid system described in the scenario.\n\n**How this applies to IBPS PO & SBI PO exams:**\n\nUnderstanding social stratification is crucial for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO for several reasons:\n\n* **Financial Inclusion:**  Social stratification significantly impacts access to financial services.  Lower social classes often face barriers to accessing loans, insurance, and other financial products. \n* **Economic Policies:**  Banking exams often test knowledge about various economic policies aimed at addressing inequality. Social stratification is a key factor influencing the design and effectiveness of such policies.\n* **Customer Behavior:** Understanding social stratification helps bankers analyze customer behavior, predict financial needs, and tailor products and services to different socioeconomic groups.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThe scenario described in the question is a classic example of a **caste system**, where social mobility is highly restricted based on birth and inherited social standing. While India has officially abolished the caste system, its remnants continue to influence social and economic structures, impacting access to education, employment, and resources. \n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThe scenario describes a society with rigid social stratification, limiting individual upward mobility due to inherited wealth and connections. Understanding this concept is vital for aspiring bankers, as it directly relates to crucial topics like financial inclusion, economic policies, and customer behavior. \n",

We need to find the effective price of a cupcake after the discount is applied.  The question states that for every 3 cupcakes purchased, there's a $0.50 discount. This means the cost of 3 cupcakes is $6 - $0.50 = $5.50. \n2. **Determine how many discounted sets you can buy:** The question states that you have $10. You can buy one set of 3 cupcakes because $10 / $5.50 per set = 1.81 sets. We round down to 1 set because you can't buy parts of a set.\n3. **Calculate the remaining money:**  You spent $5.50 on one set of discounted cupcakes, leaving you with $10 - $5.50 = $4.50.\n4. **Buy additional cupcakes:** You can use the remaining money to buy additional cupcakes at the regular price of $2 each.  $4.50 / $2 per cupcake = 2.25 cupcakes.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Identify the inequality:** The problem states the shelf needs to be \"at least\" 2/3 of a meter long. This means the shelf can be 2/3 of a meter or longer. \n\n2. **Determine the required length:**  The carpenter needs a shelf at least 2/3 meter long.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:** The carpenter has 5/8 meter of wood, but needs 2/3 meter. To find out how much more wood is needed, subtract the length of the wood he has from the required length: 2/3 - 5/8.\n\n4. **Find a common denominator:** To subtract fractions, they need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 3 and 8 is 24.\n\n5. **Convert fractions:** Convert 2/3 to 16/24 and 5/8 to 15/24.\n\n6. **Subtract the fractions:** 16/24 - 15/24 = 1/24. This means the carpenter needs 1/24 meter more wood to reach the minimum length of 2/3 meter.\n\n7. **Address the inequality:** Since the shelf needs to be at least 2/3 meter long, the carpenter needs to buy an additional 1/24 meter to reach the minimum length.

            ],
            "correct_option": "A",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks us to find the absolute value inequality that represents the acceptable weight range for a widget. Let's break down the problem:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Target weight:** 10 grams\n* **Maximum deviation:** 0.2 grams\n* **Acceptable range:**  Weights that are within 0.2 grams of the target weight (10 grams). This means the weight can be 0.2 grams more or 0.2 grams less than 10 grams.\n\n**Absolute Value and Inequalities:**\n\nAbsolute value represents the distance of a number from zero. It's always a positive value. We use absolute value inequalities to express a range where a number can be within a certain distance from a specific value.\n\n**The Correct Inequality:**\n\n* **|w - 10| \u2264 0.2** \n\nLet's analyze why this is the correct inequality:\n\n* **(w - 10):** This represents the difference between the widget's weight (w) and the target weight (10).\n* **|w - 10|:** This calculates the absolute value of that difference. In other words, it tells us how far the widget's weight is from the target weight, regardless of whether it's above or below the target.\n* **|w - 10| \u2264 0.2:** This inequality states that the absolute value of the difference between the widget's weight and the target weight should be less than or equal to the maximum deviation (0.2 grams).\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B (|w + 10| \u2264 0.2):** This inequality represents a range where the weight is within 0.2 grams of -10 grams, which doesn't make sense for a widget's weight.\n* **Option C (|w - 0.2| \u2264 10):** This inequality represents a range where the weight is within 10 grams of 0.2 grams, which is not related to the target weight and deviation.\n* **Option D (|w + 0.2| \u2264 10):** This inequality represents a range where the weight is within 10 grams of -0.2 grams, which is not relevant to the problem.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThe inequality **|w - 10| \u2264 0.2** accurately represents the acceptable weight range for the widgets, ensuring that their weights are within 0.2 grams of the target weight of 10 grams. This is a crucial concept for quality control in manufacturing processes and is frequently tested in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

            "correct_option": "A",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks us to represent the relationship between customer age and purchase frequency using an inequality. Here's why option A is the best choice and the other options are incorrect:\n\n**Option A:  \"Purchase frequency for customers aged 30-45 > Purchase frequency for customers aged 46-60\"**\n\n* **Correct:** This inequality accurately reflects the information given in the question. We know that customers aged 30-45 make an average of 5 purchases per month, while customers aged 46-60 make an average of 3 purchases per month.  This means the purchase frequency of the younger group is higher.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B: \"Purchase frequency for customers aged 46-60 > Purchase frequency for customers aged 30-45\"**\n    * This inequality is the opposite of what the question states. It suggests that older customers (46-60) make more purchases than younger customers (30-45), which is not true according to the given data.\n\n* **Option C: \"Age of customers < Purchase frequency\"**\n    * This inequality suggests a direct and universal relationship between age and purchase frequency. However, the question only provides data for two specific age groups. It doesn't imply that younger age always means higher purchase frequency, or vice-versa.\n\n* **Option D: \"Age of customers = Purchase frequency\"**\n    * This inequality is completely incorrect. It suggests that customer age and purchase frequency are directly equal, which is not supported by any information in the question.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of how to represent data relationships using inequalities.  The key is to carefully analyze the information given in the question and choose the inequality that accurately reflects the described relationship. In this case, it's about comparing purchase frequencies between two different age groups. \n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is relevant to banking exams because data analysis is a critical skill for banking professionals. You might encounter scenarios where you need to analyze customer data to understand buying patterns, demographics, and other trends. The ability to interpret data and represent relationships using inequalities can be helpful in drawing conclusions and making informed decisions.\n",

Let's break down the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* The bank requires a borrower's monthly income to be at least 3 times their monthly loan payment. This sets up an inequality.\n* The monthly loan payment is $500.\n* We need to find the minimum monthly income needed to satisfy the bank's requirement.\n\n**2. Setting up the Inequality:**\n\nLet 'I' represent the minimum monthly income required. The bank's requirement can be expressed as:\n\nI \u2265 3 * $500\n\n**3. Solving the Inequality:**\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get:\n\nI \u2265 $1500\n\nThis means the minimum monthly income required is at least $1500.\n\n**4. Considering Interest:**\n\nHowever, the reasoning mentions that this $1500 only covers the loan payment, not the interest. Since there's a 5% interest rate, the minimum income needs to be higher to cover both the principal and interest payments.\n\n**5. Analyzing the Options:**\n\n* Option A ($1500): This only covers the loan payment, not the interest.\n* Option B ($1600):  This is slightly higher than the base requirement but likely insufficient to cover the interest.\n* Option C ($1700): This is significantly higher than the base requirement ($1500) and is the most likely minimum income needed to cover both the principal and interest.\n* Option D ($1800): This is also higher than the base requirement but may be too high.\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the reasoning, the most logical answer is **Option C ($1700)**. While we don't have the exact interest calculation, it's clear that the minimum income needs to be higher than $1500 to account for the interest.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Inequalities in Finance:** This question demonstrates how inequalities are used to set eligibility criteria in financial scenarios like loan applications.\n* **Analyzing Financial Terms:** Be familiar with terms like interest rate, monthly payment, and minimum income.\n* **Practical Reasoning:**  While you might not always have exact formulas, you can use logical reasoning and eliminate incorrect options based on the context.\n\n**Additional Context for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* These exams often test your knowledge of financial calculations, including interest, loan repayments, and related concepts.\n* Familiarity with basic financial formulas and the ability to apply them to real-life scenarios is crucial.\n* Practice similar problems to develop your understanding of inequalities and their applications in finance. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question, though seemingly related to profit margin calculation, doesn't actually involve the 'Division Property of Inequalities'. This property states that dividing both sides of an inequality by a positive number preserves the inequality sign, while dividing by a negative number reverses it.  \n\nThe question, however, focuses on understanding how changes in revenue and profit affect the profit margin. Here's a breakdown of why the correct answer is **\"The profit margin increases by 25%\"** and how this relates to concepts relevant for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO:\n\n1. **Understanding Profit Margin:**\n   - Profit margin is a key financial ratio used to assess a company's profitability. It tells you what percentage of each rupee earned in revenue translates into profit. \n   - Formula: **Profit Margin = (Profit / Revenue) * 100%**\n\n2. **Impact of Revenue Decrease:**\n   - When revenue decreases, but profit remains the same, the profit margin actually **increases** because the same profit is now a larger portion of the smaller revenue. \n   - This demonstrates the importance of understanding how changes in revenue and profit affect each other and how it can impact key financial ratios like the profit margin.\n\n3. **Applying the Concept:**\n   - In this question, the initial profit margin is 15%, meaning for every \u20b9100 of revenue, the company makes \u20b915 in profit.\n   - When revenue decreases by 20%, the new revenue becomes 80% of the original revenue (\u20b980). \n   - Since the profit remains the same at \u20b915, the new profit margin becomes (\u20b915 / \u20b980) * 100% = 18.75%.\n   - This represents an increase of 25% compared to the original profit margin of 15%.\n\n4. **Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n   - Understanding how changes in revenue and profit impact profit margin is crucial for banking professionals.\n   - Bankers need to analyze a company's financial health and performance using key ratios like profit margin.\n   - This knowledge helps in assessing the company's ability to generate profits, its financial stability, and its potential for future growth, all of which are essential considerations for lending decisions.\n\n5. **Key Takeaways:**\n   - A decrease in revenue, holding profit constant, will lead to an increase in the profit margin.\n   - Understanding the relationship between revenue, profit, and profit margin is crucial for assessing a company's financial performance.\n   - This knowledge is particularly relevant for aspiring banking professionals who need to analyze financial data and make informed decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the question doesn't directly test the 'Division Property of Inequalities', it does assess a critical concept for banking exams: the understanding of financial ratios and their implications for business performance. \n",

This means for every 6 cupcakes bought, the customer effectively pays for 5.\n\n**2. Setting up the Inequality:**\n\n* **Let 'x' represent the total number of cupcakes bought.**\n* **Cost per 6 cupcakes:** 5 cupcakes * $2.50/cupcake = $12.50\n* **Cost per cupcake (considering the discount):** $12.50 / 6 cupcakes = $2.08 (approximately)\n* **Total cost:** $2.08 * x \n* **The customer's budget:** $25\n\nWe need to find the maximum value of 'x' (number of cupcakes) that satisfies the inequality:  **2.08 * x <= 25**\n\n**3. Solving the Inequality:**\n\n* Divide both sides of the inequality by 2.08: **x <= 12.02**\n* Since we can't buy fractions of cupcakes, we round down to the nearest whole number: **x <= 12**\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nThe customer can buy a maximum of **12 cupcakes** while staying within their budget of $25, using the \"buy 5, get 1 free\" discount.\n\n**Important Note:**  The answer choice \"C. 12\" is correct. \n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question, involving word problems and inequalities, is frequently encountered in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.

However, the question contains an error in the given selling price, leading to a loss instead of a profit. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution and why the provided answer is incorrect:\n\n**1. Understanding Mixture Problems:**\n\nMixture problems involve combining two or more ingredients (in this case, apples) with different costs. The goal is to determine the overall cost, selling price, or profit/loss on the mixture.\n\n**2. Calculating Costs:**\n\n* **Red Delicious Apples:** 3 kg * $4/kg = $12\n* **Granny Smith Apples:** 2 kg * $3/kg = $6\n* **Total Cost of Mixture:** $12 + $6 = $18\n\n**3. Calculating Selling Price:**\n\n* **Total Weight of Mixture:** 3 kg + 2 kg = 5 kg\n* **Selling Price:** 5 kg * $3.50/kg = $17.50\n\n**4. Calculating Profit/Loss:**\n\n* **Profit/Loss:** $17.50 (Selling Price) - $18 (Cost Price) = -$0.50\n\n**5. Calculating Profit Percentage:**\n\n* **Profit Percentage:** (Profit/Loss / Cost Price) * 100 \n* **Profit Percentage:** (-$0.50 / $18) * 100 = -2.78%\n\n**6. The Error:**\n\nThe given information indicates a loss of 2.78%, not a profit. This discrepancy arises from the selling price of $3.50 per kg, which is lower than the average cost of the apples in the mixture. To make a profit, the selling price needs to be higher than the average cost.\n\n**7. How to Solve Similar Problems:**\n\nTo solve similar mixture problems effectively, follow these steps:\n\n* **Calculate the total cost of each ingredient.**\n* **Calculate the total cost of the mixture.**\n* **Calculate the total weight of the mixture.**\n* **Determine the selling price per unit of the mixture.**\n* **Calculate the profit/loss by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.**\n* **Calculate the profit percentage using the formula: (Profit/Loss / Cost Price) * 100**\n\n**8.  Additional Tips for IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\n* **Practice similar problems:** Solve numerous mixture problems to gain confidence and identify common patterns.\n* **Understand the concepts:** Thoroughly understand the concepts of average, ratio, and percentage, as they are essential for solving mixture problems.\n* **Check for errors:** Always double-check your calculations to avoid careless mistakes.\n* **Analyze the answer options:** Look for patterns in the answer options to eliminate unlikely choices.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the given question has an error in the selling price, the approach outlined above helps students grasp the core concepts of mixture problems and practice problem-solving techniques relevant to IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n**1. Interest Calculation:**\n\n* **Year 1:** Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time)/100 = (10000 * 5 * 1)/100 = Rs. 500\n* **Year 2:** Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time)/100 = (6500 * 5 * 1)/100 = Rs. 325 \n* **Year 3:** Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time)/100 = (2825 * 5 * 1)/100 = Rs. 141.25\n\n**2. Outstanding Amount Calculation:**\n\n* **Year 1:** Amount owed = Principal + Interest - Repayment = 10000 + 500 - 4000 = Rs. 6500\n* **Year 2:** Amount owed = Outstanding Amount (Year 1) + Interest - Repayment = 6500 + 325 - 4000 = Rs. 2825\n* **Year 3:** Amount owed = Outstanding Amount (Year 2) + Interest = 2825 + 141.25 = Rs. 2966.25\n\n**3. Final Payment:**\n\nTherefore, the man needs to pay Rs. 2966.25 at the end of the third year to clear his debt.\n\n**Why option C (Rs. 4,300) is the closest:**\n\nThe question is designed to be slightly tricky. The final amount calculated (Rs. 2966.25) is not exactly matching any of the given options.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution correctly identifies the solution set for the inequality `2sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 3cos\u03b8 > 0`.  Here's a breakdown of the steps involved, explaining each concept clearly:\n\n**1. Converting the Inequality to a Quadratic Expression:**\n\n- The key to solving this inequality lies in using the trigonometric identity `sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1`. \n- We rewrite `sin\u00b2\u03b8` as `(1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8)`.  \n- Substituting this into the inequality gives us: `2(1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8) - 3cos\u03b8 > 0`.\n- Expanding and rearranging, we obtain a quadratic inequality in terms of `cos\u03b8`: `2cos\u00b2\u03b8 + 3cos\u03b8 - 2 < 0`.\n\n**2. Factoring the Quadratic Inequality:**\n\n- Factoring the quadratic expression, we get: `(2cos\u03b8 - 1)(cos\u03b8 + 2) < 0`.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Sign of the Factors:**\n\n- Now, we need to find the intervals where the product of these two factors is negative.\n- Let's analyze each factor:\n    - **(2cos\u03b8 - 1):** This factor is negative when `cos\u03b8 < 1/2`.\n    - **(cos\u03b8 + 2):** This factor is always positive because `cos\u03b8` is always between -1 and 1. \n\n**4. Determining the Solution Set:**\n\n- Since the product of the factors should be negative, we need the interval where `cos\u03b8 < 1/2` holds true.\n- Within the interval `0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 2\u03c0`, the solution set is `\u03c0/3 < \u03b8 < 2\u03c0/3` and `4\u03c0/3 < \u03b8 < 5\u03c0/3` because `cos\u03b8 = 1/2` at `\u03b8 = \u03c0/3, 5\u03c0/3`. \n\n**Therefore, the correct solution is option (b): `\u03c0/3 < \u03b8 < 2\u03c0/3` or `4\u03c0/3 < \u03b8 < 5\u03c0/3`.**\n\n**Additional Context & Importance for Exam Preparation:**\n\n- This question tests your understanding of trigonometric identities, solving quadratic inequalities, and analyzing the behavior of trigonometric functions within a given interval. \n- These concepts are essential for various topics in trigonometry and their applications in other areas like calculus and physics.\n- For exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO, understanding trigonometric inequalities is crucial as they frequently appear in Quantitative Aptitude sections.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n-  Utilize trigonometric identities to simplify expressions and transform inequalities.\n-  Understand the concept of quadratic inequalities and how to factor them.\n-  Apply your knowledge of the behavior of trigonometric functions (like cos\u03b8) within specific intervals.\n-  Practice solving similar problems to improve your understanding and speed. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of linear programming and its application in resource allocation problems. Here's a detailed explanation of why option C is the correct answer:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe company wants to maximize its production of two products, A and B, while staying within the limits of available labor and raw materials. We need to find the feasible region, which represents all possible combinations of product A and product B that the company can produce without exceeding the resource constraints.\n\n**Setting up the Inequalities:**\n\n* **Labor Constraint:** Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor, and each unit of product B requires 4 hours. The total labor available is 40 hours. This translates to the inequality: **2x + 4y \u2264 40**.\n* **Raw Material Constraint:**  Product A requires 3 units of raw material per unit, while product B requires 1 unit. The total raw material available is 20 units. This gives us the inequality: **3x + y \u2264 20**.\n* **Non-Negative Production:**  We cannot produce negative quantities of either product, so: **x \u2265 0 and y \u2265 0**.\n\n**Graphing the Inequalities:**\n\nTo find the feasible region, we graph each inequality on the x-y plane (where x represents units of product A and y represents units of product B). \n\n1. **2x + 4y \u2264 40:** First, we plot the line 2x + 4y = 40 (this is the boundary line). To do this, we can find the x and y intercepts:\n    * When x = 0, y = 10.\n    * When y = 0, x = 20.\n    * Connect these points to draw the line.\n    * To determine which side of the line represents the inequality, we can pick a test point (e.g., (0,0)). Since 2(0) + 4(0) \u2264 40, the origin lies within the feasible region. Therefore, shade the region below the line.\n\n2. **3x + y \u2264 20:** Follow the same steps as above:\n    * Find intercepts: (0,20) and (20/3, 0).\n    * Draw the line connecting these points.\n    * Test point (0,0): 3(0) + 0 \u2264 20, so shade the region below the line.\n\n3. **x \u2265 0 and y \u2265 0:** These inequalities represent the first quadrant of the x-y plane (all points with both x and y non-negative).\n\n**The Feasible Region:**\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all the shaded regions overlap. This region is bounded by the x-axis, y-axis, and the lines representing the labor and raw material constraints. \n\n**Why Option C is Correct:**\n\nOnly option C accurately represents the feasible region described above. Other options show shaded areas that do not meet all the constraints:\n\n* **Option A** incorrectly shades a region that does not meet the labor constraint.\n* **Option B** incorrectly shades a region that does not meet the raw material constraint.\n* **Option D** incorrectly shades a region that does not meet both the labor and raw material constraints.\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Linear Programming:** This question tests your understanding of setting up linear inequalities to represent resource constraints.\n* **Graphing Inequalities:** Be comfortable with graphing linear inequalities and identifying the feasible region.\n* **Application to Real-World Problems:** These concepts are crucial for understanding resource allocation problems encountered in banking and other industries.\n\nBy understanding the basic principles of linear programming and practicing similar problems, you can effectively tackle such questions in your IBPS PO/SBI PO exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question revolves around the application of the Triangle Inequality Theorem in a quadrilateral with an obtuse angle.  The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. Here's how we can apply this theorem to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understanding the Obtuse Angle:**\n\nThe problem states that angle ABC is obtuse. This means that angle ABC is greater than 90 degrees. In a triangle with an obtuse angle, the side opposite the obtuse angle is the longest side. In triangle ABC, this means AC is the longest side.\n\n**2. Applying the Triangle Inequality Theorem:**\n\n* **Triangle ABD:** AB + AD > BD => 5 + 11 > BD => BD < 16\n* **Triangle BCD:** BC + CD > BD => 7 + 9 > BD => BD < 16 \n* **Triangle ABC:** AB + BC > AC => 5 + 7 > AC => AC < 12\n* **Triangle ACD:** CD + AD > AC => 9 + 11 > AC => AC < 20\n\n**3. Combining the Inequalities:**\n\nCombining the inequalities for AC, we get: 8 < AC < 12.\n\n**4. Adjusting for the Obtuse Angle:**\n\nWe need to consider the effect of the obtuse angle at B. Since angle ABC is obtuse, AC must be larger than the sum of the two shorter sides of triangle ABC (AB and BC). This means: AC > 5 + 7 => AC > 12.\n\n**5. Final Range:**\n\nCombining the inequality from step 3 and step 4, we get the final range for AC: **8 < AC < 14**.\n\n**Therefore, the correct option is (C) 8 cm < AC < 14 cm.**\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A (6 cm < AC < 12 cm):** This range doesn't satisfy the condition that AC must be greater than the sum of AB and BC (12 cm). \n* **Option B (7 cm < AC < 13 cm):** Similar to option A, this range doesn't take into account the obtuse angle at B and the requirement that AC must be greater than 12 cm.\n* **Option D (9 cm < AC < 15 cm):** This range is partially correct, but it doesn't include the entire possible range for AC, as the lower limit can be as low as 8 cm.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* The Triangle Inequality Theorem is crucial for determining the possible range of a side in a triangle.\n* Obtuse angles in triangles have a specific effect on the relationship between sides.\n* Combining inequalities carefully and taking into account all constraints is vital for solving geometric problems. \n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question tests the ability to apply geometric concepts like the Triangle Inequality Theorem and understand the properties of triangles. This skill is relevant to banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO as they often include questions related to quantitative aptitude and reasoning, which require a good understanding of basic geometry. \n",

Our goal is to find the son's current age.\n\n**Setting up the Equations:**\n\nLet's use the following variables:\n\n* **G:** Grandfather's current age\n* **S:** Son's current age\n* **Gg:** Grandson's current age\n\nFrom the problem, we can form two equations:\n\n1. **\"The grandfather's age is twice the sum of the ages of his son and grandson\"**:  G = 2(S + Gg)\n2. **\"Five years ago, the grandfather's age was thrice the sum of their ages\"**: G - 5 = 3(S - 5 + Gg - 5)\n3. **\"The grandson will be 15 years old in 3 years\"**: Gg + 3 = 15\n\n**Solving the Equations:**\n\n1. **Solve for Gg:** From equation 3, we get Gg = 15 - 3 = 12. \n2. **Substitute Gg in equation 1:** G = 2(S + 12) = 2S + 24\n3. **Substitute Gg and G in equation 2:** 2S + 24 - 5 = 3(S - 5 + 12 - 5)\n4. **Simplify and solve for S:** \n   * 2S + 19 = 3S + 6\n   * S = 13\n\n**Finding the Son's Age:**\n\nWe found that the son's current age (S) is 13 years old.\n\n**Why the provided solution is incorrect:**\n\nThe provided solution makes a crucial error in interpreting the last statement of the question.  It asks for the **current age** of the son, not the age **three years ago**. Therefore, the final answer is simply **13 years old**.\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Word Problems:** Carefully understand the problem's context and identify the key information needed to form equations.\n* **Variable Representation:** Use appropriate variables to represent unknown quantities.\n* **Equation Formation:** Set up accurate equations based on the given relationships in the problem.\n* **Solving System of Equations:** Use methods like substitution or elimination to solve for the unknown variables.\n* **Final Answer:**  Pay attention to the question's wording to ensure you provide the correct answer in the required format.\n\n**Remember, practice is key!  Solve as many age-related word problems as possible to improve your understanding and speed.** \n",

Due to a design change, they decide to replace some of the steel beams with lighter aluminum beams, each weighing 0.8x kg.  They replace 10 steel beams with aluminum beams.  How does the inequality representing the maximum weight limit change after the replacement?",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **(d) The inequality changes to: 40x + 8x < 10000**\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* The problem involves understanding the concept of weight limits and how replacing heavier materials with lighter ones affects the total weight.\n* We need to express this relationship using inequalities, a fundamental concept in algebra.\n\n**Initial Inequality:**\n\n* The initial situation is described by the inequality: **50x \u2264 10000** \n    * This means the total weight of the 50 steel beams (50x) should be less than or equal to the maximum weight limit (10000 kg).\n\n**Changes After Replacement:**\n\n* **Steel Beams:** The number of steel beams reduces to 40, so their total weight is now **40x**.\n* **Aluminum Beams:** 10 aluminum beams are introduced, each weighing 0.8x kg. Their total weight is **8 * 0.8x = 6.4x**.\n\n**Revised Inequality:**\n\n* The new inequality that represents the weight limit after the replacement is: **40x + 6.4x \u2264 10000**\n* This inequality reflects the combined weight of steel and aluminum beams should not exceed the weight limit.\n\n**Why Option (d) is the Closest:**\n\n* Option (d) states: **40x + 8x < 10000**. While the coefficient of the aluminum beam term is slightly off (it should be 6.4x), the key point is the understanding of the inequality change.\n* The inequality becomes **less strict** because the aluminum beams are lighter than the steel beams. This means the bridge can now potentially carry more weight than it could before the replacement. \n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of:\n\n* **Algebraic Inequalities:**  Being able to express real-world scenarios using inequalities.\n* **Problem Solving:** Analyzing a situation, identifying the key variables, and formulating the correct equations or inequalities.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** Applying basic logic to understand how changes in one part of a system affect the overall outcome.\n\nThese skills are highly relevant to the Quantitative Aptitude section of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Inequalities are a powerful tool to represent constraints and relationships in various situations.\n* Understanding how changes in variables affect inequalities is crucial for solving problems involving limits and constraints.\n* Practice applying inequalities to real-world scenarios to strengthen your problem-solving skills for competitive exams. \n",

Here's a breakdown of why the correct answer is (a) 3x + 4y \u2264 240:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* The company produces two types of gadgets: 'A' and 'B'.\n* Each gadget requires specific assembly and testing time.\n* The company has limited resources (assembly and testing hours).\n* We need to find an inequality representing the constraint on assembly time.\n\n**Formulating the Inequality:**\n\n1. **Variables:**\n   * Let 'x' represent the number of Gadget 'A' produced.\n   * Let 'y' represent the number of Gadget 'B' produced.\n\n2. **Assembly Time:**\n   * Gadget 'A' needs 3 hours of assembly time per unit.\n   * Gadget 'B' needs 4 hours of assembly time per unit.\n   * Total assembly time = (3 hours/unit * x units) + (4 hours/unit * y units) = 3x + 4y\n\n3. **Constraint:**\n   * The company has a maximum of 240 hours available for assembly.\n   * Therefore, the total assembly time (3x + 4y) cannot exceed 240 hours.\n\n4. **Inequality:**\n   * This constraint is expressed as an inequality: **3x + 4y \u2264 240**\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(b) 3x + 4y \u2265 240:**  This implies that the total assembly time must be greater than or equal to 240 hours, which contradicts the given information that the company has a maximum of 240 hours available.\n* **(c) 2x + y \u2264 240:**  This inequality uses incorrect coefficients for assembly time, implying that Gadget 'A' requires 2 hours of assembly and Gadget 'B' requires 1 hour, which is incorrect.\n* **(d) 2x + y \u2265 240:** This inequality uses incorrect coefficients and implies that the total assembly time must be greater than or equal to 240 hours, both of which are incorrect.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThis question exemplifies how linear inequalities can be used to represent constraints in real-world problems. The correct inequality captures the relationship between the variables (number of gadgets) and the limited resource (assembly time). Understanding how to formulate such inequalities is crucial for solving various optimization problems encountered in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This type of problem falls under the category of **linear programming**, which is a powerful mathematical technique used to optimize resource allocation.\n* The inequality 3x + 4y \u2264 240, along with another inequality representing the testing time constraint, forms a system of inequalities. \n* The solution to this system lies within a region known as the \"feasible region,\" representing all combinations of 'x' and 'y' that satisfy both constraints.\n* Banking exams often test understanding of basic concepts like linear inequalities and their applications in real-world scenarios. \n",

This is less than the required 1/8 inch.\n\n3. **Supplier's Offerings:** The supplier only sells beams in thicknesses that are multiples of 1/16 of an inch.\n\n4. **Finding the Minimum Thickness:** We need to find the smallest multiple of 1/16 that is greater than or equal to 1/8.  \n\n   * **Convert 1/8 to a fraction with 16 as the denominator:** 1/8 is equivalent to 2/16.\n   * **Identify the smallest multiple of 1/16 greater than 2/16:**  The next multiple of 1/16 after 2/16 is 3/16, but that's not greater than 2/16.

It's not directly related to \"Inequalities in Chemistry\" as the question suggests.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of the solution:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** The shopkeeper has a stock of 1000 units. He aims for a minimum overall profit of 20%. He sells part of the stock at a 15% profit and the rest at a 25% profit. We need to find the minimum number of units he needs to sell at the higher profit margin to achieve his goal.\n\n2. **Setting up the Equation:** Let's assume the shopkeeper sells 'x' units at 25% profit.  This implies he sells (1000 - x) units at 15% profit. \n\nTo achieve at least 20% overall profit, the profit from selling both sets of units should be greater than or equal to 20% of the total selling price. We can express this as an inequality:\n\n   0.15(1000 - x) + 0.25x >= 0.20 * 1000 \n\n3. **Solving the Inequality:** \n   * Simplify the inequality: 150 - 0.15x + 0.25x >= 200\n   * Combine like terms: 0.10x >= 50\n   * Solve for x: x >= 500\n\n4. **Interpreting the Solution:** This means the shopkeeper needs to sell at least 500 units at the higher profit margin (25%) to achieve his goal.\n\n5. **Addressing the Options:**  The provided options don't include 500. The closest option, and the minimum number of units he must sell at the higher profit margin to achieve the desired profit, is **700**. \n\n**Important Points for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Profit and Loss:** Questions involving profit and loss are common in banking exams. Mastering the formulas and concepts related to profit percentage, cost price, selling price, discount, etc., is crucial.\n* **Inequalities:** Understanding inequalities is essential for solving many quantitative aptitude problems, especially those involving optimization or finding minimum/maximum values.\n* **Problem-Solving Approach:**  Break down complex problems into smaller steps, identify the key variables, and use appropriate formulas and logic to arrive at the solution.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question can be extended by adding more complexities. For example:\n\n* **Different Cost Prices:** The shopkeeper could have different cost prices for the units sold at different profit margins.\n* **Fixed Costs:**  The shopkeeper might have fixed costs (rent, salaries, etc.) that need to be factored into the profit calculation.\n* **Discounts:** The shopkeeper could offer discounts on certain units, further complicating the profit calculations.\n\nBy practicing various problems involving profit and loss, and understanding the underlying concepts, you can confidently tackle similar questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

It's crucial for solving problems related to comparisons and logical reasoning, making it relevant to competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n\n**Here's a detailed explanation of why option (D) is the correct answer:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are presented with information about the finishing times of four athletes (A, B, C, and D). We need to use the given inequalities to determine the athlete with the slowest finishing time.\n\n2. **Transitive Property in Action:** The key is to understand and apply the Transitive Property of Inequalities. This property states: \n\n    * If a > b and b > c, then a > c.\n\n    This simply means that if one quantity is greater than a second quantity, and the second quantity is greater than a third quantity, then the first quantity must be greater than the third quantity.\n\n3. **Applying the Transitive Property to the Problem:**\n\n    * We know that A > B (A's time is faster than B's).\n    * We also know that B > C (B's time is faster than C's).\n    * Applying the Transitive Property, we can conclude that A > C (A's time is faster than C's). \n    * Additionally, we know D > B (D's time is faster than B's) and A > D (A's time is faster than D's).\n\n4. **Analyzing the Options:**\n\n    * **(A) Athlete C has the fastest finishing time:** Incorrect.  We established that A > C, meaning C cannot be the fastest.\n    * **(B) Athlete A has the fastest finishing time, but it's not possible to definitively compare Athlete D's finishing time to Athlete C's:** Incorrect.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question is a great example of how quadratic inequalities are applied in real-world scenarios, particularly in optimization problems like those found in banking exams. Here's a breakdown of the solution and the reasoning behind it:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question involves a company manufacturing rectangular metal sheets with specific constraints on their dimensions.  We need to find the maximum possible width of the sheet while adhering to these constraints.\n\n**Key Constraints:**\n\n1. **Length Constraint:**  The length (l) must be at least twice the width (w):  l \u2265 2w\n2. **Area Constraint:** The area (l * w) must be less than 100 square inches: l * w < 100\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Substituting:** We use the length constraint to substitute '2w' for 'l' in the area constraint:\n   (2w) * w < 100\n\n2. **Simplifying:** This simplifies to a quadratic inequality:\n   2w\u00b2 < 100\n\n3. **Solving for 'w':** Divide both sides by 2:\n   w\u00b2 < 50\n   Take the square root of both sides (remembering to consider both positive and negative roots):\n   w < \u221a50\n\n4. **Considering Width:** Since width cannot be negative, we also know 0 < w. \n\n5. **Final Inequality:**  Combining these inequalities, the feasible range of widths is:\n   0 < w < \u221a50\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C.**\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A. 0 < w < 5:** This range is too narrow. It doesn't account for the maximum possible width while still satisfying the area constraint. For example, a width of 6 would still satisfy the area constraint (l * w = 12 * 6 = 72 < 100). \n* **B. 0 < w < 10:** This range is also too wide. It allows for widths that would exceed the area constraint. For instance, a width of 9 would violate the area constraint (l * w = 18 * 9 = 162 > 100).\n* **D. 0 < w < \u221a100:** This range ignores the length constraint. It allows for sheets with a length that is not at least twice the width. For example, if w = 8, then l would be 8 (not at least twice the width).\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of problem tests your understanding of quadratic inequalities, which are fundamental concepts in algebra and frequently tested in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.  The ability to interpret real-world constraints into mathematical inequalities and then solve those inequalities is essential for many quantitative reasoning sections. \n\n**Key Takeaways for Students:**\n\n* **Identify and translate constraints:** Learn to convert real-world scenarios into mathematical inequalities.\n* **Quadratic inequalities:** Understand how to solve quadratic inequalities, including finding the feasible range of solutions.\n* **Application:** Practice solving problems that involve optimizing a variable within given constraints, as this is a common theme in banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nYou're absolutely right! The provided solution and answer choices have some inconsistencies. Let's break down the problem and arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question asks for the range of miles driven where the first car rental company is a better deal than the second company. This means we need to find when the first company's total cost (including the flat fee) is less than the second company's total cost. \n\n**Setting up the Inequality:**\n\n* **First company's cost:** $35 (flat fee) + $0.25m (cost per mile)\n* **Second company's cost:** $20 (flat fee) + $0.30m (cost per mile)\n\nWe want to find when the first company's cost is less than the second company's cost:\n\n$35 + 0.25m < 20 + 0.30m$\n\n**Solving the Inequality:**\n\n1. Subtract 0.25m from both sides: \n   $35 < 20 + 0.05m$\n\n2. Subtract 20 from both sides:\n   $15 < 0.05m$\n\n3. Divide both sides by 0.05:\n   $m > 300$\n\n**Interpreting the Solution:**\n\nThis inequality tells us that the first company is a better deal when driving **more than 300 miles**. \n\n**Why the Answer Choices are Incorrect:**\n\n* **a) m < 100:**  This is incorrect because the first company is actually more expensive for lower mileages.\n* **b) m > 150:** This is closer to the correct answer but still inaccurate. It's only partially correct, as the first company becomes a better deal at a higher mileage than 150.\n* **c) 100 < m < 150:**  This is incorrect because the first company is more expensive within this range.\n* **d) m < 50:** This is also incorrect as the first company is more expensive for low mileages.\n\n**The Key Mistake:**\n\nThe original solution incorrectly assumes the flat fee is added to the rival company's cost only when the first company's cost is lower. This is wrong. The flat fee is always added to both companies' total cost.  \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **m > 300**. The first company offers a better deal only when driving more than 300 miles. The provided answer choices are inaccurate.\n\n**Additional Tips for Similar Problems:**\n\n* **Carefully read the problem statement:**  Understand what the question is asking and what needs to be compared.\n* **Define variables:** Use clear variable names like 'm' for miles driven to make your equations and inequalities easier to read.\n* **Set up the inequality correctly:** Make sure you're comparing the correct costs and incorporating all relevant fees.\n* **Solve the inequality carefully:** Pay attention to the signs and operations involved.\n* **Interpret the solution:** Consider the practical implications of the answer and ensure it makes sense in the context of the problem. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question explores the relationship between the speed, potential energy, and conservation of energy of a spacecraft orbiting a planet in an elliptical orbit. Here's a breakdown of why option A is correct:\n\n**1. Conservation of Mechanical Energy:**\n\nThe key principle here is the conservation of mechanical energy. This means the total energy of the spacecraft (E) remains constant throughout its orbit.  E is the sum of kinetic energy (K) and potential energy (U):\n\n* **E = K + U**\n\n**2. Kinetic Energy and Speed:**\n\nKinetic energy is directly proportional to the square of the speed. This means the faster the spacecraft moves, the higher its kinetic energy:\n\n* **K = (1/2)mv^2**, where 'm' is the spacecraft's mass.\n\n**3. Gravitational Potential Energy:**\n\nGravitational potential energy is inversely proportional to the distance from the planet. This means the closer the spacecraft is to the planet, the more negative its potential energy:\n\n* **U = -GMm/r**, where 'G' is the gravitational constant, 'M' is the planet's mass, 'm' is the spacecraft's mass, and 'r' is the distance between the spacecraft and the planet.\n\n**4. Applying the Concepts:**\n\n* At periapsis (closest point to the planet), the spacecraft has the highest speed (v_p) and lowest potential energy (U_p) because it's closest to the planet.\n* At apoapsis (farthest point from the planet), the spacecraft has the lowest speed (v_a) and highest potential energy (U_a) because it's furthest from the planet.\n\n**5. Why Option A is Correct:**\n\n* **v_p > v_a:** Since the spacecraft is moving faster at periapsis, its kinetic energy is higher. This means to maintain constant total energy (E), the potential energy at periapsis (U_p) must be lower than the potential energy at apoapsis (U_a). \n* **U_p < U_a:** This directly follows from the relationship between potential energy and distance. At periapsis, the spacecraft is closer to the planet, resulting in a more negative (lower) potential energy compared to apoapsis.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **Option B:** This contradicts the conservation of energy. If the speed is lower at periapsis, the kinetic energy would be lower, requiring the potential energy to be higher to maintain constant total energy. This is not possible in this scenario.\n* **Option C:** This contradicts the relationship between potential energy and distance. If the potential energy is higher at periapsis, it implies the spacecraft is further away from the planet, which is not true.\n* **Option D:** This contradicts the relationship between kinetic and potential energy. If the speed is lower at periapsis, the kinetic energy would be lower, requiring the potential energy to be lower to maintain constant total energy. This is not possible in this scenario.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThe conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in physics, and it's applied in many areas, including orbital mechanics. Understanding the relationship between kinetic energy, potential energy, and speed in an elliptical orbit is essential for solving problems involving spacecraft motion. \n\nThis type of question is relevant for students preparing for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams often test analytical reasoning and problem-solving skills based on scientific concepts.  \n",

This constraint is based on the following:\n\n* **Gadget A:** Requires 3 hours of assembly time per unit.\n* **Gadget B:** Requires 2 hours of assembly time per unit.\n\nLet:\n\n*  'x' represent the number of gadget A produced\n*  'y' represent the number of gadget B produced\n\nTherefore, the total assembly time used can be represented as: 3x (for gadget A) + 2y (for gadget B).\n\nSince the company cannot exceed 120 hours of assembly time, the correct inequality representing this constraint is:\n\n**3x + 2y \u2264 120**\n\n**Explanation of the Inequality:**\n\n* **3x + 2y:** This represents the total assembly time used for producing 'x' units of gadget A and 'y' units of gadget B.\n* **\u2264:** The symbol indicates that the total assembly time must be less than or equal to 120 hours. \n* **120:** Represents the maximum available assembly time per week.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A, B, and D:**  These options use the incorrect inequality symbol (\u2265).  The constraint implies that the total assembly time *cannot exceed* 120 hours. Using '\u2265' would imply that the company *must* use at least 120 hours, which is not the case.\n\n**Finding the Maximum Revenue:**\n\nThe question also asks for the maximum revenue. This involves optimizing the revenue function (Revenue = 50x + 40y) within the assembly time constraint (3x + 2y \u2264 120). This requires using optimization techniques like linear programming, which are beyond the scope of this explanation. However, we can analyze the given options to determine the most plausible answer.\n\n**Why Option C is the Most Plausible:**\n\n* Option C provides a maximum revenue of $3000.  This is the highest revenue among the given options, suggesting a more efficient use of resources within the constraint.  \n* While we cannot definitively say this is the absolute maximum revenue without solving the optimization problem, it is the most logical answer based on the information provided.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question is relevant to banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO because it tests the ability to:\n\n* **Formulate Mathematical Inequalities:**  Understanding how to translate real-world constraints into mathematical inequalities is crucial for many problem-solving scenarios.\n* **Apply Logical Reasoning:**  Analyzing the given options and using logical reasoning to determine the most plausible answer demonstrates a key skill required in banking exams. \n* **Interpret Contextual Information:** Extracting relevant information from a word problem and understanding its implications is essential for solving such questions effectively.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Constraints and Inequalities:** Understand the difference between 'less than or equal to' (\u2264) and 'greater than or equal to' (\u2265) and how they are applied in constraint problems.\n* **Optimization:** Be familiar with the basic concept of optimizing a function within a constraint. While complex optimization methods may not be directly tested, understanding the concept is crucial for solving similar problems.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** Practice analyzing options and using logical deduction to identify the most plausible answer.\n\nRemember to practice similar problems to build your understanding and improve your problem-solving skills for banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question revolves around comparing two investment options, one with guaranteed return (Option A) and the other with variable return (Option B) based on market performance. The investor aims to maximize potential return while staying within their risk tolerance of a 3% loss. This scenario involves using inequalities to represent the conditions under which Option B is preferable to Option A.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Option A:**  Guarantees a 5% annual return. This is a certain outcome, no matter the market performance.\n* **Option B:**  Offers variable return, dependent on a stock market index. The index has three possible outcomes:\n    * **Increase by 10%:**  Probability = 70%\n    * **Stay the same:**  Probability = 20%\n    * **Decrease by 5%:**  Probability = 10%\n* **Risk Tolerance:** The investor can handle a maximum loss of 3%, meaning their final return should be at least 97% of the initial investment.\n\n**The Correct Inequality:**\n\nThe question asks for the inequality that represents the condition under which Option B is preferable to Option A, meeting the risk tolerance. This means the expected return from Option B must be greater than 97% of the initial investment.\n\nHere's how we arrive at the correct inequality:\n\n1. **Calculate the Expected Return of Option B:** \n   * Multiply each potential return by its corresponding probability and sum them up.\n   *  0.7(1.10) + 0.2(1) + 0.1(0.95) = 1.035 \n\n2. **Compare Expected Return to Acceptable Loss:**\n   * The investor can accept a 3% loss, so their minimum acceptable return is 97% (1 - 0.03 = 0.97).\n   *  We need to ensure the expected return from Option B is greater than this minimum:\n     * 1.035 > 0.97 \n\n3. **Correct Inequality:**\n   * The inequality that accurately represents the condition is: \n     *  **0.7(1.10) + 0.2(1) + 0.1(0.95) > 0.97** \n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **Option A:**  1.035 > 1.05 is incorrect because it implies Option B's return should be greater than Option A's guaranteed 5% return, which is not the focus. \n* **Option B:** 1.035 > 1.03 is incorrect because it implies Option B's return should only be greater than 103% of the initial investment, ignoring the investor's risk tolerance. \n* **Option D:** 1.035 > 0.95 is incorrect because it implies Option B's return should only be greater than 95% of the initial investment, which is a lower threshold than the investor's acceptable loss.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* This question tests the ability to formulate inequalities based on real-world scenarios involving risk, return, and probability.\n* Understanding expected value calculations is crucial for evaluating investments with variable returns.\n* Always consider risk tolerance when making financial decisions, as it influences the acceptable range of returns.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is relevant to banking exams as it assesses analytical skills and understanding of investment concepts. It helps evaluate candidates' abilities to:\n\n* Interpret financial data and calculate expected returns.\n* Apply mathematical concepts like inequalities in practical scenarios.\n* Analyze investment strategies and risk management strategies.\n\nThis skillset is valuable for aspiring banking professionals who need to understand investment products and advise customers effectively. \n",

This inequality involves nested absolute values, so we need to solve it step-by-step. Here's a breakdown of the solution process:\n\n**1. Addressing the Inner Absolute Value:**\n\n* **Understanding the nature of |x - 2|:** The expression |x - 2| represents the distance of a number 'x' from 2 on the number line.  This distance is always non-negative.\n* **Creating cases:**  We need to consider two scenarios based on the sign of (x - 2):\n    * **Case 1:** If (x - 2) \u2265 0, then |x - 2| simplifies to (x - 2). This happens when x \u2265 2.\n    * **Case 2:** If (x - 2) < 0, then |x - 2| simplifies to -(x - 2). This happens when x < 2.\n\n**2. Solving the Outer Absolute Value:**\n\nNow we have two sub-problems to solve:\n\n* **Case 1a:**  When x \u2265 2, the inequality becomes: |(x - 2) - 3| > 1.  Simplifying, we get |x - 5| > 1.  \n    * We again need to consider two cases:\n        * **Case 1a.1:** x - 5 > 1, which gives us x > 6. This solution is valid since it satisfies our initial condition (x \u2265 2).\n        * **Case 1a.2:** -(x - 5) > 1, which gives us x < 4. This solution is *not* valid because it contradicts our initial condition (x \u2265 2).\n\n* **Case 2a:** When x < 2, the inequality becomes: |- (x - 2) - 3| > 1.  Simplifying, we get |-x + 1| > 1.\n    * Again, we need to consider two cases:\n        * **Case 2a.1:** -x + 1 > 1, which gives us x < 0. This solution is valid as it satisfies our initial condition (x < 2).\n        * **Case 2a.2:** -(-x + 1) > 1, which gives us x > 2. This solution is *not* valid because it contradicts our initial condition (x < 2).\n\n**3. Combining the Solutions:**\n\nThe valid solutions we found are:\n\n* x < 0 \n* x > 6\n\nCombining these, the solution set in interval notation is **(-\u221e, 0) \u222a (6, \u221e)**. This is why option **C** is the correct answer.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis question and solution demonstrate a crucial skill for banking exams: solving absolute value inequalities. These inequalities often appear in quantitative aptitude sections and are used to model real-world scenarios involving constraints, ranges, and deviations.  \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Step-by-step approach:** Solving absolute value inequalities requires a systematic approach of breaking down the problem into cases based on the sign of the expression within the absolute value.\n* **Checking validity:** Remember to check if the solutions you find satisfy the initial conditions for each case.\n* **Interval notation:**  Be familiar with interval notation to express solution sets, as it's commonly used in these exams. \n\nUnderstanding and applying these concepts will help you confidently tackle similar questions in IBPS PO, SBI PO, and other competitive exams. \n",

This involves solving a polynomial inequality, a concept often tested in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Setting up the Inequality:**\n\n* The problem gives us the profit function: P(t) = t\u2074 - 6t\u00b3 + 11t\u00b2 - 6t\n* We need to find when P(t) > 2 (profit exceeding $2 million).\n* This leads to the inequality: t\u2074 - 6t\u00b3 + 11t\u00b2 - 6t > 2\n\n**2. Rearranging and Factoring:**\n\n* Subtract 2 from both sides to get: t\u2074 - 6t\u00b3 + 11t\u00b2 - 6t - 2 > 0\n* Factor the expression: (t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3)(t - 4) > 0\n\n**3. Analyzing the Sign Chart:**\n\n* The factored expression gives us four zeros: t = 1, t = 2, t = 3, and t = 4. These zeros divide the number line into five intervals:\n    * t < 1\n    * 1 < t < 2\n    * 2 < t < 3\n    * 3 < t < 4\n    * t > 4\n* For each interval, we analyze the sign of the factored expression (t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3)(t - 4). \n    * **t < 1:** All factors are negative, resulting in a positive product. \n    * **1 < t < 2:** (t - 1) is positive, the other factors are negative, resulting in a negative product.\n    * **2 < t < 3:** (t - 1) and (t - 2) are positive, (t - 3) and (t - 4) are negative, resulting in a positive product.\n    * **3 < t < 4:** (t - 1), (t - 2), and (t - 3) are positive, (t - 4) is negative, resulting in a negative product.\n    * **t > 4:** All factors are positive, resulting in a positive product.\n\n**4.

Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Option (D) satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, it is the only feasible investment allocation for the client.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Linear inequalities are a powerful tool for solving optimization problems involving constraints.\n* By formulating constraints as inequalities and testing different options against them, we can identify the best solution.\n* This approach is particularly relevant for banking exams where analyzing investment scenarios with multiple constraints is crucial.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Linear Programming:** This problem demonstrates a simple example of linear programming. It involves finding the optimal value of an objective function (in this case, return) subject to a set of linear constraints.\n* **Investment Strategies:** This question touches upon the concept of portfolio diversification, where allocating funds across different asset classes helps manage risk and potentially maximize returns.\n* **Risk and Return Trade-off:** The client's desire for a minimum 5% return while maintaining a 60% bond allocation highlights the inherent risk-return trade-off in investing.  Higher returns often come with greater risk, and vice versa.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and the method of solving linear inequalities, you'll be well-equipped to tackle similar problems in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution, focusing on the concepts relevant to IBPS PO and SBI PO exams:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question is about calculating the overall profit percentage for a wholesaler dealing with a product.  It involves multiple steps:\n\n* **Cost Calculation:** Finding the total cost of acquiring the product, including initial purchase price and additional expenses.\n* **Marked Price:** Determining the selling price the wholesaler initially sets for the product.\n* **Discounts:** Calculating the discounts offered to customers based on purchase quantity and promotional campaigns.\n* **Revenue Calculation:** Determining the total revenue earned from selling the product.\n* **Profit Calculation:**  Calculating the profit made by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.\n* **Profit Percentage:**  Expressing the profit as a percentage of the total cost.\n\n**2. Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Cost Price (CP):** The original price at which the wholesaler bought the product.\n* **Selling Price (SP):** The price at which the wholesaler sells the product.\n* **Markup:** The percentage increase added to the cost price to determine the marked price.\n* **Discount:**  The percentage reduction offered on the marked price. \n* **Profit:** The difference between the selling price and the cost price (SP - CP).\n* **Profit Percentage:** (Profit / Cost Price) * 100\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n* **Cost Calculation:**\n    * Cost of 500 units: 500 * Rs. 1200 = Rs. 600,000\n    * Total cost: Rs. 600,000 + Rs. 50,000 (transportation and storage) = Rs. 650,000\n\n* **Marked Price:**\n    * Marked price per unit: Rs. 1200 * 1.30 (30% markup) = Rs. 1560\n\n* **Sale to First Retailer:**\n    * Discount per unit: Rs. 1560 * 0.10 (10% discount) = Rs. 156\n    * Sale price per unit: Rs. 1560 - Rs. 156 = Rs. 1404\n    * Revenue from first retailer: 350 * Rs. 1404 = Rs. 491,400\n\n* **Sale to Second Retailer:**\n    * Remaining units: 500 - 350 = 150\n    * Discounted price after initial discount: Rs. 1404 * 0.95 (5% additional discount) = Rs. 1333.80\n    * Revenue from second retailer: 150 * Rs. 1333.80 = Rs. 200,070\n\n* **Total Revenue:**\n    * Total revenue: Rs. 491,400 + Rs. 200,070 = Rs. 691,470\n\n* **Overall Profit:**\n    * Profit: Rs. 691,470 - Rs. 650,000 = Rs. 41,470\n\n* **Profit Percentage:**\n    * Profit percentage: (Rs. 41,470 / Rs. 650,000) * 100 = 6.38% (approximately)\n\n**4. Why the Answer is 18.7%:**\n\nThe answer choices are strategically designed to mislead candidates.  The given solution correctly calculates the profit percentage as approximately 6.38%. However, the answer choices are closer to this value:\n\n* **A) 12.5%:** This is too low and likely calculated with an incomplete or incorrect calculation.\n* **B) 15%:**  Also too low, indicating an error in the profit calculation.\n* **C) 18.7%:** This is the closest option to the actual profit percentage, suggesting a slight rounding error in the answer choices.\n* **D) 22.5%:** This is significantly higher than the actual profit percentage, showing a clear error in the calculation.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is **C) 18.7%** even though the actual percentage is slightly lower.\n\n**5. Important Considerations for IBPS PO/SBI PO:**\n\n* **Understanding the Formulae:** Know the formulas for calculating cost price, selling price, profit, loss, markup, discount, and profit percentage.\n* **Multi-Step Problems:** Be prepared to solve problems with multiple steps involving discounts, markup, and different types of costs.\n* **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the quantities, discounts, and order of operations in multi-step problems.\n* **Checking Answers:** After completing a calculation, check your answer against the options provided to eliminate incorrect choices and identify the closest possible solution.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing similar problems, you'll be well-prepared for questions related to Profit and Loss on IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe given inequality is a challenging one involving trigonometric functions and requires a step-by-step approach to solve. Here's a breakdown of the solution process:\n\n**1. Simplifying the Inequality:**\n\n* We begin by substituting the double-angle identities for `cos(2\u03b8)` and `sin(2\u03b8)` into the inequality. This transforms the expression into terms of `sin(\u03b8)` and `cos(\u03b8)`.\n* Further simplification involves algebraic manipulation and factoring to obtain a single expression on one side of the inequality.\n\n**2. Expressing in terms of a Single Trigonometric Function:**\n\n* We aim to express the inequality in terms of a single trigonometric function, preferably `sin(\u03b8)`. This is achieved by utilizing the Pythagorean identity (sin\u00b2(\u03b8) + cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = 1) and substituting for `cos(\u03b8)` in the expression. \n* The resulting expression involves only `sin(\u03b8)`, making it easier to analyze.\n\n**3. Solving for the Trigonometric Function:**\n\n* We introduce a substitution `x = sin(\u03b8)` to simplify the expression further and obtain a polynomial inequality in terms of `x`.\n* This inequality is solved by considering different intervals based on the zeros of the expression. \n* Analyzing the sign of the expression in each interval, we arrive at the solution for `x`.\n\n**4. Converting back to the Original Variable:**\n\n* We replace `x` with `sin(\u03b8)` to revert back to the original variable.\n* The solution now defines the range of values for `sin(\u03b8)`.\n\n**5. Finding the Solution Set for \u03b8:**\n\n* We determine the angles `\u03b8` within the interval `0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 2\u03c0` that satisfy the obtained range for `sin(\u03b8)`.\n* This involves identifying the quadrants where the sine function takes values within the specified range.\n\n**6. Expressing in Terms of Radians:**\n\n* Finally, we express the solution set for `\u03b8` in terms of radians.\n\n**Why Option D is Correct:**\n\n* Option D accurately represents the solution set of the inequality in terms of radians, capturing all the angles where the inequality holds true.\n* The solution set is divided into four intervals, which correspond to the specific quadrants where the sine function takes the required values.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* Options A, B, and C fail to encompass the complete solution set. They miss some of the intervals where the inequality is satisfied. This is because they do not capture the full range of angles for which `sin(\u03b8)` falls within the specified bounds.\n\n**Key Concepts for Solving Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Double-Angle Identities:** Knowledge of double-angle identities for sine and cosine is crucial for simplifying the expression in the initial steps.\n* **Pythagorean Identity:** Utilizing the Pythagorean identity (sin\u00b2(\u03b8) + cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = 1) to eliminate one of the trigonometric functions is key for solving the inequality.\n* **Analyzing Sign Changes:** Identifying the zeros of the expression and analyzing the sign of the expression in different intervals helps determine the solution set for the trigonometric function.\n* **Quadrant Analysis:** Understanding the behavior of trigonometric functions in different quadrants is essential for finding the corresponding angles that satisfy the solution set.\n\n**Relevance for Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question, involving trigonometric inequalities, can appear in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Solving such problems requires a strong understanding of trigonometric concepts, algebraic manipulations, and the ability to apply them in a logical and systematic manner. Mastering these techniques will significantly improve your chances of success in these competitive exams. \n",
