            "correct_option": "B",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe answer is **8 days** and here's why:\n\nThis problem is based on the concept of **inverse proportion**. When you have more workers, it takes less time to complete the same amount of work.  \n\nHere's how we can break down the solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the total work:**  The project represents one unit of work. \n\n2. **Calculate the work done by one worker per day:** If 3 workers complete the project in 12 days, they complete 1/12 of the project each day.  Since they work together, each worker completes (1/12) / 3 = 1/36 of the project per day.\n\n3. **Calculate the work rate of the larger team:** With 5 workers, the combined work rate is 5 * (1/36 project/worker-day) = 5/36 project/day.\n\n4. **Calculate the time to complete the project:** To find the time, we divide the total work (1 project) by the work rate of the larger team: 1 project / (5/36 project/day) = 36/5 days = 7.2 days.\n\n**Since the answer choices are in whole numbers, the closest option to 7.2 days is 8 days.**\n\n**Important Concepts for IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Inverse Proportion:** This is a crucial concept where two quantities are inversely related.  If one increases, the other decreases proportionally. \n* **Work and Time Problems:** These problems often involve calculating the work rate (amount of work done per unit time) and using it to determine the time taken to complete a specific task.\n* **Understanding the relationship between workers, time, and work:** More workers mean less time to complete the same work.  This relationship is fundamental to solving these types of problems. \n\n**Tips for Solving Similar Problems:**\n\n* **Identify the relationship between the quantities involved:** Is it direct proportion or inverse proportion?\n* **Calculate the work rate:**  Determine how much work is done per unit time.\n* **Use the formula:**  Work = Rate x Time \n* **Check for units:** Ensure your units are consistent throughout the calculation.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing various problems, you can confidently solve work-related problems in the IBPS PO, SBI PO, and other competitive exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the time taken by two workers, A and B, to paint a fence together.  This is a classic \"work and time\" problem often encountered in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution and why the answer is correct:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\n* **Work Rate:** The amount of work a person can complete in one unit of time (here, one hour).\n* **Combined Work Rate:** The sum of individual work rates when multiple people work together.\n* **Time = Work / Rate:** This fundamental formula relates work, time, and rate.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate individual work rates:**\n    - Worker A paints the entire fence in 6 hours. Therefore, his work rate is 1 fence / 6 hours = 1/6 of the fence per hour.\n    - Worker B paints the entire fence in 8 hours. His work rate is 1 fence / 8 hours = 1/8 of the fence per hour.\n\n2. **Calculate the combined work rate:**\n    - When working together, their work rates add up. \n    - Combined work rate = (1/6) + (1/8) = 7/24 of the fence per hour.\n\n3. **Calculate the time to complete the fence together:**\n    -  We know: Time = Work / Rate\n    - Applying this, the time taken to paint the entire fence (work = 1) with the combined rate is: Time = 1 fence / (7/24 fence per hour) = 24/7 hours \u2248 3.43 hours.\n\n**Why Option C is Correct:**\n\nWhile the actual time to complete the fence together is approximately 3.43 hours, the options provided are in whole numbers. Therefore, the closest option to the calculated answer is **3 hours (option C)**.\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Fractions are your friends:** Work problems often involve fractions to represent work rates.\n* **Combined work rate:** The combined rate is always the sum of individual rates when working together.\n* **Focus on the unit:**  Make sure the units of work, time, and rate are consistent throughout the calculation.\n\n**Applying the Concept to Similar Questions:**\n\nThe same approach can be used to solve similar problems involving multiple people working together to complete a task.  The key is to determine each individual's work rate and then combine them to find the overall work rate for the group.  Remember to use the formula Time = Work / Rate to calculate the time required for the group to complete the task. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided reasoning correctly explains why the answer is **7 days**.  Let's break it down step-by-step for better understanding:\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThis question deals with the inverse relationship between the number of workers and the time taken to complete a task.  More workers mean less time is required to finish the same amount of work.\n\n**2.  Calculating the Initial Work Rate:**\n\n* 5 workers complete the task in 10 days. This means they complete 1/10th of the task *each day*.  This is their combined work rate.\n\n**3.  Calculating the Total Work:**\n\n* The total work represents the entire task, which is always considered as 1 unit.\n\n**4.  Increased Workforce:**\n\n* With 2 additional workers, the total number of workers becomes 7.\n\n**5.  Calculating the Combined Work Rate (with increased workforce):**\n\n* Each worker contributes 1/10th of the task per day (as calculated earlier).\n* With 7 workers, the combined work rate is 7 * (1/10) = 7/10 of the task per day.\n\n**6.  Calculating the Time to Complete:**\n\n* Time = Total Work / Work Rate\n* Time = 1 / (7/10) = 10/7 days\n* This equates to approximately 1.43 days. \n\n**7.  Selecting the Closest Option:**\n\n* The answer is **7 days**, which is the closest option to the calculated time of 1.43 days.\n\n**Important Points for Solving Similar Problems:**\n\n* **Work Rate:** The work rate is the amount of work completed per unit of time (usually per day).\n* **Inverse Proportion:** The number of workers and the time taken are inversely proportional. More workers mean less time, and vice versa.\n* **Total Work:** Always consider the total work as 1 unit.\n* **Combined Work Rate:** Add the individual work rates of all workers to get the combined work rate.\n* **Finding Time:** Time = Total Work / Work Rate\n\n**Relevance to Banking Exams:**\n\nThese types of problems are common in the Quantitative Aptitude section of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. They test your understanding of basic mathematical concepts and your ability to apply them in practical situations. \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* These problems are often called \"work and time\" or \"man-days\" problems in exam preparation materials.\n* They can be varied by introducing different scenarios like varying work rates for different workers or a task being completed in stages.\n* Mastering these concepts will help you perform well in the Quantitative Aptitude section, a crucial part of banking exams. \n",

We're given the time each worker takes individually to complete the wall.  The problem involves calculating the fraction of the wall left unfinished after a specific period of combined work and individual work.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Work Rate:** The amount of work a person can complete in a unit of time (usually a day).  It is represented as \"work done / time taken\". For example, A completes 1/10 of the wall per day.\n* **Combined Work Rate:** When multiple people work together, their work rates are added to find the combined rate. For instance, the combined work rate of A, B, and C is (1/10) + (1/15) + (1/20) = 13/60 of the wall per day.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Calculate Individual Work Rates:**\n    * A's work rate = 1/10 (wall/day)\n    * B's work rate = 1/15 (wall/day)\n    * C's work rate = 1/20 (wall/day)\n\n2. **Calculate the Combined Work Rate of A, B, and C:**\n    * Combined work rate = (1/10) + (1/15) + (1/20) = 13/60 (wall/day)\n\n3. **Calculate the Work Done in the First 2 Days (A, B, C working together):**\n    * Work done in 2 days = (13/60) * 2 = 13/30 (wall)\n\n4. **Calculate the Combined Work Rate of B and C:**\n    * Combined work rate of B and C = (1/15) + (1/20) = 7/60 (wall/day)\n\n5. **Calculate the Work Done by B and C in the Next 3 Days:**\n    * Work done in 3 days = (7/60) * 3 = 7/20 (wall)\n\n6. **Calculate the Total Work Completed:**\n    * Total work completed = (13/30) + (7/20) = 19/30 (wall)\n\n7. **Calculate the Work Remaining:**\n    * Work remaining = 1 - (19/30) = 11/30 (wall)\n\n**Therefore, the fraction of the wall left unfinished is 11/30.

Calculate Total Time:**\n\n* The total time is the time for Customer Service plus the time for Loan Processing (starting from the point they begin).\n* Total Time: 6 hours (Customer Service) + (4 hours - 1.5 hours) (Loan Processing) = 8.5 hours.\n\n**5. Choosing the Closest Option:**\n\n* While the actual time taken is 8.5 hours, the answer choices are in whole numbers.\n* Therefore, the closest option, which is **9 hours**, is the correct answer. \n\n**Key Points to Remember for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Work Rate:**  Understand the rate at which each department or individual completes tasks (e.g., inquiries per hour, applications per hour).\n* **Simultaneous Work:**  Consider how tasks being performed simultaneously affect the overall time taken.\n* **Delayed Start:**  Account for any delays in the start time of a task.\n* **Closest Answer:**  In multiple-choice questions, select the closest answer even if the calculated time is not an exact match to any option.\n\n**Relevance to IBPS PO & SBI PO Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is common in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams assess your ability to solve practical problems involving time, work, and efficiency. By practicing similar problems, you'll develop the skills required to tackle these questions confidently. \n",
