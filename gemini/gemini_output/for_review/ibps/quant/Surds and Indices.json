            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of how to calculate the standard deviation from the sum of squared deviations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Standard Deviation:**  A measure of how spread out the data points are from the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates a wider spread.\n* **Variance:** The average of the squared deviations from the mean. It is the square of the standard deviation.\n* **Sum of Squared Deviations:** The sum of the squares of the differences between each data point and the mean.\n\n**2. Formulae:**\n\n* **Variance (s\u00b2) = Sum of Squared Deviations / (n - 1)**\n* **Standard Deviation (s) = \u221aVariance**\n\n**3. Applying the Formulae:**\n\n* **Given:**\n    * Sum of Squared Deviations = 64\n    * Number of Data Points (n) = 16\n* **Calculate Variance:**\n    * Variance = 64 / (16 - 1) = 64 / 15\n* **Calculate Standard Deviation:**\n    * Standard Deviation (s) = \u221a(64 / 15) = \u221a(64) / \u221a(15) = 8 / \u221a(15) \n\n**4. Simplifying and Approximating:**\n\nSince none of the options have a denominator of \u221a(15), we need to simplify further:\n\n* Multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a(15): \n    * (8\u221a(15)) / (\u221a(15) * \u221a(15)) = (8\u221a(15)) / 15\n\nNow, the closest option to (8\u221a(15)) / 15 is **2**. This is an approximation as \u221a(15) is slightly greater than 3.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is A (2).**\n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* Understand the relationship between standard deviation, variance, and the sum of squared deviations.\n* Know how to calculate these measures using the appropriate formulae.\n* Be prepared to simplify and approximate answers, especially when dealing with surds (irrational numbers).\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This question is a good example of how surds and indices are used in statistical calculations. \n* It's important to remember that the standard deviation is a measure of dispersion, which is a key concept in descriptive statistics.\n\n**Practice Tip:**\n\nTo solidify your understanding, try working through similar problems with different sets of data and practice simplifying expressions involving surds.",

This is a common topic in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Simplify the given equation:** \n   * (a^3)^1/4 = 16 \n   * Using the index rule (a^m)^n = a^(m*n), we get:  a^(3/4) = 16\n\n2. **Rewrite 16 in terms of a base:**\n   * 16 can be expressed as 2^4\n   * Our equation now becomes: a^(3/4) = 2^4\n\n3. **Equate the exponents:**\n   * To solve for 'a', we need to make the exponents on both sides of the equation equal.\n   * Raise both sides of the equation to the power of 4/3: \n     * (a^(3/4))^(4/3) = (2^4)^(4/3)\n     * This results in: a = 2^(16/3)\n\n4. **Substitute 'a' in the expression (a^2)^1/3:**\n   * Substitute the value of 'a' we found: (2^(16/3))^2 * (1/3)\n\n5. **Apply the index rule again:**\n   * (a^m)^n = a^(m*n)\n   * This gives us: 2^(16/3 * 2 * 1/3) = 2^(32/9)\n\n6. **Simplify the exponent:**\n   * 2^(32/9) can be simplified to 2^(3 + 5/9)\n   * This is the same as: 2^3 * 2^(5/9) = 8 * 2^(5/9)\n\n7. **Identify the closest option:**\n   * The closest option to 8 * 2^(5/9) is **32**. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is option (C) 32.**\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding index rules:** This question heavily relies on the ability to manipulate exponents using rules like (a^m)^n = a^(m*n).\n* **Simplifying expressions:**  Practice breaking down complex expressions and using the right index rules to simplify them.\n* **Approximating values:** In some cases, you may need to estimate the value of an expression.
