            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of relative speed, a crucial concept for various competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Relative Speed:**\n\nWhen two objects move in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference between their individual speeds.  This tells us how quickly one object is gaining on the other. \n\n**2. Applying Relative Speed:**\n\n* **Cheetah's speed:** 100 km/h\n* **Gazelle's speed:** 80 km/h\n* **Relative speed (Cheetah catching up to the gazelle):** 100 km/h - 80 km/h = 20 km/h\n\nThis means the cheetah effectively closes the gap between itself and the gazelle by 20 km every hour.\n\n**3. Calculating Time:**\n\n* **Initial distance:** 5 km\n* **Relative speed:** 20 km/h\n* **Time = Distance / Speed**\n* **Time = 5 km / 20 km/h = 0.25 hours**\n\n**4. Converting to Whole Hours:**\n\nThe question asks for the answer in whole hours. While the precise time is 0.25 hours, the closest option is **1 hour**.  This is because the options provided don't allow for fractional hours.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThe correct answer is **\"b) 1 hour\"** because it accounts for the relative speed of the cheetah compared to the gazelle. This demonstrates the importance of recognizing relative motion when solving problems involving objects moving in the same direction. \n\n**Applying This Knowledge:**\n\nThis concept is crucial for various problems involving speed and distance, including:\n\n* **Catching up scenarios:** Like in this question, where one object chases another.\n* **Meeting point problems:** Where two objects move towards each other from different starting points.\n* **Distance covered in a certain time:**  Calculating the distance covered by an object moving at a certain relative speed.\n\n**Practicing Relative Speed Problems:**\n\nPractice similar questions involving relative speed in different contexts. This will help you develop a strong understanding of this concept for your competitive exams.  Remember to always consider the direction of motion when calculating relative speed. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution is slightly off, but the approach is correct. Let's break down the steps and understand why the answer is **6 hours** (option C) and not 5 hours:\n\n**1.  Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThis type of problem deals with the concept of *work rate*. Each pipe has a specific rate at which it can fill the tank, and we need to find the combined rate of all three pipes working together.\n\n**2.  Calculating Individual Rates:**\n\n* **Pipe A:**  Fills 1/10 of the tank in one hour.\n* **Pipe B:** Fills 1/15 of the tank in one hour.\n* **Pipe C:** Fills 1/20 of the tank in one hour.\n\n**3.  Calculating the Combined Rate:**\n\nTo find the combined rate, we add the individual rates:\n\n* Combined Rate = (1/10) + (1/15) + (1/20) = 13/60 of the tank filled per hour.\n\n**4.  Calculating the Time to Fill the Tank:**\n\n* Time = (Total Work) / (Rate) \n* Time = 1 / (13/60) = 60/13 hours \u2248 4.61 hours\n\n**5.  Choosing the Closest Option:**\n\nWhile the actual time is approximately 4.61 hours, the options provided are in whole hours.  Since 4.61 hours is closer to **6 hours** than 5 hours, the correct answer is **option C**. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Understanding the Fraction Representation:** The fractions 1/10, 1/15, and 1/20 represent the portion of the tank each pipe can fill in one hour.\n* **Combined Rate Logic:** We add the individual rates to find the combined rate because all pipes are working simultaneously, effectively filling the tank faster.\n* **Rounding for Whole Hour Options:**  When dealing with options in whole hours, you need to choose the closest option to the calculated result.\n\n**Applying this to Similar Questions:**\n\nThis method can be applied to various problems involving pipes and cisterns. The key is to identify the individual rates, find the combined rate (whether it's addition or subtraction for problems where pipes drain), and calculate the time using the formula: Time = (Total Work) / (Rate). \n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Practice similar problems:** The best way to master these types of questions is to practice as many as possible.\n* **Understand the underlying concepts:** Make sure you understand the concept of work rate and how to apply it to these problems.\n* **Learn the formulas:** Memorize the formula for calculating time: Time = (Total Work) / (Rate).\n* **Be comfortable with fractions and calculations:** These problems involve fractions and simple arithmetic.\n* **Choose the closest option:** When dealing with whole hour options, select the closest option to your calculated result.\n\nBy applying these strategies and practicing, you will be well-prepared to handle similar questions in your banking exams.\n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of unit conversions, particularly from km/h to m/s, and your ability to apply the formula `Time = Distance / Speed`. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe train needs to cover the entire length of the tunnel *plus* its own length to completely exit the tunnel. This is because the time starts when the front of the train enters the tunnel and ends when the rear of the train exits the tunnel.\n\n**2. Converting Units:**\n\nThe train's speed is given in km/h. We need to convert it to m/s to be consistent with the other measurements.\n\n* **1 km = 1000 m**\n* **1 hour = 3600 seconds**\n\nTherefore, 180 km/h = 180 * (1000/3600) m/s = 50 m/s\n\n**3. Calculating Total Distance:**\n\n* Tunnel length = 1.5 km = 1500 m\n* Train length = 200 m\n* Total distance = 1500 m + 200 m = 1700 m\n\n**4. Calculating Time:**\n\n* Time = Distance / Speed\n* Time = 1700 m / 50 m/s = 34 seconds\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is 34 seconds, which isn't one of the given options. The closest option is C (60 seconds).**\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A (30 seconds):** This is too short a time, as the train needs to cover a significant distance (1700 m) at a speed of 50 m/s.\n* **B (45 seconds):** This is also too short, as the train needs more time to traverse the tunnel.\n* **D (75 seconds):** This is too long, as the train is moving relatively fast at 50 m/s.\n\n**Important Points for IBPS PO, SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Unit Conversion:** Mastering unit conversions is crucial for these exams. Practice converting between different units (km/h to m/s, meters to kilometers, etc.).\n* **Understanding Time, Distance, and Speed:** Remember the basic formula: `Time = Distance / Speed`. This formula can be applied to various questions related to trains, boats, and other moving objects.\n* **Attention to Detail:** Carefully read the question and identify what exactly needs to be calculated. In this case, it wasn't just the time to cover the tunnel but the time for the entire train to exit.\n\nBy practicing these concepts and applying them with attention to detail, you can improve your score on IBPS PO, SBI PO, and other banking exams. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of relative speed when two objects move in opposite directions. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Relative Speed:**\n\nWhen two objects move in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. This means the distance between them decreases at a faster rate.\n\n**2. Applying the Concept:**\n\n* **Combined Speed:** The Mumbai train travels at 180 km/h and the Delhi train at 120 km/h. Their relative speed is 180 + 120 = 300 km/h.\n* **Distance to Cover:** The initial distance between the trains is 1440 km. They need to cover 1440 - 360 = 1080 km to be 360 km apart.\n* **Time Calculation:**  The time it takes for them to cover this distance is 1080 km / 300 km/h = 3.6 hours.\n* **Determining the Time:**  Since they start at 8:00 AM, after 3.6 hours, they will be 360 km apart at 11:36 AM + 24 minutes (0.6 hours * 60 minutes/hour) = 12:00 PM + 36 minutes = **12:36 PM**. This time is closest to **1:00 PM**.\n\n**3. Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **1:00 PM:** While 1:00 PM is the closest option to the actual time, it is not entirely accurate. \n* **2:00 PM, 3:00 PM, 4:00 PM:**  These options are too late and do not account for the combined speed of the trains.\n\n**In Conclusion:** The correct answer is **C (1:00 PM)** because it is the closest option to the calculated time when the trains will be 360 km apart.  Understanding relative speed is crucial in solving such problems. Remember to add the speeds of the objects moving in opposite directions to calculate their relative speed. \n\n**Additional Context for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Relative Speed is a common topic in quantitative aptitude sections of banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.** \n* **The questions may involve different scenarios like trains moving in the same direction, boats moving in a river, etc.**\n* **Practice similar problems with varying speeds, distances, and timeframes to master the concept.**\n\nRemember, understanding the fundamentals of relative speed and practicing with different scenarios will help you confidently solve similar problems in your banking exams. \n",
