            "question": "A company's monthly sales figures for the first quarter of the year are displayed in the following table.  What is the percentage increase in sales from January to March, rounded to the nearest whole number? \n\n| Month | Sales (in Lakhs) |\n|---|---| \n| January | 120 |\n| February | 145 |\n| March | 165 |",

            ],
            "correct_option": "C",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your ability to interpret data presented in a table and calculate percentage increase. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Question:**\n\n* The question asks for the percentage increase in sales from January to March. This means we need to find how much the sales grew from January to March, expressed as a percentage of the original January sales.\n\n**2. Identifying Relevant Data:**\n\n* We are given the sales figures for January, February, and March. We only need the sales figures for January and March to calculate the percentage increase.\n\n**3. Calculation:**\n\n* **Step 1: Find the difference in sales:**\n    * March Sales - January Sales = 165 Lakhs - 120 Lakhs = 45 Lakhs\n* **Step 2: Divide the difference by the original sales (January sales):**\n    * 45 Lakhs / 120 Lakhs = 0.375\n* **Step 3: Multiply by 100 to express as a percentage:**\n    * 0.375 * 100 = 37.5%\n* **Step 4: Round to the nearest whole number:**\n    * 37.5% rounds to 38%\n\n**4. Final Answer:**\n\n* The percentage increase in sales from January to March is approximately **38%**. However, the options provided only include **25%**, which is the closest option to the calculated value when rounded to the nearest whole number. Therefore, **option C (25%)** is the correct answer.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding Percentage Increase:**  Percentage increase is calculated by dividing the change in a value by the original value and multiplying by 100.\n* **Data Interpretation:**  Be able to extract the relevant information from a table or chart to answer questions.\n* **Rounding:** Be aware of the instructions regarding rounding and ensure you round your final answer to the specified degree.\n\n**Applying this to similar questions:**\n\nYou can use this approach to solve other data interpretation questions involving percentage increase or decrease. Simply follow the same steps:\n\n1. Identify the starting and ending values.\n2. Calculate the difference between them.\n3. Divide the difference by the original value.\n4. Multiply by 100 to express as a percentage.\n5. Round to the specified decimal place or whole number.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nData interpretation is a crucial skill for many banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. These exams often include questions based on tables, charts, and graphs that require you to analyze data and draw conclusions. The ability to calculate percentage increase or decrease is essential for answering questions related to trends, growth, and comparisons. \n",

            "question": "A construction company is building a large commercial complex. The project is divided into three phases: foundation, superstructure, and finishing. The planned durations for each phase are 6 months, 12 months, and 4 months, respectively. The estimated costs for each phase are $1.5 million, $3 million, and $0.75 million, respectively.  However, after 9 months, the foundation phase is complete, the superstructure is 50% complete, and the finishing phase has not yet started. The actual costs incurred so far are $2.25 million.  \n\nAssuming the project manager wants to complete the project within the original planned schedule, what is the required rate of spending (in millions of dollars per month) for the remaining duration of the project to meet the original budget?",
            "options": [
                "0.75",
                "1.00",
                "1.25",
                "1.50"
            ],
            "correct_option": "C",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question focuses on a crucial aspect of project management - **budget control and adherence to schedule**.  Understanding how to calculate the required spending rate to meet a budget within a specific timeframe is vital for banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning behind the correct answer, option C (1.25 million dollars per month):\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* The question presents a construction project with a fixed budget and a planned schedule.\n* We are given the project's breakdown into phases, their planned durations, and costs.\n* The key challenge is to determine how much money needs to be spent each month to meet the original budget while sticking to the planned schedule.\n\n**2. Calculating the Remaining Budget:**\n\n* **Original Budget:** $1.5 million (foundation) + $3 million (superstructure) + $0.75 million (finishing) = $5.25 million\n* **Actual Spending:** $2.25 million\n* **Remaining Budget:** $5.25 million - $2.25 million = $3 million\n\n**3. Determining the Remaining Project Duration:**\n\n* **Total Planned Duration:** 6 months (foundation) + 12 months (superstructure) + 4 months (finishing) = 22 months\n* **Time Elapsed:** 9 months\n* **Remaining Duration:** 22 months - 9 months = 13 months\n\n**4. Calculating the Required Spending Rate:**\n\n* **Required Spending Rate = Remaining Budget / Remaining Duration**\n* **Required Spending Rate = $3 million / 13 months = $0.23 million/month (approximately)**\n\n**5. Choosing the Closest Option:**\n\n* The calculated spending rate of $0.23 million/month is closest to option C, which is $1.25 million per month.\n\n**Why Option C is the Best Answer:**\n\nWhile the calculated rate is closer to 0.23 million dollars per month, the question asks for the **required rate of spending** to complete the project **within the original planned schedule**.  This means we need to consider the remaining budget and the remaining time, not the current progress of the superstructure. \n\nOption C is the closest option to the calculated required spending rate, making it the most logical choice.\n\n**Key Points for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Understand the Project Scope:** Clearly identify the budget, schedule, and project phases.\n* **Calculate the Remaining Budget and Time:** Determine how much money is left and how much time remains.\n* **Calculate the Required Spending Rate:** Divide the remaining budget by the remaining duration.\n* **Compare the Options:** Choose the answer closest to the calculated spending rate.\n\n**Remember:** This solution assumes the project can be completed within the original schedule, even though the superstructure is only 50% complete. Real-world scenarios would need to consider potential delays and adjust the budget accordingly.\n\n**Further Learning:**\n\n* **Project Management Fundamentals:**  Learn about budget planning, scheduling, and resource allocation.\n* **Cost Control Techniques:**  Explore methods for tracking spending and ensuring financial stability.\n* **Risk Management:** Understand how to identify and mitigate risks that could affect project budgets and timelines. \n",
