            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe reasoning provided in the question is partially correct but contains a crucial error in the final calculation. Let's break down the steps and identify the mistake:\n\n**1. Finding the Radius:**\n\n* The radius of the sphere is correctly calculated as half the diameter: \n   radius = diameter / 2 = 12 meters / 2 = 6 meters\n\n**2. Calculating the Surface Area:**\n\n* The formula for the surface area of a sphere is correctly used:\n   surface area = 4\u03c0r\u00b2 = 4 * 3.14 * (6 meters)\u00b2 = 452.16 square meters\n\n**3. Determining the Paint Required:**\n\n* This is where the error occurs. The reasoning states that 452.16 square meters / 10 square meters/liter = 45.22 liters. However, this calculation is incorrect. \n* **We need to divide the total surface area by the coverage per liter to find the required liters of paint.** This means the correct calculation is: 452.16 square meters / 10 square meters/liter = **45.216 liters**. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer should be 45.22 liters**, which is not provided as an option. The closest option available is 135.66 liters, which is **incorrect** and a result of a rounding error.\n\n**Important Points for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Formulas:**  Know the formulas for calculating surface area of spheres, cylinders, cones, etc. These are frequently tested in banking exams.\n* **Careful Calculations:**  Pay close attention to units and perform calculations accurately. A small mistake can lead to a wrong answer.\n* **Rounding and Approximation:** Be mindful of rounding instructions and the level of precision required.  In this case, the final answer should have been rounded to two decimal places, resulting in 45.22 liters.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* This question is a classic example of how to apply geometry concepts to practical situations.\n* Banking exams often test these types of problem-solving skills, requiring candidates to understand the concepts and apply them in different contexts. \n* Practicing similar questions with varying dimensions and scenarios will help you master these skills.\n\nBy understanding the concepts of surface area, carefully performing calculations, and paying attention to rounding, you can ace these types of questions in your banking exams! \n",

            "question": "Consider the circle defined by the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 6x + 4y - 12 = 0. Find the equation of the normal line to this circle at the point (7, 1). What is the x-intercept of this normal line?",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThe question asks us to find the equation of the normal line to a circle at a given point and then determine its x-intercept. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Finding the Center and Radius of the Circle:**\n\nThe equation of the circle is given as: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 6x + 4y - 12 = 0. To find the center and radius, we need to rewrite this equation in standard form: (x - h)\u00b2 + (y - k)\u00b2 = r\u00b2, where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius.\n\n* **Completing the square:**\n    * Group the x and y terms: (x\u00b2 - 6x) + (y\u00b2 + 4y) = 12\n    * Complete the square for x: (x\u00b2 - 6x + 9) + (y\u00b2 + 4y) = 12 + 9\n    * Complete the square for y: (x\u00b2 - 6x + 9) + (y\u00b2 + 4y + 4) = 12 + 9 + 4\n    * Rewrite in standard form: (x - 3)\u00b2 + (y + 2)\u00b2 = 25\n\n* **Identifying the center and radius:** Now we can see that the center of the circle is (h, k) = (3, -2) and the radius is r = \u221a25 = 5.\n\n**2. Finding the Slope of the Tangent:**\n\nThe tangent line at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to that point. We are given the point (7, 1) on the circle. \n\n* **Slope of the radius:** The slope of the radius connecting the center (3, -2) and the point (7, 1) is: (1 - (-2))/(7 - 3) = 3/4.\n\n* **Slope of the tangent:** Since the tangent is perpendicular to the radius, its slope is the negative reciprocal of the radius's slope. Therefore, the slope of the tangent line is -4/3.\n\n**3. Finding the Slope of the Normal:**\n\nThe normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line. Therefore, its slope is the negative reciprocal of the tangent line's slope. This means the slope of the normal line is 3/4.\n\n**4. Finding the Equation of the Normal Line:**\n\nWe can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the normal line. We have the point (7, 1) and the slope 3/4. \n\n* **Point-slope form:**  y - y\u2081 = m(x - x\u2081)\n* **Substituting:** y - 1 = (3/4)(x - 7)\n* **Simplifying:** y = (3/4)x - 17/4\n\n**5. Finding the x-intercept:**\n\nThe x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis, meaning y = 0.\n\n* **Setting y = 0:** 0 = (3/4)x - 17/4\n* **Solving for x:** (3/4)x = 17/4 \n* **Simplifying:** x = 17/3 \n\n**Therefore, the x-intercept of the normal line is 17/3, which is approximately 5.67. Since the closest option provided is 6, the correct answer is d) 8.**\n\n**Additional Context for Banking Exams:**\n\nThis type of question is common in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO because it tests your understanding of basic geometry and algebra, which are essential for problem-solving in finance. \n\n* **Key takeaways:**\n    * Be familiar with the standard equation of a circle and how to complete the square to find its center and radius.\n    * Understand the relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines (negative reciprocals).\n    * Be comfortable with using point-slope form to find the equation of a line.\n    * Remember that the x-intercept is found by setting y = 0 and solving for x.\n\nPractice similar problems with different circles and points to solidify your understanding.

            "question": "An elliptical mirror is designed such that the distance from any point on the mirror's surface to one focus is always 10 cm less than the distance to the other focus.  The distance between the two foci is 24 cm. A light source is placed at one focus.  If the light beam reflects off the mirror and travels to the other focus, what is the total distance the light beam travels?",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question focuses on the defining property of an ellipse: **the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant.**  Let's break down the solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We are given an elliptical mirror with two foci (points of focus).\n   - The distance between the two foci is 24 cm.\n   - A light source is placed at one focus.\n   - The light reflects off the mirror and reaches the other focus.\n   - We need to find the total distance the light beam travels.\n\n2. **Applying the Ellipse Property:**\n   - Let's consider a point 'P' on the mirror's surface.\n   - Let the distance from 'P' to one focus (where the light source is) be 'x' cm.\n   - The distance from 'P' to the other focus is 'x + 10' cm (given in the question).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   - According to the ellipse property, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant.\n   - This constant value is equal to the distance between the two foci (24 cm). \n   - Therefore, we can write the equation: x + (x + 10) = 24\n\n4. **Solving for 'x':**\n   - Combining like terms, we get: 2x + 10 = 24\n   - Subtracting 10 from both sides: 2x = 14\n   - Dividing both sides by 2: x = 7\n\n5. **Calculating the Total Distance:**\n   - The light travels from the light source (one focus) to the mirror's surface (point 'P') and then to the other focus.\n   - So, the total distance traveled is: x + (x + 10) = 7 + (7 + 10) = 24 cm.\n   - Since the light travels twice this distance (to and from the mirror), the total distance is 2 * 24 cm = 48 cm.\n\n6. **Analyzing the Options:**\n   - The closest option to the calculated distance (48 cm) is 44 cm. However, the provided reasoning in the question is incorrect and leads to a wrong calculation (68 cm). \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer should be 44 cm, not 64 cm. The reasoning provided in the question is flawed and leads to an incorrect calculation.**\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n- Understand the defining property of an ellipse related to its foci.\n- Be able to apply this property to solve problems involving distances and reflections.\n- Develop strong problem-solving skills to set up and solve equations based on the given information.\n- Pay close attention to the details and avoid common errors in calculations. \n- Practice similar questions to improve your understanding and confidence. \n",
