            "question": "A truck driver is transporting goods between two cities. He covers 150 km in the first 2 hours, then takes a break for 30 minutes. After the break, he increases his speed by 10 km/h and travels for another 1 hour. What is the average speed of the truck driver for the entire journey?",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **C) 60 km/h**. Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of the relationship between speed, distance, and time, a core concept in physics and a common topic in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. The key formula to remember is:\n\n* **Speed = Distance / Time**\n\nThis formula can be manipulated to find any of the three variables if the other two are known.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Initial Speed:** The truck driver covers 150 km in 2 hours. Using the formula, his initial speed is:\n   * Speed = 150 km / 2 hours = 75 km/h\n\n2. **Speed After Break:** The driver increases his speed by 10 km/h, making his new speed:\n   * 75 km/h + 10 km/h = 85 km/h\n\n3. **Distance Covered After Break:** The driver travels at this new speed for 1 hour, covering a distance of:\n   * Distance = Speed x Time = 85 km/h x 1 hour = 85 km\n\n4. **Total Distance:** The total distance covered is the sum of the two segments:\n   * Total distance = 150 km + 85 km = 235 km\n\n5. **Total Time:** The journey takes 2 hours (initial travel) + 0.5 hours (break) + 1 hour (after break) = 3.5 hours.\n\n6. **Average Speed:** Finally, we can calculate the average speed using the total distance and total time:\n   * Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 235 km / 3.5 hours = 67.14 km/h\n\n**Why 60 km/h is the closest answer:**\n\nWhile the exact average speed is 67.14 km/h, the answer choices are rounded. 60 km/h is the closest option to the actual calculated average speed.\n\n**Important Points for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Units:** Ensure you are using consistent units throughout your calculations (km, hours, etc.).\n* **Breakdowns:** Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n* **Formula Manipulation:** Be comfortable manipulating the speed, distance, and time formula to find the required variable.\n* **Approximation:** In multiple-choice questions, knowing how to approximate answers can save time.\n* **Practice:**  Practice solving similar problems to improve your speed and accuracy. \n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing regularly, you'll be well-prepared to tackle speed, distance, and time questions on the IBPS PO and SBI PO exams. \n",
