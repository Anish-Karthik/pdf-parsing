            "question": "A small town has two main industries: Farming and Manufacturing. Farming relies heavily on inputs from Manufacturing (for tools and equipment), while Manufacturing uses inputs from Farming (for agricultural products). The following table shows the inter-industry transactions in millions of dollars:\n\n| Industry | Farming Output | Manufacturing Output | Final Demand | Total Output |\n|---|---|---|---|---| \n| Farming | 10 | 20 | 30 | 60 |\n| Manufacturing | 30 | 15 | 45 | 90 |\n\nIf the final demand for Manufacturing products increases by $10 million, what is the estimated total increase in output for Manufacturing, taking into account the multiplier effect?",
            "options": [
                "$10 million",
                "$12.5 million",
                "$15 million",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of the **input-output model** in economics, which is a fundamental concept relevant to banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. This model helps analyze the inter-relationships between different industries within an economy and how changes in one industry can impact others. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Table:**\n\nThe table shows the inter-industry transactions in a town with two industries: Farming and Manufacturing. The table is organized as follows:\n\n* **Industry:** This column lists the two industries: Farming and Manufacturing.\n* **Farming Output:** This column represents the amount of output (in millions of dollars) produced by the Farming industry that goes to:\n    * **Farming Output:**  Internal consumption within the Farming industry.\n    * **Manufacturing Output:** Output used by the Manufacturing industry as input.\n    * **Final Demand:** Output sold directly to consumers (not used by other industries).\n    * **Total Output:** Sum of the above three columns.\n* **Manufacturing Output:** This column follows the same logic as the \"Farming Output\" column, representing the output produced by the Manufacturing industry. \n\n**2. Direct and Indirect Requirements:**\n\n* **Direct Requirement:** When the final demand for Manufacturing products increases by $10 million, the Manufacturing industry directly requires an additional $10 million worth of input.\n* **Indirect Requirement:**  This refers to the additional input required by the Manufacturing industry due to increased production in the Farming industry, which is itself driven by the increased demand for Manufacturing output.\n\n**3. Calculating the Multiplier:**\n\nThe multiplier effect highlights how an initial change in spending (in this case, $10 million increase in final demand for Manufacturing) can lead to a larger overall increase in economic activity. Here's how we calculate the multiplier:\n\n* **Direct Input Coefficient (for Manufacturing):**  This is the proportion of Manufacturing output that goes towards its own production. It's calculated as: (Manufacturing output used by Manufacturing) / (Total Manufacturing output) = 15/90 = 0.15\n* **Indirect Input Coefficient (for Manufacturing):** This represents the proportion of Farming output that goes towards Manufacturing production. It's calculated as: (Farming output used by Manufacturing) / (Total Manufacturing output) = 30/90 = 0.33\n* **Total Input Coefficient:** This is the sum of direct and indirect input coefficients: 0.15 + 0.33 = 0.48\n* **Multiplier:**  The multiplier is calculated as: 1 / (1 - Total Input Coefficient) = 1 / (1 - 0.48) = 1.92\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Increase in Manufacturing Output:**\n\nThe total increase in Manufacturing output is calculated by multiplying the initial increase in final demand by the multiplier:\n\n* **Total increase in Manufacturing output:** $10 million * 1.92 = $19.2 million\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the exact answer is $19.2 million, the closest option provided is **(C) $15 million**. This emphasizes the importance of the multiplier effect: a small increase in final demand leads to a larger increase in overall output.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Input-Output Analysis:** This is a powerful tool for analyzing the interconnectedness of industries and their dependence on each other. It's widely used in economic planning, forecasting, and understanding the impact of government policies.\n* **Importance for Banking Exams:** Understanding the input-output model helps you analyze economic scenarios, understand how changes in one sector can impact others, and assess the overall health of the economy. This knowledge is crucial for banking professionals who need to make informed decisions about lending, investment, and economic forecasting. \n\nBy mastering the input-output model and understanding its application, you'll be well-equipped to answer similar questions and excel in your banking exam preparation. \n",

            "question": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B, using three resources: Labor, Raw Materials, and Machinery. The following table shows the input-output coefficients for each product:\n\n| Resource | Product A | Product B |\n|---|---|---| \n| Labor (hours per unit) | 3 | 2 |\n| Raw Materials (kg per unit) | 5 | 4 |\n| Machinery (machine hours per unit) | 1 | 2 |\n\nThe company has 1200 hours of labor available, 2500 kg of raw materials, and 500 machine hours. If the company wants to maximize its profit, how many units of Product A should it produce given that the profit margin for Product A is $20 per unit and for Product B is $30 per unit?",
            "options": [
                "200 units",
                "250 units",
                "300 units",
                "350 units"
            ],
            "correct_option": "C",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your ability to analyze input-output relationships, apply resource constraints, and make strategic production decisions to maximize profit. Here's a breakdown of the solution and why the answer is **(c) 300 units**:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* The company faces limitations in labor, raw materials, and machinery.\n* Each product requires specific quantities of each resource.\n* Profit is generated based on the number of units produced for each product.\n* The goal is to find the optimal production mix of Products A and B that maximizes profit while respecting resource constraints.\n\n**2.  Setting up the Constraints:**\n\n* **Labor:** 3A + 2B \u2264 1200 (where A is units of Product A and B is units of Product B)\n* **Raw Materials:** 5A + 4B \u2264 2500\n* **Machinery:** A + 2B \u2264 500\n\n**3. Maximizing Profit:**\n\n* **Profit Function:** Profit = 20A + 30B\n* **Prioritizing High Profit per Resource:** The question emphasizes a simple, intuitive approach for a medium-difficulty exam question. We need to consider which product generates the most profit per unit of the most limiting resource. In this case, **labor** is the most restrictive resource. \n* **Product B's Advantage:** Product B yields a higher profit per labor hour ($30/2 = $15) compared to Product A ($20/3 = $6.67).  Therefore, we should prioritize producing as many units of Product B as possible within the labor constraint.\n* **Maximizing B, then A:**\n    * With 1200 labor hours, we can produce a maximum of 1200/2 = 600 units of Product B.\n    * However, this would require 600 * 4 = 2400 kg of raw materials and 600 * 2 = 1200 machine hours, exceeding our available resources.\n* **Adjusting Production:** We need to adjust the production of Product B to use all available resources effectively. \n    * Producing 500 units of Product B fully utilizes the available machine hours (500 * 2 = 1000 hours).\n    * This leaves 1000 labor hours (1200 - 500 * 2), which can be used to produce 1000/3 = 333.33 units of Product A. \n\n**4. Choosing the Correct Answer:**\n\n* Since we cannot produce fractional units, the maximum production of Product A is 333 units.\n* The closest option to this is **(c) 300 units**. \n\n**5.  Understanding the Limitation of the Approach:**\n\nWhile this approach provides a good approximation for a medium-difficulty exam question, a more precise solution using **linear programming** would give a slightly higher profit by finding the exact optimal values of A and B. \n\n**Key Takeaways for IBPS PO/SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* Understand the relationship between resources, production, and profit.\n* Identify the most limiting resource and prioritize production based on profit per unit of that resource.\n* Use a simple approach for medium-difficulty questions and be aware of its limitations. \n\nThis explanation helps you understand the problem-solving process in analyzing input-output relationships and applying resource constraints to maximize profit, a common concept tested in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO.\n",
