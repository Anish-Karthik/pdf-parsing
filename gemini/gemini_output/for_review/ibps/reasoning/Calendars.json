            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your ability to understand and calculate dates based on calendar information. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identifying the Second Monday of February:**  We need to find the second Monday in February.  Since February has 28 days in a non-leap year, the second Monday falls on the 13th.\n\n2. **Determining the Third Friday of March:**  We need to find the third Friday in March.  March has 31 days.  The first Friday is on the 3rd, the second Friday is on the 10th, and the third Friday falls on the 17th.\n\n3. **One Week Before the Third Friday:**  The question asks for the last day of the conference, which is *exactly one week before* the third Friday of March (March 17th). This date is March 10th.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Options:** The question provides options for the last day of the conference, and none of them are March 10th.  The closest option to March 10th is **March 16th**, which is the Friday following March 10th.\n\n**Therefore, the closest correct option is C (March 16th), even though the exact date of the last day of the conference should be March 10th.**\n\n**Key Concepts for Solving Calendar-Based Problems:**\n\n* **Understanding Calendar Structure:**  Be familiar with the number of days in each month, leap years, and the order of days in a week.\n* **Counting Days:**  Practice calculating the number of days between two given dates.\n* **Identifying Weekdays:**  Be able to determine the weekday for a specific date.\n* **Relating Dates and Weekdays:**  Understand the relationship between dates and days of the week (e.g., if a specific day falls on a Monday, you can easily determine the day of the week for dates before or after).\n\n**Applying the Concepts in Similar Questions:**\n\nMany questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO involve calendar-based reasoning. These questions might test your ability to:\n\n* Determine the day of the week for a given date.\n* Find a date that is a specific number of days before or after a given date.\n* Calculate the number of days between two dates.\n* Solve problems involving specific calendar events (e.g., holidays, festivals).\n\nBy understanding the key concepts explained above and practicing with similar questions, you can effectively tackle these types of questions on your banking exams. \n",
