            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of **work and time** relationships, a common topic in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Work Rate:**\n\n* **Work rate** is the amount of work done per unit of time. \n* In this case, the 'work' is completing the project, and the 'time' is measured in days.\n\n**2. Calculating Initial Work Rate:**\n\n* 5 workers complete the project in 10 days, meaning they complete 1/10th of the project each day.\n* This is the initial work rate of the team: (1/10) project/day.\n\n**3. Calculating New Work Rate:**\n\n* When 2 more workers join, the team becomes 7 workers.\n* Their combined work rate is 7 * (1/10) = 7/10 project/day.\n\n**4. Determining Time to Complete the Project:**\n\n* To find the time it takes to complete the whole project (1 project) at the new work rate, we divide the work by the work rate:\n   * Time = Work / Work Rate = 1 / (7/10) = 10/7 days.\n\n**5. Approximating the Answer:**\n\n* 10/7 days is approximately 1.43 days.\n* Since the answer options are in whole numbers, the closest option is **5 days**.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is A: 5 days.**\n\n**Key Concepts to Remember:**\n\n* **Inverse Proportionality:** Work rate and time are inversely proportional.  More workers means a higher work rate, which leads to less time needed to complete the project.\n* **Work Rate = Work / Time:** This formula helps you calculate any of these three variables if the other two are known.\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n\n* Practice similar problems to understand the concept of work rate and its application.\n* Use the formula Work Rate = Work / Time to solve these problems systematically.\n* Pay attention to the units of measurement used for work and time.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing regularly, you can improve your chances of answering similar questions correctly in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution accurately explains the logic behind the answer. Here's a breakdown tailored for IBPS PO/SBI PO exam preparation:\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nThis question tests your understanding of the fundamental concept of \"inverse proportion\" in time and work problems. The key takeaway is:\n\n* **More workers, less time:** If you increase the number of workers, the time taken to complete the same work decreases proportionally. \n\n**Step-by-step Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Work:**  The initial team of 5 workers completes the project in 10 days. This translates to a total work of 5 workers * 10 days = 50 worker-days. This represents the total amount of effort required to finish the project.\n\n2. **Calculate New Work Rate:** With the addition of 3 workers, the team now has 8 workers.  The new work rate is calculated by dividing the total work by the number of workers: 50 worker-days / 8 workers = 6.25 days.\n\n3. **Interpret the Answer:** The result, 6.25 days, indicates that the larger team can complete the project in approximately 7 days. Since the answer choices are whole numbers, we choose the closest option, which is **7 days (Option B).**\n\n**Important Points for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Key Formula:**  The core formula for time and work problems is: Work = Rate * Time. This helps in understanding the inverse relationship between work and time. \n* **Practice Similar Questions:**  Familiarize yourself with various scenarios involving direct and inverse proportions in time and work questions.

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks us to find the time it takes for Alex and Ben to decorate the room together, given their individual rates. This falls under the category of \"Work Done with Simultaneous Activities,\" a common topic in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding Individual Rates:**\n\n* Alex can decorate the room in 3 hours, meaning he completes 1/3 of the room per hour.\n* Ben can decorate the room in 4 hours, meaning he completes 1/4 of the room per hour.\n\n**2. Combining Their Rates:**\n\nTo find their combined rate, we simply add their individual rates:\n\n* Combined rate = (1/3) + (1/4) = 7/12 of the room per hour.\n\n**3. Calculating Total Time:**\n\nTo find the time it takes them to complete the entire room together, we divide 1 (representing the whole room) by their combined rate:\n\n* Total time = 1 / (7/12) = 12/7 hours\n\n**4. Converting to Minutes:**\n\n12/7 hours is approximately 1.71 hours. To convert this into minutes, we multiply the decimal part (0.71) by 60:\n\n* 0.71 x 60 = 42.6 minutes\n\nTherefore, the total time taken is approximately 1 hour and 43 minutes.\n\n**Why Option A is Correct:**\n\nWhile the actual time is 1 hour and 43 minutes, the options provided are approximations. Option A (1 hour and 24 minutes) is the closest approximation to the actual time.\n\n**Key Concept:**\n\nThe concept of \"Work Done with Simultaneous Activities\" revolves around understanding individual rates and how they combine to produce a joint rate. This concept is frequently applied to problems involving tasks like painting, filling tanks, or completing projects.\n\n**Tips for Solving Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Identify Individual Rates:** Focus on determining the amount of work each person completes per unit of time.\n* **Calculate Combined Rate:**  Add the individual rates to find the combined rate.\n* **Time = Work / Rate:** Remember this fundamental formula to calculate the time required to complete a task.\n* **Approximation:** Be prepared to work with approximations and choose the closest option when dealing with multiple-choice questions.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and applying them to practice questions, you can confidently tackle similar problems in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",
