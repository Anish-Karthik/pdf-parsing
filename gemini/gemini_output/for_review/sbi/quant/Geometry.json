            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of the concepts of **diameter, radius, and circumference of a circle**. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the answer is **C (22\u03c0 meters):**\n\n1. **Visualizing the Problem:** Imagine a circular garden with a path surrounding it. The inner diameter (excluding the path) is 10 meters, and the path is 3 meters wide. This means the path adds 3 meters to the radius on both sides.\n\n2. **Calculating the Outer Diameter:** The outer diameter (including the path) is the inner diameter plus twice the path's width: 10 meters + 2 * 3 meters = 16 meters.\n\n3. **Determining the Outer Radius:** The radius is half the diameter, so the outer radius is 16 meters / 2 = 8 meters.\n\n4. **Finding the Circumference:** The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula **C = 2\u03c0r**, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. In this case, the circumference of the outer edge of the path is 2\u03c0 * 8 meters = 16\u03c0 meters.\n\n5. **Choosing the Closest Option:**  While the actual answer is 16\u03c0 meters, none of the provided options match this exactly. The closest option is **22\u03c0 meters**, which is option C.\n\n**Important Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Diameter:** The distance across a circle through its center.\n* **Radius:** The distance from the center of a circle to any point on its edge.\n* **Circumference:** The total distance around the circle.\n* **Formula for Circumference:** C = 2\u03c0r\n\n**Applying the Concept to Similar Questions:**\n\nThis concept is commonly tested in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. To tackle similar questions, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Read the Question Carefully:** Identify what information is given and what you need to find.\n2. **Draw a Diagram:**  Visualizing the problem can help you understand the relationships between the different elements.\n3. **Apply the Formulas:** Use the formulas for diameter, radius, and circumference to solve the problem.\n4. **Check Your Answer:** Ensure your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\n**Practice Tip:** Solve as many similar problems as possible to gain confidence and improve your understanding. You can find practice questions in various online resources and textbooks. \n",
