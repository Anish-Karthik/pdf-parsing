            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of binary arithmetic, specifically subtraction. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Convert to Decimal (Optional but Helpful):**\n\nWhile you can solve this entirely in binary, converting to decimal for the initial steps can make it easier to understand. \n\n* **Available memory:** 110111 binary = (1 * 2^5) + (1 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 32 + 16 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 55 decimal\n* **Memory per packet:** 10101 binary = (1 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 16 + 4 + 1 = 21 decimal\n\n**2. Calculate Total Memory Used:**\n\n* **Total memory used:** 10 packets * 21 binary units/packet = 210 binary units\n\n**3. Subtract to Find Remaining Memory:**\n\n* **Remaining memory:** 55 decimal (initial) - 210 decimal (used) = -155 decimal \n\n**4. Convert Back to Binary (If Necessary):**\n\nSince we got a negative value in decimal, it means we've used more memory than available. This is a common situation in these types of problems, indicating an error in the given scenario. \n\n**5. Analyze the Options:**\n\n* None of the options directly correspond to the -155 decimal result. This confirms the problem's inherent flaw.\n* The closest option, **\"D) 1001\"**,  is **incorrect** but might have been arrived at by incorrectly adding the binary values directly without considering the negative result. \n\n**Why the Answer is NOT \"D\":**\n\nOption \"D\" implies that some memory is still available, which is not true based on the given information. The question leads to an illogical situation where more memory is used than initially available.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Understanding Binary:**  Be comfortable with binary-to-decimal and decimal-to-binary conversions.\n* **Binary Arithmetic:** Practice addition and subtraction in binary.\n* **Logical Analysis:**  Even if you get a result, always analyze the answer in the context of the problem.
