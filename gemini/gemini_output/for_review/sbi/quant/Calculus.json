            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks to find the area under the curve of the function f(x) = 3 from x = 1 to x = 4. This is a simple example of calculating the area under a constant function, which forms a rectangle. \n\nHere's how to solve it:\n\n1. **Visualize the Function:** Imagine a horizontal line at y = 3 on a graph. This line represents the function f(x) = 3.\n\n2. **Identify the Rectangle:** The area we need to find is the rectangle formed by this line, the x-axis, and the vertical lines at x = 1 and x = 4.\n\n3. **Calculate the Area:** The area of a rectangle is length * width. \n    * **Length:** The length of the rectangle is the difference between the two x-values (4 - 1 = 3).\n    * **Width:** The width of the rectangle is the constant value of the function (3).\n\n4. **Final Answer:** Therefore, the area under the curve is 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n**The provided options are incorrect. The correct answer is 9, which is not listed. The closest option is C, which is 15.**\n\n**Important Points for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding the concept of area under a curve:** This is a fundamental concept in calculus and is important for understanding various financial applications like calculating cumulative returns, analyzing growth patterns, etc.\n* **Recognizing simple shapes:**  Many problems involving area under a curve can be solved by visualizing simple shapes like rectangles, triangles, or trapezoids.\n* **Using basic geometry:**  The ability to calculate areas of simple shapes using basic geometric formulas is crucial for these exams.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Definite Integrals:** The concept of area under a curve is closely related to definite integrals in calculus. In this problem, we are essentially finding the definite integral of the function f(x) = 3 from x = 1 to x = 4.\n* **Applications in Finance:**  The area under a curve can be used to calculate various financial metrics like:\n    * **Cumulative return:** The area under a price curve represents the total return generated over a period.\n    * **Present value:** The area under a discount curve helps calculate the present value of future cash flows.\n\nBy understanding the basic principles and applying relevant formulas, you can easily solve similar questions in banking exams. \n",

            "question": "A company's revenue function is given by R(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 5, where x represents the number of units sold in thousands. The marginal revenue function, which represents the rate of change in revenue with respect to the number of units sold, is given by the derivative of the revenue function, MR(x) = 6x - 2. Using the definite integral, calculate the total revenue generated by the company when the number of units sold increases from 1000 to 2000 units. ",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the total revenue generated when the number of units sold increases from 1000 to 2000. Here's a detailed explanation of why the provided reasoning is incorrect and how to solve the problem correctly:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts:**\n\n* **Revenue Function:** The revenue function, R(x), gives the total revenue earned by selling 'x' units.\n* **Marginal Revenue Function:** The marginal revenue function, MR(x), is the derivative of the revenue function. It represents the additional revenue earned from selling one more unit.\n* **Definite Integral:** The definite integral of the marginal revenue function over an interval gives the total change in revenue over that interval.\n\n**Applying the Concepts:**\n\n1. **Finding the change in revenue:**  We need to find the definite integral of the marginal revenue function, MR(x) = 6x - 2, from x = 1 (representing 1000 units) to x = 2 (representing 2000 units):\n\n   \u222b(from 1 to 2) (6x - 2) dx = [3x^2 - 2x] (from 1 to 2) = (12 - 4) - (3 - 2) = **7**\n\n   This means the revenue increased by $7000 (since x represents units in thousands). \n\n2. **Finding the initial revenue:**  We need to calculate the revenue generated from selling the first 1000 units (x = 1):\n\n   R(1) = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) + 5 = **6** thousand dollars, or $6000.\n\n3. **Calculating the total revenue:** The total revenue generated from selling 1000 to 2000 units is the initial revenue plus the change in revenue:\n\n   Total revenue = $6000 + $7000 = **$13000**\n\n**Why the provided reasoning is incorrect:**\n\nThe provided reasoning incorrectly interprets the definite integral as the total revenue itself. It does not account for the initial revenue generated from selling the first 1000 units.\n\n**Correct Answer:**\n\nWhile none of the provided options match the calculated answer, **the closest option is (c) $18,000**. This demonstrates that the question might have a mistake in the options. \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Understand the relationship between revenue, marginal revenue, and their respective functions.\n* Remember that the definite integral of the marginal revenue function represents the **change** in revenue, not the total revenue.\n* Always calculate the total revenue by adding the change in revenue to the initial revenue.\n\nThis understanding will help you confidently tackle similar questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",
