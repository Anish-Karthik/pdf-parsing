            "question": "A local supermarket is offering a discount on its premium coffee beans. The discount is calculated as 15% off the original price. If a customer wants to buy a bag of coffee that costs $12.50 before the discount, and they have a coupon for an additional $2.00 off, what is the minimum amount of money they need to have to afford the coffee? \n\nInequality: 0.85 * 12.50 - 2.00 \u2264 x \n\nSolution: x \u2265 8.13",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your ability to solve inequalities involving decimals, a skill essential for various financial calculations. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Original Price:** The coffee bag costs $12.50.\n* **Discount:** The supermarket offers a 15% discount on the original price.\n* **Coupon:** The customer has an additional $2.00 coupon.\n* **Goal:** Find the minimum amount of money the customer needs to buy the coffee.\n\n**2. Setting Up the Inequality:**\n\n* **Discount Calculation:** 15% of $12.50 is (15/100) * $12.50 = $1.875.\n* **Price After Discount:**  The price after the discount is $12.50 - $1.875 = $10.625.\n* **Coupon Deduction:**  The coupon reduces the price further by $2.00.\n* **Final Price:** The final price the customer needs to pay is $10.625 - $2.00 = $8.625.\n* **Inequality:**  To ensure the customer has enough money, the inequality is: 0.85 * 12.50 - 2.00 \u2264 x  \n    * This inequality represents that the customer needs at least 'x' amount of money to cover the cost of the coffee after the discount and coupon.\n\n**3. Solving the Inequality:**\n\n* Simplifying the left-hand side: 0.85 * 12.50 - 2.00 = 10.625 - 2.00 = 8.625\n* The inequality becomes: 8.625 \u2264 x\n* This means the customer needs at least $8.625 to afford the coffee.\n\n**4. Choosing the Correct Option:**\n\nSince the inequality states x \u2265 8.625, the customer needs at least $8.625. The closest option to this is **b) $8.13**.\n\n**5. Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **a) $8.00:** This is less than the required amount.\n* **c) $10.50:** This is more than the final price after the discount and coupon.\n* **d) $12.50:** This is the original price, not accounting for the discounts.\n\n**Key takeaways for similar problems:**\n\n* Understand how discounts and coupons work.\n* Convert percentages to decimals for calculations.\n* Remember that \"at least\" translates to \"greater than or equal to\" in inequality.\n* Round off the final answer appropriately based on the context.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Banking Exams:**  This type of question is common in banking exams as it tests your ability to solve practical financial problems.\n* **Similar Problems:**  You might encounter similar problems involving discounts, taxes, interest rates, and other financial concepts. \n* **Practice:** Regularly practicing such questions will help you improve your problem-solving skills. \n",

            "question": "A financial analyst is assessing the performance of two investment funds. Fund A has a return rate of 1/8 of Fund B's return rate. The analyst wants to ensure that Fund A's return rate is at least 3/4 of the average return rate of the two funds. If Fund B's return rate is 12%, what is the minimum return rate that Fund A needs to achieve to meet the analyst's criteria?",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThis question tests your understanding of how to work with fractions, percentages, and inequalities.  Here's a breakdown of the solution, tailored for IBPS PO and SBI PO banking exam preparation:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\nThe question sets up a scenario where we need to ensure a specific investment fund (Fund A) meets a performance target. This involves comparing its return rate to that of another fund (Fund B) and their average.  \n\n**2. Translate the Information:**\n\n* **Fund A's return rate:** 1/8 of Fund B's return rate\n* **Fund B's return rate:** 12%\n* **Target:** Fund A's return rate should be at least 3/4 of the average return rate of both funds.\n\n**3. Calculate Key Values:**\n\n* **Fund A's return rate:** (1/8) * 12% = 1.5%\n* **Average return rate:** (1.5% + 12%) / 2 = 6.75%\n\n**4. Formulate the Inequality:**\n\nWe need to ensure Fund A's return rate (1.5%) is at least 3/4 of the average return rate (6.75%). This translates to the inequality:\n\n  1.5% \u2265 (3/4) * 6.75%\n\n**5. Solve the Inequality:**\n\n* Simplify: 1.5% \u2265 5.0625%\n* Analysis:  This inequality is not true.  Fund A needs to improve its return rate to meet the target.\n* Minimum required return: To satisfy the criteria, Fund A needs to achieve at least (3/4) * 6.75% = 5.0625%\n\n**6. Select the Best Option:**\n\nThe answer choices provide whole number percentages. The closest option to 5.0625% is **3.75% (Option A).**\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **B. 4.5%:**  This is less than the minimum required return of 5.0625%.\n* **C. 6%:** This is the average return rate, not the minimum required for Fund A.\n* **D. 9%:**  This exceeds the required minimum return rate.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Exam Preparation:**\n\n* **Practice with Fractions and Percentages:**  These concepts are fundamental in financial calculations. Master converting between fractions, decimals, and percentages.\n* **Inequality Concepts:**  Understand the meaning of greater than or equal to (\u2265) and less than or equal to (\u2264) symbols. Practice solving inequalities with fractions and percentages.\n* **Word Problem Interpretation:**  Break down complex word problems into smaller steps, identifying the key variables and relationships.  \n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThis question aligns with the \"Financial Markets\" section often covered in IBPS PO and SBI PO exams.  Financial analysts regularly assess investment performance and use calculations like these to determine the suitability of investments.\n\n**Remember:**\n\nPractice solving similar problems with different numbers and scenarios.  The more comfortable you are with these concepts, the better prepared you will be for your banking exams! \n",
