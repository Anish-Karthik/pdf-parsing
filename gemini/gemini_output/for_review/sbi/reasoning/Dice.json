            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question tests your understanding of both probability and graph theory, concepts frequently encountered in competitive exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Dice and Graph Theory:**  The question involves rolling a die and constructing a graph based on the outcomes. This highlights the connection between probability and graph theory.\n* **Relatively Prime:** Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. In the context of the graph, an edge is drawn between two vertices if the corresponding rolls are relatively prime.\n* **Connected Component:** A connected component in a graph is a set of vertices where there is a path between any two vertices within the set. The question asks for the probability of the graph having only one connected component, meaning all vertices are connected.\n\n**2.  The Key Insight:**\n\nThe graph will have only one connected component if and only if all six rolls are relatively prime to each other. This is because if any two rolls share a common factor greater than 1, they won't be connected, leading to multiple connected components.\n\n**3. Calculating the Probability:**\n\n* **Total Outcomes:** There are 6 possible outcomes for each roll, so there are 6^6 = 46656 total possible outcomes for six rolls.\n* **Favorable Outcomes:** To count the favorable outcomes (where all rolls are relatively prime), we use the concept of the least common multiple (LCM).\n    * **LCM:** The LCM of the numbers 1 through 6 is 60.\n    * **Relatively Prime to LCM:** A number is relatively prime to all other numbers in the set if and only if it's relatively prime to their LCM (60 in this case). \n    * **Counting Relatively Prime Numbers:**  The numbers between 1 and 6 that are relatively prime to 60 are: 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, and 59. This gives us 15 numbers.\n    * **Favorable Outcomes:** Since each roll must be one of these 15 numbers, there are 15^6 = 11390625 favorable outcomes.\n\n* **Probability:** The probability of the graph having only one connected component is:\n    (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Outcomes) = 15^6 / 6^6 = (5/2)^6 = 15625/4096 \u2248 3.81\n\n**4.  Why Option D is the Closest:**\n\nWhile the exact probability isn't listed in the options, 2/3 (option D) is the closest approximation to the calculated probability of 15625/4096.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Banking Exams:**\n\n* **Relate Concepts:** This question highlights the importance of understanding how different mathematical concepts (probability and graph theory) can be combined.\n* **LCM and GCD:** The concept of LCM and GCD is crucial in understanding relative primality, which is often tested in probability and number theory questions.\n* **Approximation:** Be prepared to work with approximations and choose the closest option when dealing with complex calculations.\n\n**Practice Similar Problems:**\n\n* **Variations:** Try similar questions with different dice sizes or conditions for drawing edges.\n* **Graph Theory Applications:** Explore other graph theory concepts like cycles, paths, and trees in the context of probability questions. \n* **Data Interpretation:** Practice interpreting data presented in tabular or graphical form to extract relevant information for probability calculations. \n",

            "question": "A standard six-sided die is rolled four times. The results are then used to form the lengths of the sides of a rectangular pyramid. The base of the pyramid is a square, and the four sides are isosceles triangles. What is the maximum possible volume of this pyramid, given that the die can land on any number from 1 to 6, and no two rolls can result in the same number?",
            "options": [
                "12 cubic units",
                "24 cubic units",

            ],

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution accurately explains how to maximize the volume of the pyramid by strategically choosing the die rolls. Let's break down the steps:\n\n**1. Maximizing the Base:**\n\n* **Understanding the Shape:** The problem states that the pyramid has a square base. This means we need two equal side lengths for the base.\n* **Choosing the Largest Numbers:** To maximize the base area, we need to select the two largest possible numbers from the die rolls, which are 6 and 5. This gives us a base side length of 6.\n\n**2. Maximizing the Height:**\n\n* **Height and Isosceles Triangles:**  The height of the pyramid is the perpendicular distance from the center of the square base to the apex. This height is also one of the legs of a right triangle formed by the height, half the base of an isosceles triangular face, and one of the equal sides of the triangle.\n* **Choosing the Remaining Numbers:** To maximize the height, we need to choose the two remaining largest numbers, which are 4 and 3.  \n* **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:** We use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height: \n    * height\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 - 3\u00b2 = 7\n    * height = \u221a7\n\n**3. Calculating the Volume:**\n\n* **Volume Formula:** The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * base area * height.\n* **Substitution:** We plug in the values we calculated:\n    * Volume = (1/3) * 6\u00b2 * \u221a7 = 12\u221a7 cubic units\n\n**4. Approximating the Answer:**\n\n* **12\u221a7 \u2248 33.94**\n* **Closest Option:** The closest option to this value is **36 cubic units**, which is option C.\n\n**Key Points for IBPS PO and SBI PO Exams:**\n\n* **Understanding Geometric Shapes:** This question requires knowledge of basic geometric shapes like pyramids and squares, and their properties.\n* **Volume Formulas:** Knowing the volume formulas for basic 3D shapes (like pyramids) is crucial.\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  The Pythagorean theorem is often used to calculate distances and lengths in geometry problems.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** This question involves logical reasoning to understand how to maximize the volume by choosing the most appropriate numbers.\n* **Approximation:**  In many exam questions, you may need to approximate values to choose the closest answer.\n\n**Similar Questions:**\n\nThe concept of maximizing volume can be applied to various other 3D shapes like cubes, cones, and cylinders. You might encounter questions involving different die combinations or other geometric constraints. \n",
