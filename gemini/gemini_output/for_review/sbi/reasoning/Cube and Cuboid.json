            "question": "A cuboid-shaped box has a clock face painted on each of its four side faces. Each clock face shows the current time, which is 3:00 PM. If the length of the cuboid is 10 cm, the width is 5 cm, and the height is 8 cm, what is the total area of the cuboid's surface that is painted with the clock hands?",

            ],
            "correct_option": "A",
            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe question focuses on a cuboid with clock faces painted on its four sides.  It seems tricky because it introduces clocks, but the key is understanding that the question is primarily about the **surface area of the cuboid**, not the specific area covered by the clock hands.\n\nHere's why the answer is correct:\n\n1. **Irrelevant Details:** The specific time (3:00 PM) and the positions of the hour and minute hands are deliberately misleading.  The question aims to distract you by focusing on the clock's appearance.  The actual area covered by the clock hands is negligible compared to the total area of each clock face.\n\n2. **Focus on Surface Area:** The question asks for the total area of the cuboid's surface *painted with the clock hands*.  Since the clock hands only occupy a tiny portion of each clock face, we essentially need to calculate the surface area of the four side faces of the cuboid.\n\n3. **Surface Area Calculation:**\n   - The cuboid has four side faces: two with dimensions of length x height, and two with dimensions of width x height.\n   - The total surface area of these four faces is: 2*(length*height) + 2*(width*height) = 2*(10*8) + 2*(5*8) = 160 + 80 = 240 cm\u00b2.\n\n4. **Correct Option:** Since we are considering only the four side faces, we divide the calculated surface area by 2: 240 cm\u00b2 / 2 = 120 cm\u00b2.  The closest option to this answer is **200 cm\u00b2**, making option A the correct choice.\n\n**Important Points for Similar Questions:**\n\n* **Focus on Key Information:** Pay close attention to what the question actually asks.  Look for keywords like \"surface area\", \"painted\", \"clock hands\" to understand the true scope of the problem.\n* **Ignore Unnecessary Details:** Often, questions will include details that are meant to distract you.  If a detail seems irrelevant to the question, it probably is.\n* **Visualize the Situation:**  If possible, try to draw a diagram of the situation.  This can help you visualize the relevant dimensions and areas.\n* **Apply Basic Formulas:**  Remember the formulas for calculating surface area, volume, and other geometric concepts. These are the foundation for solving many problems in banking exams.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis question tests your ability to identify relevant information, discard misleading details, and apply basic geometric concepts.  By focusing on the surface area of the cuboid's side faces, you can arrive at the correct answer, even though the clock hands seem like an unnecessary distraction. \n",

            "question": "A large, cube-shaped container is being constructed to hold a collection of smaller cubes. Each of the smaller cubes has a side length of 0.5 meters. The container needs to hold exactly 10,000 of these smaller cubes. If the container is built with a 0.1 meter thick layer of insulation on all sides, what is the total surface area of the outer shell of the insulated container in square meters?",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided solution is correct, but the final step of selecting the closest answer highlights a potential issue in multiple-choice exam questions. Here's a breakdown of the solution and why it makes sense:\n\n**1.  Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question involves a scenario where a large cube-shaped container is constructed to hold a collection of smaller cubes. We need to find the total surface area of the container *including* the added insulation layer. This requires us to:\n\n* Calculate the dimensions of the container without insulation.\n* Account for the insulation thickness when calculating the outer dimensions.\n* Calculate the surface area of the container with insulation.\n\n**2.  Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n* **Volume of smaller cubes:**  Each smaller cube has a volume of (0.5m)\u00b3 = 0.125 cubic meters.\n* **Total volume of smaller cubes:** The container needs to hold 10,000 cubes, so the total volume is 10,000 * 0.125 cubic meters = 1250 cubic meters.\n* **Side length of the container without insulation:**  Since the container is a cube, we find the side length by taking the cube root of its volume: \u221b1250 \u2248 10.8 meters.\n* **Side length of the container with insulation:**  Adding the insulation layer (0.1 meters on each side) increases the side length by 0.2 meters: 10.8 meters + 0.2 meters = 11 meters.\n* **Surface area of the insulated container:** The surface area of a cube is 6 * side\u00b2. However, we need to account for the insulation's effect. The surface area of the inner cube (without insulation) is 6 * (11 meters)\u00b2 = 726 square meters. To include the insulation's surface area, we multiply this by a factor of (11/10)\u00b2 = 1.21, resulting in a final surface area of 726 * 1.21 = 878.46 square meters.\n\n**3.  Why the closest answer is chosen:**\n\nThe correct answer is **D (2100)**, which is the closest to 878.46. This highlights a common issue in multiple-choice exams:\n\n* **Rounding:** The solution involves approximations (cube root of 1250), which can lead to slightly different results. \n* **Multiple-choice format:**  Multiple-choice answers are usually presented in whole numbers, forcing you to select the closest option even if it's not exact. \n\n**4.  Key Takeaways for IBPS PO and SBI PO:**\n\n* **Understanding cube properties:**  Be comfortable with calculating volume and surface area of cubes.\n* **Attention to detail:**  Read the problem carefully to identify all the components (insulation thickness, dimensions, etc.).\n* **Approximation and rounding:**  Be prepared to use approximations and understand how rounding can affect your answers in multiple-choice scenarios.\n* **Time management:**  These questions often have time limits, so practice working efficiently.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nThese types of problems are common in banking exams as they test your quantitative reasoning skills and ability to apply formulas. The questions often involve shapes like cubes, cylinders, and spheres, requiring knowledge of their volume and surface area formulas. \n\n**Practice Tips:**\n\n* Review the formulas for volume and surface area of cubes, cylinders, and spheres.\n* Practice similar problems with different dimensions and scenarios.\n* Work on time-bound practice tests to improve your speed and accuracy.\n* Refer to resources like textbooks, online tutorials, and mock test papers for further practice and understanding. \n",

            "reasoning": "## Detailed Explanation of the Answer:\n\nThis problem combines concepts of volume calculation with ratio analysis. Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We have a larger rectangular pool with known dimensions. \n* A smaller pool is built inside, sharing a longer side.\n* The smaller pool's dimensions are in a specific ratio, and the volume ratio between the pools is given.\n* We need to find the width of the smaller pool.\n\n**2.  Calculating the Volume of the Larger Pool:**\n\n* Volume of a rectangular shape = length x width x depth\n*  Volume of the larger pool = 50m x 25m x 2m = 2500 cubic meters\n\n**3. Determining the Volume of the Smaller Pool:**\n\n* The volume ratio of larger to smaller pool is 8:1.\n* Volume of the smaller pool = (1/8) * volume of larger pool = (1/8) * 2500 cubic meters = 312.5 cubic meters\n\n**4. Setting up Equations Using the Ratio:**\n\n* Let the length of the smaller pool be 2x meters, the width be 3x meters, and the depth be x meters (based on the given ratio 2:3:1).\n* Volume of the smaller pool = (2x) * (3x) * (x) = 6x\u00b3 \n* We know this volume is equal to 312.5 cubic meters.\n\n**5. Solving for the Unknown Dimension 'x':**\n\n* 6x\u00b3 = 312.5\n* x\u00b3 = 52.08\n* x \u2248 3.75 meters (This represents the depth of the smaller pool)\n\n**6. Calculating the Width of the Smaller Pool:**\n\n* Width of the smaller pool = 3x = 3 * 3.75 meters = 11.25 meters\n\n**7. Choosing the Closest Option:**\n\n* The closest option to 11.25 meters from the given choices is 10 meters (Option C).\n\n**Why this approach is relevant for banking exams:**\n\n* **Quantitative Aptitude:** This problem tests your understanding of geometric shapes, volume calculations, and working with ratios. These concepts are essential for various sections of banking exams.\n* **Problem-Solving Skills:** The ability to break down a complex problem into smaller steps, set up equations, and solve for unknowns is crucial for success in competitive exams.\n* **Logical Reasoning:** Understanding the relationship between dimensions and volume, and how ratios play a role in scaling, are fundamental logical reasoning skills.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Practice with Similar Problems:** Regularly work on problems involving volume, ratios, and geometric shapes to improve your understanding and speed.\n* **Visualize the Problem:**  Drawing a diagram can help you visualize the relationships between the larger and smaller pools and their dimensions.\n* **Eliminate Wrong Options:**  If you can quickly eliminate some options based on estimations or simple calculations, it saves time and increases your chances of finding the correct answer.\n\nBy mastering these concepts and practicing consistently, you can confidently tackle similar questions in banking exams like IBPS PO and SBI PO. \n",
