Within the nephron, a crucial structure called the <span class="bold" style="color:red;">loop of Henle</span> plays a vital role in concentrating the urine.</p>    <hr>  </div>  <div class="section">    <h3>Descending Limb</h3>    <p>This part of the <span class="bold" style="color:red;">loop of Henle</span> is permeable to water but impermeable to ions like sodium (<span class="bold" style="color:red;">Na+</span>). As the filtrate (the fluid filtered from the blood) moves down the descending limb, water passively diffuses out, driven by the higher <span class="bold" style="color:red;">osmolarity</span> (solute concentration) of the surrounding interstitial fluid. This process makes the filtrate progressively more concentrated (<span class="bold" style="color:red;">hypertonic</span>).</p>    <hr>  </div>  <div class="section">    <h3>Ascending Limb</h3>    <p>In contrast to the descending limb, the ascending limb is impermeable to water but permeable to ions like sodium (<span class="bold" style="color:red;">Na+</span>).  Sodium is actively transported out of the ascending limb, contributing to the high <span class="bold" style="color:red;">osmolarity</span> of the medullary interstitial fluid. This process makes the filtrate less concentrated (<span class="bold" style="color:red;">hypotonic</span>) as it ascends.</p>    <hr>  </div>  <div class="section">    <h3>Countercurrent Mechanism and Urine Concentration</h3>    <p>The <span class="bold" style="color:red;">countercurrent flow</span> of the filtrate in the <span class="bold" style="color:red;">loop of Henle</span>, along with the active transport of sodium, creates a concentration gradient in the medullary interstitial fluid. This gradient allows the <span class="bold" style="color:red;">collecting duct</span>, the final segment of the nephron, to reabsorb water from the filtrate, producing a concentrated urine.</p>    <hr>  </div>  <div class="section">    <h3>Importance of the Loop of Henle</h3>    <p>In summary, the descending limb of the <span class="bold" style="color:red;">loop of Henle</span> concentrates the filtrate by allowing water to passively diffuse out, while the ascending limb dilutes the filtrate by actively transporting sodium out. This <span class="bold" style="color:red;">countercurrent mechanism</span> is essential for producing concentrated urine, which helps conserve water in terrestrial animals.</p>  </div></body></html>
