    "passage": "QS$$1 Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even I could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. QE$$1 My father didn\u2019t like to see books in the house. There was something about them\u2014apart from the letters he could not decipher\u2014that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would send me off to work and that I\u2019d better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn\u2019t want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window. \n\t\u201cIf I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d \n\tMy father was not a miser and, despite the hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like \n\tthe other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, and when I\u2019d collected four or five reales I\u2019d secretly rush out to buy myself a book. \n\tMy favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart\u2019s content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn\u2019t looking I\u2019d leave the coins I\u2019d managed to collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change\u2014if I\u2019d had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a QS$$7 weight QE$$7 on my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever. \n\tOne Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full. \n\t\u201cGreat Expectations, by Charles Dickens,\u201d I read on the cover. \n\tI was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them. \n\t\u201cA friend of yours?\u201d \u201cA lifelong QS$$8 friend. QE$$8 And from now on, he\u2019s your QS$$8 friend QE$$8 too.\u201d That afternoon I took my new friend home, hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn\u2019t see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn\u2019t want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.",
