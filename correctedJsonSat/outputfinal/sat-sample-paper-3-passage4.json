    "passage": "The \u201cwisdom of crowds\u201d has become a mantra of the Internet age. Need to choose a new vacuum cleaner? Check out the reviews on online merchant Amazon. But a new study suggests that such online scores don\u2019t always reveal the best choice. A massive controlled experiment of Web users finds that such ratings are highly susceptible to irrational \u201cherd behavior\u201d\u2014and that the herd can be manipulated. \n\tSometimes the crowd really is wiser than you. The classic examples are guessing the weight of a bull or the number of gumballs in a jar. Your guess is probably going to be far from the mark, whereas the average of many people\u2019s choices is remarkably close to the true number. \n\tBut what happens when the goal is to judge something less tangible, such as the quality or worth of a product? According to one theory, the wisdom of the crowd still holds\u2014measuring the aggregate of people\u2019s opinions produces a stable, reliable value. QS$$3 Skeptics, QE$$3 however, argue that people\u2019s opinions are easily swayed by those of others. So nudging a crowd early on by presenting contrary opinions\u2014for example, exposing them to some very good or very bad attitudes\u2014will steer the crowd in a different direction. To test which hypothesis is true, you would need to manipulate huge numbers of people, exposing them to false information and determining how it affects their opinions. \n\tA team led by Sinan Aral, a network scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, did exactly that. Aral has been secretly working with a popular website that aggregates news stories. The website allows users to make comments about news stories and vote each other\u2019s comments up or down. The vote tallies are visible as a number next to each comment, and the position of the comments is chronological. (Stories on the site get an average of about ten comments and about three votes per comment.) It\u2019s a follow-up to his experiment using people\u2019s ratings of movies to measure how much individual people influence each other online (answer: a lot). This time, he wanted to know how much the crowd influences the individual, and whether it can be controlled from outside. \n\tFor five months, every comment submitted by a user randomly received an \u201cup\u201d vote (positive); a \u201cdown\u201d vote (negative); or as a control, no vote at all. The team then observed how users rated those comments. The users generated more than 100,000 comments that were viewed more than 10 million times and rated more than 300,000 times by other users. \n\tAt least when it comes to comments on news sites, the crowd is more herdlike than wise. Comments that received fake positive votes from the researchers were 32% more likely to receive more positive votes compared with a control, the team reports. And those comments were no more likely than the control to be down-voted by the next viewer to see them. By the end of the study, positively manipulated comments got an overall boost of about 25%. However, the same did not hold true for negative manipulation. The ratings of comments that got a fake down vote were usually negated by an up vote by the next user to see them. \n\t\u201cOur experiment does not reveal the psychology behind people\u2019s decisions,\u201d Aral says, \u201cbut an intuitive explanation is that people are more skeptical of negative social influence. They\u2019re more willing to go along with positive opinions from other people.\u201d \n\tDuncan Watts, a network scientist at Microsoft Research in New York City, agrees with that conclusion. \u201c[But] one question is whether the positive [herding] bias is specific to this site\u201d or true in general, Watts says. He points out that the category of the news items in the experiment had a strong effect on how much people could be manipulated. \u201cI would have thought that \u2018business\u2019 is pretty similar to \u2018economics,\u2019 yet they find a much stronger effect (almost 50% stronger) for the former than the latter. What explains this difference? If we\u2019re going to apply these findings in the real world, we\u2019ll need to know the answers.\u201d \n\tWill companies be able to QS$$5 boost QE$$5 their products by manipulating online ratings on a massive QS$$6 scale? QE$$6 \u201cThat is easier said than done,\u201d Watts says. If people detect\u2014or learn\u2014that comments on a website are being manipulated, the herd may spook and leave entirely.",
