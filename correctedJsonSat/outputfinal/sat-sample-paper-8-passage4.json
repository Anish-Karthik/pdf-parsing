    "passage": "Passage 1 Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a land whose coast lines would enclose half the countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people that He has planted on this soil; a people sprung from the most masterful blood of history; a people perpetually revitalized by the virile . . . working-folk of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their power, by right of their institutions, by authority of their heaven-directed purposes\u2014the propagandists and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a history heroic with faith in our mission and our future; a history of statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands . . . a history of soldiers, who carried the flag across blazing deserts and through the ranks of hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a history of a multiplying people, who overran a continent in half a century . . . a history divinely logical, in the process of whose tremendous reasoning we find ourselves to-day. . . . QS$$1 \n\tThink of the thousands of Americans who will pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the Republic\u2019s laws cover those islands with justice and safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans who will invade . . . the Philippines when a liberal government . . . shall establish order and equity there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who will build a . . . civilization of energy and industry in Cuba, when a government of law replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!\u2014 think of the prosperous millions that Empress of Islands will support when, obedient to the law of political gravitation, her people ask for the highest honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great Republic! QE$$1 \n\tPassage 2 If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the Republican party ought to state its position and defend it, but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability. \n\tThe Filipinos do not need any encouragement from Americans now living. Our whole history has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their own government. If the Republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated to make the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, \u201cGive me liberty or give me death,\u201d he exprest a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men. Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of history none have used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists must choose between liberty and slavery. Or, if the statute of limitations has run against the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular government when the present advocates of force and conquest are forgotten. \n\tSome one has said that a truth once spoken can never be QS$$2 recalled. QE$$2 It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it were possible to obliterate every word written or spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it was God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master. \n\tThose who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must consider, not only the effect of imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also QS$$5 calculate QE$$5 its effects upon our own nation. We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here.",
