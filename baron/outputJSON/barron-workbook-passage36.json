  "passage": "QS$$0 SHS$$ \tPassage 1\n\tThe SHE$$ two-month-old baby has hardly roused himself from the long night of his first weeks in this world when he is confronted with some of the profound problems of the race. We invite him to study the nature of reality, to differentiate QE$$0 self and non-self, and to establish useful criteria in each of these categories.\n\tA project of such magnitude in academic research would require extensive laboratory equipment and personnel; to be fair about it,  it has taken just that to reconstruct the experiments of QS$$1 the infant. And there are few grown and fully accredited scientists who can equal the infant for zeal and energy in sorting out the raw data in this project. His equipment is limited to QE$$1 his sensory organs, his hands, his mouth, and a primitive memory apparatus.\n\tAt two months, as we have seen, he recognizes an object that we know to be a human face and we know to be an object outside himself.\n\tBut to the baby this is just an image, an image incidentally that he can\u2019t differentiate from the mental image, the picture in memory.\n\tBut this face is one piece in the jigsaw puzzle\u2014a key piece, we think. Then gradually in the weeks to come the association of breast or bottle, of hands, voice, a multitude of pleasurable sense experiences begin to cluster around this face and to form the crude image of a  person.\n\t\tMeantime the infant is conducting a series of complicated experiments in sensory discrimination.\n\tWe must remember that in the early months he does not discriminate between his body and other bodies. When he clutches the finger of his mother or his father he doesn\u2019t see it as someone else\u2019s finger and his behavior indicates that he treats it exactly the same as he does his own finger. It takes him some time, in fact, to recognize his own hand at sight and to acquire even a rudimentary feeling that this is part of his own body. In  the first group of experiments he discovers that the object that passes occasionally in front of his eyes (which we know to be his hand) is the same as the object with visual and taste qualities that he can identify. In another experimental series he discovers that the sensations that accompany the introduction of this object into his mouth are different from those experienced when he takes a nipple into his mouth, or a toy, or his mother\u2019s or father\u2019s finger.\n\t Passage 2\n\tVery soon after SHS$$ birth, environmental SHE$$ forces, or response contingencies, begin to operate in conjunction with the infant\u2019s  built-in response repertoire to produce learned changes in behavior. It will not be long before the baby, instead of awaiting a touch near the mouth to open it, will do so when the bottle or nipple is seen approaching it. Or the head may be turned in the appropriate direction when the baby is placed in the accustomed feeding posture.\n\tSuch anticipatory gestures symbolize the QS$$6 essence of learning. Such response systems are the classically conditioned or Pavlovian variety, because they involve elicited behavior.\n\tOperant QE$$6 conditioning is in a sense also anticipatory; the infant makes a response presumably in anticipation of receiving a reward.\n\tResponse consequences serve as reinforcers of the behavior, then, and tend to perpetuate the behavior. Thus an infant who spontaneously makes a sound, which is then followed by an attractive consequence such as sweet fluid or the smiling presence of the mother, will very likely repeat the act with increasing frequency as time (and reinforcement) goes on.\n\tSimilarly, a response which is followed by an aversive consequence, such as a frightening noise, will tend not to be repeated in the future. The infant thus behaves in accordance with expectations about the availability of  positive reinforcers or punishments, based upon past experience.\n\tIt must be clear by now that thought begins at birth. There are psychologists who would not want to term the anticipatory gestures just spoken of as thought. Even they, however, would have difficulty pinpointing the stage of development or learning at which the onset of thought occurs. It is perhaps more meaningful to speak of increasing levels of symbolization.\n\tA QS$$8 number of developmental theorists have postulated stages of QE$$8 thought development.\n\tWhile no two systems or theories of cognition or thought development are exactly the same, most are agreed that the baby begins with a primitive appreciation of what is there and what is not, and most agree that early in life what is not there is unimportant to the child.\n\tOnly with increasing cortical development, cognitive complexity, and experience in sensing, perceiving, and storing information does the child begin to take into consideration the current absence of past stimulation and to  consider how things are different or might be different than they are. Such \u201cmental manipulations\u201d occur later and set the stage for very symbolic higher thought processes of which mature persons are capable.",
