  "passage": "\tPassage 1\n\tIn 1948 my father was serving his second term as sheriff of Mercer County, Montana.\n\tWe lived in Bentrock, the county seat and the only town of any size in the region. In 1948 its population was less than two thousand people....\n\tMany of the men in Mercer County had spent the preceding years in combat. (But not my father; he was 4-F. When he was sixteen a horse kicked him, breaking his leg so severely that he walked with a permanent limp, and eventually a cane, his right leg V-ed in, his right knee perpetually pointing to the left.) When these men came back from war they wanted nothing more than to work their farms and ranches and to live quietly with their families.\n\tThe county even had fewer hunters after the war than before.\n\tAll of which made my father\u2019s job a relatively easy one. Oh, he arrested the usual weekly drunks, mediated an occasional dispute about fence lines or stray cattle, calmed a few domestic disturbances, and warned the town\u2019s teenagers about getting rowdy in Wood\u2019s Cafe, but by and large being sheriff of Mercer County did not require great strength or courage. The ability to drive the county\u2019s rural roads, often drifted over in the winter or washed out in the summer, was a much more necessary skill than being good with your fists or a gun. One of my father\u2019s regular duties was chaperoning Saturday night dances in the county, but the fact that he often took along\n\tmy mother (and sometimes me) shows how quiet those affairs\u2014and his job\u2014usually were.\n\tAnd that disappointed me at the time. As long as my father was going to be sheriff, a position with so much potential for excitement, danger, and bravery, why couldn\u2019t some of that promise be fulfilled? No matter how many wheat fields or cow pastures surrounded us, we were still Montanans, yet my father didn\u2019t even look like a western sheriff. He wore a shirt and tie, as many of the men in town did, but at least they wore boots and Stetsons; my father wore brogans and a fedora. He had a gun but he never carried it, on duty or off. I knew because I checked, time and time again. When he left the house I ran to his dresser and the top drawer on the right side. And there it was, there it always was.\n\tJust as well. As far as I was concerned it was the wrong kind of gun for a sheriff. He should have had a nickel-plated Western Colt.45, something with some history and heft. Instead, my father had a small.32 automatic, Italian-made and no bigger than your palm.\n\tMy father didn\u2019t buy such a sorry gun; he confiscated it from a drunken transient in one of his first arrests. My father kept the gun but in fair exchange bought the man a bus ticket to Billings, where he had family.\n\t Passage 2\n\tHe was good-looking, in a Southern, romantic poet sort of way. He needed those good looks, one of the aunts said; why else would my otherwise sensible mother have married a man like him, an actor-writer hyphenate who lived on dreams and spent his free evenings carrying a spear at the Opera House. But that was in later times, when he had moved out of the rundown communal house in the Berkeley Hills, leaving my mother and the ever-changing cast of nominal uncles and aunts to patch the ancient water heater and pump out the basement when the overpressured valve finally blew. He needed separateness to write, he said, solitude, something we\u2019d never given him, and he was tired, tired of being dragged from his study to tend to the latest household eruption that bubbled up \u201clike gas from a Calistoga mud bath,\u201d he said, with relentless regularity.\n\tHe looked tired by then, as tired of us as we were of him, of forgotten birthdays and surprises that failed to surprise. When he did bring us a present, I even wondered why, for it was always somehow off: last season\u2019s hot toy no one played with any more, or a complicated model no boy could assemble without a father\u2019s help. Which we never got. He was an actor, after all, not tech crew, an artist, not someone who could fix a toy.\n\tIf he was an actor, we were props at best.\n\tReluctant ones\u2014had there been a Plantagenet Pleasure Faire, he would have strutted his hour as Wicked Dick III, while Geoffrey and I, thrust into burlap sacks, were hauled off, two little princes in shabby tights, to be disposed of elsewhere. That was his glory, kinging it.\n\tLiving History,1 he called it, and in the early days he followed the fairs up and down the state, living the Renaissance first in Agoura, then in Marin, finally winding up the acting season with Victoria\u2019s England in San Francisco or even Oakland for one or two  slow years.\n\t\tNot that anyone ever hired him to act the king. No, he was a minor figure even on that rude stage, a charming but lesser nobleman in Elizabeth\u2019s court, an attentive councilor in Victoria\u2019s entourage. But he shared the perks of royalty, such as they were, stood center stage in black velvet pantaloons while the September sun burned overhead, or posed handsomely (in a Prince Albert coat, no less) as the royal party made its way through the Christmas crowds at Dickens Fair. Why he stuck to it, I never understood. Certainly not for the pay.\n\tBetween fairs he wrote, or thought of writing, shut up in his study, into which we children were not allowed, or did research for his one-man-shows (in which he played a series of writers, one per show, so that one year we saw his Edgar Allan Poe, another year, his Ambrose Bierce). He was a writer, or at least a writer once removed, writing down other men\u2019s words and speaking them as if they were his own. At times it seemed he thought they were his own, he paraphrased them so freely, vamping upon the themes of The Devil\u2019s Dictionary.2 And he probably thought we were his own as well, as little acquainted with us as he was. And so we were, if only by example and heredity.\n\t1 Since the 1960s, California\u2019s Living History Centre has produced fairs and festivals in northern and southern California. The Renaissance Pleasure Faire is set in the time of Queen Elizabeth I; the Dickens Christmas Fair and Pickwick Comic Annual, in the time of Queen Victoria.\n\t2 A book of diabolical epigrams by Ambrose Bierce.",
