  "passage": "\tThe book from which the following passage was taken explains architectural methods both past and present. \n\tThe ancient Chinese believed that in the features of the natural landscape one could glimpse the mathematically precise order of the universe and all the beneficial and harmful forces that were harmoniously connected according to the principle of the Tao\u2014the Way. This was not a question of metaphor; the topography did not represent good or evil; it really was good or evil. Under these circum- stances, locating a building in the landscape became a decision of momentous proportions that could affect an individual and his family for generations to come. The result was feng- shui, which means \u201cwind and water,\u201d and which was a kind of cosmic surveying tool. Its coherent, scientific practice dates from the Sung dynasty (960-1126), but its roots are much older than that. It was first used to locate grave sites\u2014the Chinese worshiped their ancestors, who, they believed, influenced the good fortune of their descendants. Eventually it began to be used to locate the homes of the living; and, indeed, the earliest book on feng- shui, published during the Han dynasty (202 B.C.-A.D. 220), was entitled The Canon of the Dwellings. Feng-shui combined an intricate set of related variables that reflected the three great 94 CRITICAL READING WORKBOOK FOR THE SAT / READING COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS\n\treligions of China\u2014Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. First were the Taoist principles of yang and yin\u2014male and female. The five Buddhist planets corresponded to the five ele- ments, the five directions (north, south, west, east, and center), and the five seasons (the usual four and midsummer). Feng-shui employed the sixty-four epigrams of the I- Ching, a classic manual of divination popular- ized by Confucius, and also made use of the astrological signs: the constellations were divided into four groups: the Azure Dragon (east), the Black Tortoise (north), the White Tiger (west), and the Red Bird (south). The first task of the geomancer, who was called feng-shui hsien sheng, or \u201cdoctor of the vital force,\u201d was to detect the presence of each of these variables in the natural landscape. Hilly ground represented the Dragon; low ground was the Tiger: the ideal was to have the Dragon on the left and the Tiger on the right (hence, to face south). In a predominant- ly hilly area, however, a low spot was a good place to build; in flatter terrain, heights were considered lucky. The best site was the junc- tion between the Dragon and the Tiger, which is why the imperial tombs around Beijing are so beautifully situated, just where the valley floor begins to turn into mountain slopes. The shape of mountain peaks, the pres- ence of boulders, and the direction of streams all incorporated meanings that had to be unraveled. Often simple observation did not suffice, and the Chinese had to resort to exter- nal aids. The mariner compass was a Chinese invention, but the feng-shui compass served a different purpose. It resembled a large, flat, circular platter. In the center, like the bull\u2019s- eye of a dartboard, was a magnetic needle, surrounded by eighteen concentric circles. Each ring represented a different factor and was inscribed with the constellations, odd and even numbers, the planets and the elements, the seasons, the hexagrams, the signs of the zodiac, the solar orbit, and so on. With the aid of the compass, the geomancer could discover the existence of these variables even when they were not visible to the naked eye. It might appear that feng-shui made man the victim of fate, but this is not the case. For one thing, there was a moral dimension to the belief; and to gain the full benefit of an auspi-\n\tciously placed home, the family itself had to remain honest and upright. Moreover, the geo- mancer\u2019s job was not only to identify bad and good sites but also to advise on how to miti- gate evil influences or to improve good ones. Trees could be planted to camouflage undesir- able views; streams could be rerouted; mounds could be built up or cut down. It is no accident that the greatest Chinese art of all is gardening. Many villages in China have a grove of trees or bamboo behind them, and a pond in front. The function of these picturesque fea- tures is not as landscaping embellishment, or at least it is not only that; they are intended to fend off evil influences. The pagodas that can still be seen built on the tops of hills and mounds serve the same purpose. When visit- ing some recently built farmhouses in the county of Wuqing, I noticed that the entrances to some of the courtyards were screened by a wall that forced the visitor to wind his way around it, as in a maze or an obstacle course. But the purpose of the ying-pei, as the Chinese walls are called, is not to prevent the passerby from looking in. These are \u201cspirit walls\u201d and are meant to keep out asomatous1 trespassers. The ying-pei is not an isolated superstition, like lucky horseshoes in the West; it too is part of feng-shui. 1Lacking a body; ghostly; spirit-like.",
