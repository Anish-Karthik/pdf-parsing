  "passage": "\tThe following passages, written in the 1960s, explore the roots of anti-Japanese and anti-Jewish feelings in America during the first half of the twentieth century. Passage 1\n\tPrejudice, the sociologists tell us, is learned behavior. Twentieth-century Californians learned the lesson well. Although racial prejudice, directed at various ethnic groups, flourished throughout the United States during the period under discussion, nowhere north of the Mason-Dixon line did any single group encounter the sustained nativist assault that was directed against California\u2019s Japanese. There seem to be four chief reasons for this. First, the Japanese were of a distinct racial group; no amount of accul- turation could mask their foreignness. Second, unlike the Chinese, they rapidly began to chal- lenge whites in many businesses and profes- sions\u2014as a group, Japanese in the United States became very quickly imbued with what, in Europeans, would be called the Protestant ethic. Third, the growing unpopularity of their homeland... further served to make immi- grants from Japan special objects of suspicion. These three conditions would have made any large group of Japanese a particularly despised minority anywhere in the United States. Finally, the fact that most of the Japanese were in California probably made things worse, for California probably had a lower boiling point than did the country at large. California, by virtue of its anti-Chinese tradition and frontier psychology, was already conditioned to anti-Orientalism before the Japanese arrived. Other special California characteristics abetted the success of the agita- tion. In the prewar years, the extraordinary\n\tpower of organized labor in northern California gave the anti-Japanese movement a much stronger base than it would have enjoyed elsewhere; in the postwar years, open-shop southern California proved almost equally hospitable to an agitation pitched to middle-class white Protestants. In the two periods anti-Japanese sentiment flourished among completely disparate populations: the first- and second-generation immigrants who were the backbone of California\u2019s labor move- ment, and the Midwestern \u00e9migr\u00e9s who came to dominate the southern California scene. For most of these Californians, opposition to the Japanese was based upon fears which were largely nonrational.  Passage 2\n\tTo say that anti-Semitism in America sprang chiefly from the difficulties of integrat- ing large numbers of first- and second-genera- tion immigrants is, inferentially, to stress its similarity to other kinds of anti-immigrant sentiment\u2014to put it in the same class with  dislike of the Irish, Italians, Japanese, Mexicans and other transplanted minorities, while making allowances for the differential characteristics of each group. Likewise, this approach minimizes distinctions often made between different kinds of anti-Semitism, in that it relates all of them to a common root. Yet we must also consider the role of irrational anti-Semitic fantasies that had no direct con- nection with real problems of ethnic integra- tion. The ideological hatreds spread by the agitator and the fanatic have had a place in American history, too.\n\tGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE Unlike... more ordinary social prejudices ... , ideological anti-Semitism condemns the Jews as incapable of assimilation and disloyal to the basic institutions of the country. In its more extreme forms, it portrays them as leagued together in a vast international con- spiracy. The alleged plot usually centers on gaining control of the money supply and wrecking the financial system; sometimes it extends to polluting the nation\u2019s morals through control of communications and enter- tainment. The supposed eventual aim is to overthrow the government and establish a superstate. In America, anti-Semitism of this kind has not been so well organized or so pro- ductive of violence as other racial and reli- gious phobias. But it has enjoyed an unusually rich and complex imagery.  Religious motifs, by and large, have not figured prominently in American anti-Semitic thought. Except among certain preachers spawned by the Fundamentalist movement of the 1920s (notably Gerald Winrod and Gerald L. K. Smith), one looks in vain for a clearly religious animus. Though not entirely lacking in references to the treachery of Judas, ideo- logical anti-Semitism has always dwelled mainly on the power of Shylock. Whether the Jew appears in his traditional role as exploiter or in his later incarnation as Bolshevik, his subversive influence supposedly flows from an unwillingness or inability to abide by the existing economic morality.",
