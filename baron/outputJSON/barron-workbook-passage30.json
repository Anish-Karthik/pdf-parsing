  "passage": "\tA year after he had come to live with them Mr. and Mrs. Moreen suddenly gave up the villa at Nice. Pemberton had got used to suddenness, having seen it practiced on a considerable scale during two jerky little tours\u2014one in Switzerland the first summer, and the other late in the winter, when they all ran down to Florence and then, at the end of ten days, liking it much less than they had intended, straggled back in mysterious depression. They had returned to Nice \u201cfor ever,\u201d as they said; but this didn\u2019t prevent their squeezing, one rainy muggy May night, into a second-class railway-carriage\u2014you could never tell by which class they would travel\u2014where Pemberton helped them to stow away a wonderful collection of bundles and bags. The explanation of this manoeuvre was that they had determined to spend the summer \u201cin some bracing place\u201d; but in Paris they dropped into a small furnished apartment\u2014a fourth floor in a third-rate avenue, where there was a smell on the staircase and the portier1 was hateful\u2014 and passed the next four months in blank  indigence. The better part of this forced temporary stay belonged to the tutor and his pupil, who, visiting the Invalides2 and Notre Dame, the Conciergerie and all the museums, took a hundred rewarding rambles. They learned to know their Paris, which was useful, for they came back another year for a longer stay, the general character of which in Pemberton\u2019s memory today mixes pitiably and confusedly with that of the first. He sees Morgan\u2019s shabby knickerbockers\u2014the everlasting pair that didn\u2019t match his blouse and that as he grew longer\n\tcould only grow faded. He remembers the  particular holes in his three or four pairs of colored stockings. Morgan was dear to his mother, but he never was better dressed than was absolutely necessary\u2014partly, no doubt, by his own fault, for he was as indifferent to his appearance as a German philosopher. \u201cMy dear fellow, so are you! I don\u2019t want to cast you in the shade.\u201d Pemberton could have no rejoinder for this\u2014 the assertion so closely represented the fact. If however the deficiencies of his own wardrobe were a chapter by themselves he didn\u2019t like his little charge to look too poor. Later he used to say \u201cWell, if we\u2019re poor, why, after all,  shouldn\u2019t we look it?\u201d and he consoled himself with thinking there was something rather elderly and gentlemanly in Morgan\u2019s disrepair\u2014it differed from the untidiness of the urchin who plays and spoils his things. He could trace perfectly the degrees by which, in proportion as her little son confined himself to his tutor for society, Mrs. Moreen shrewdly forbore to renew his garments. She did nothing that didn\u2019t show, neglected him because he escaped notice, and then, as he illustrated this clever policy, discouraged at home his public appearances. Her position was logical enough\u2014those members of her family who did show had to be showy. During this period and several others Pemberton was quite aware of how he and his comrade might strike people; wandering languidly through the Jardin des Plantes3 as if they had nowhere to go, sitting on the winter days in the galleries of the Louvre, so splendidly ironical to the homeless, as if for the advantage of the steam radiators. They joked about it sometimes: it was the sort of joke that was perfectly within the boy\u2019s compass. They figured themselves as part of the vast vague hand-to-mouth multitude of the enormous  city and pretended they were proud of their  position in it\u2014it showed them \u201csuch a lot of life\u201d and made them conscious of a democratic brotherhood. If Pemberton couldn\u2019t feel a sympathy in destitution with his small companion\u2014for after all Morgan\u2019s fond parents would never have let him really suffer\u2014the boy would at least feel it with him, so it came to the same thing. He used sometimes to wonder what people would think they were\u2014to fancy they were looked askance at, as if it might be a suspected case of kidnapping. Morgan wouldn\u2019t be taken for a young patrician with a tutor\u2014he wasn\u2019t smart enough\u2014 though he might pass for his companion\u2019s sickly little brother. Now and then he had a five-franc piece, and except once, when they bought a couple of lovely neckties, one of which he made Pemberton accept, they laid it out scientifically in old books. This was sure to be a great day, always spent at the used book stands on the quays, in a rummage of the dusty boxes that garnish the parapets. Such occasions helped them to live, for their books ran low very soon after the beginning of their acquaintance. Pemberton had a good many in England, but he was obliged to write to a friend and ask him kindly to get some fellow to give him something for them. 1 Hall porter or custodian. 2 Famous Paris monument; site of the tomb of Napoleon. 3 Botanical garden.",
