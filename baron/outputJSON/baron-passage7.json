  "passage": "\n\tAlready, the fire was dying. Kolya watched, stonily, silently, as the warm, orange ribbons began to unravel, and vanish beneath the cinders. To feed the thing seemed pointless\u2014almost cruel\u2014and he wondered if perhaps it was better to stamp it out than to let it starve. He too, after all, was hungry. He too, after all, was cold.\n\tAlready that winter, he had fed it half the books in his great grandfather\u2019s library. It had eaten up all the Napoleonic settees and tables that once adorned his ancestral home. He\u2019d even offered it his mother\u2019s beloved mandolin, letting the strings on which she\u2019d plucked his somber lullabies catch fire, snap, and turn to ash. He watched it happen, and felt nothing. Nothing, that is, but warm. It was winter, and sentimentality was not in season\u2014nor had it been for many months. Besides, no one still living in the house knew how to play it.\n\t\u201cWill this be enough?\u201d Anna entered the barren parlor, shivering, and dragging a rococo cradle behind her, \u201cIt\u2019s not large, but I think it\u2019s dry.\u201d\n\tKolya nodded, watching her words turn to plumes of pale steam as she spoke. Much like the lullabies, the cradle had long outlived its purpose. With pale hands, he broke free the first turned bar, and snapped it over his knee before condemning the splintered ends to the furnace. Anna sat, and warmed her hands.\n\tShe was right: the wood was dry. And dry wood, lately, was worth more to them than rubies. The rains, Kolya recalled, had come too early that autumn. Down in the village, where Anna\u2019s family lived, he\u2019d overheard the pilgrims in the street, with their silvery beards, and mud-caked sandals, speaking of a great rasputitsa* to the south. They\u2019d said it was an ill omen. They\u2019d said there were stirrings in the capital. Kolya, at the time, had smiled. It pleased him to belong to so remote a province, cut off from the ugliness of cities and the southern roads.\n\tBut every day until they froze, the rains grew heavier, and the news still worse. A prince disappeared in Moscow. A farmer\u2019s wagon went missing in the mire. They found his horse the following morning, buried up to its bridle, though he, like a sailor lost at sea, had vanished. It wasn\u2019t long before the carts quit coming altogether, and in October, with the war on, the train quit coming as well. There was no timber from the taiga, no grain from the steppes, nor sunflower seeds from the fertile, far-off south. And Kolya, for the first time, came to know the cost of living at the edge of the world.\n\t\u201cWe\u2019re running out of tinder, you know,\u201d Anna turned to him. \u201cHow much longer do you really think we can stay here?\u201d\n\tKolya frowned, \u201cThe entire house is tinder\u2014we can tear out the rafters if we need to,\u201d he said as he laid more wood on the fire, and hung a cast iron kettle over the coals. \u201cSo long as the root cellar holds, I think we can stay.\u201d\n\t\u201cBut how long will that be?\u201d Anna creased her brow.\n\tShe was anxious. Her father ought to have returned from his trapline four days ago, but the snows had been heavier than expected. Probably, he was just caught on the other side of the pass until the storm cleared\u2014probably. Kolya stirred the kettle slowly, mixing together the blood-red beets, and the ice-white cabbage. The nightly stews with which they\u2019d started out the winter had given way to a thin, translucent soup. It would not be long, Kolya mused, before they were little more than seasoned water.\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied, raising a rabbit bone from the bottom of the pot\u2014the only remnant of her father\u2019s last outing. He ladled out a bowl for Anna, \u201cAt least, no one will go hungry tonight.\u201d\n\tShe did not smile, but leaned back to gaze at the intricate millwork and murals overhead.\n\t\u201cWhen I was young, you know,\u201d she sighed, \u201cI often dreamt of living here. Dolokhov Palace\u2014it seemed so mysterious up on the hill. I dreamt of lavish winter balls, of being courted by boys who would call me \u2018Countess\u2019.\u201d\n\tKolya smirked grimly, taking a bowl for himself, and sat beside her.\n\t\u201cIt is a dream come true, then, Countess Anna.\u201d\n\tShe shivered. Even now, she could neither smile, nor meet his gaze.\n\t\u201cPerhaps it is, Prince Nikolai. But now I\u2019d much rather be awake.\u201d * \u2018Sea of mud,\u2019 a semiannual occurrence when the unpaved roads of Russia become difficult to traverse",
