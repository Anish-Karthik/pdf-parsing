  "passage": "\tPassage 1\n\tI am a Jane Austenite, and, therefore, slightly imbecile about Jane Austen. My  fatuous expression and airs of personal  immunity\u2014how ill they set on the face, say, of a Stevensonian. But Jane Austen is so different. One\u2019s favorite author! One reads and re-reads, the mouth open and the mind closed. Shut up in measureless content, one greets her by the name of most kind hostess, while criticism slumbers. The Jane Austenite possesses none of the brightness he ascribes to his idol. Like all regular churchgoers, he scarcely notices what is being said. Passage 2\n\tJane Austen never suffered fools gladly, nor should we. Her letters and novels are filled with sharp, cutting comments\u2014zingers, remarks that startle, even shock, the unwary reader. At the ball there \u201cwas a scarcity of Men in general, & a still greater scarcity of any that were good for much.\u201d Zing! Who, reading that caustic comment, can ever again think of Austen as Gentle Jane? As Natalie Tyler says, \u201cShe is the one person whose insights about yourself you would most fear because you realize that her perceptions are penetrating, perspicacious, and piercingly accurate.\u201d",
  "header": "\tBoth passages relate to English author Jane Austen and her readers.  Passage 1 is taken from E. M. Forster\u2019s 1924 review of Chapman\u2019s edition, The Works of Jane Austen.  Passage 2 is taken from an article written in 2005. ",
