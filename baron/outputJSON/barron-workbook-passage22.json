  "passage": "\tPassage 1\n\tI can hardly understand the importance given to the word research in connection with modern painting. In my opinion to search means nothing in painting. To find, is the thing. Nobody is interested in following a man who, with his eyes fixed on the ground, spends his life looking for the pocketbook that fortune should put in his path. The one who finds something no matter what it might be, even if his intention were not to search for it, at least arouses our curiosity, if not our admiration. Among the several sins that I have been accused of committing, none is more false than the one that I have, as the principal objective in my work, the spirit of research. When I paint, my object is to show what I have found and not what I am looking for. In art intentions are not sufficient and, as we say in Spanish: love must be proved by facts and not by reasons. What one does is what counts and not what one had the intention of doing.  We all know that Art is not truth. Art is a lie that makes us realize truth, at least the truth that is given us to understand. The artist must know the manner whereby to convince others of the truthfulness of his lies. If he only shows in his work that he has searched, and researched, for the way to put over lies, he would never accomplish anything. The idea of research has often made painting go astray, and made the artist lose himself in mental lucubrations.1 Perhaps this has been the principal fault of modern art. The spirit of research had poisoned those who have not fully understood all the positive and conclusive elements in modern art and has made them attempt to paint the invisible and, therefore, the unpaintable.  They speak of naturalism in opposition to modern painting. I would like to know if anyone has ever seen a natural work of art. Nature\n\tand art, being two different things, cannot be the same thing. Through art we express our conception of what nature is not. 1Meditation; study. Passage 2\n\tCubism, with Picasso and Braque at its head, rejected the conventional notions of beauty. Discarding the world of perspectives and naturalism, they put in their place a new world obeying only the laws of the artist\u2019s inner vision. Picasso succeeded in freeing the technique of painting from its slavish adherence to the description of nature, and he gave it new laws of harmony and balance. This break with the past had far-reaching consequences. From then on the painter became a free creator, a poet. Through the break in the wall, poetry crept into painting, with all that is unusual, miraculous, and disturbing. Things around us which do not seem worthy of the artist\u2019s glance, things often considered ugly, were revealed in Picasso\u2019s pictures in their most ordinary essence but also in a new, extraordinary significance. \u201cI put into my pictures all the things I enjoy,\u201d said Picasso, and so he does, with his pipe, glass, packet of tobacco, and guitar. He is tireless in seeking to define the forms of these objects and their essential volume, transforming them into poetic images, and treating them freely and naturally as in daily life. In this connection Andr\u00e9 Breton wrote of Picasso: \u201cIt rested with a failure of the will of this man, and what we are concerned about would have been at least postponed, if not utterly lost.\u201d To which Paul Eluard added: \u201cYes, for this man held in his hands the fragile key to the problem of reality. He sought to see what he sees, to set vision free, to attain sight. He achieved this.\u201d Picasso considers art a process that is never completed; he studies the problem that interests him over and over again, from different angles. Thus he does not create pictures in the conventional, picture-gallery sense of the word; he does not seek, but finds, in the words of the aphorism attributed to him. The elemental side of his talent never allows him to rest content with what he has achieved. He is always interested exclusively in the present, in the picture on which he is working. \u201cEverything must be done anew, and not just patched up,\u201d he says, and these words sum up his  programme. The constant creativity which has no regard for the nature of anything he has painted before gives Picasso the freedom to move at will in the boundless spaces of free expression. It gives him the freedom to draw on all sources of inspiration for the most varied motifs, opening up all spheres of culture, contemporary, distant, or historic. Thus this restless, disturbing spirit, one of the most truthful witnesses to the conflict-torn century we live in, goes again and again into the attack on the gates of the unknown. Each new development in his art does more than merely increase the number of pictures he has painted: it turns against his very work itself, testing the foundations on which it rests. Picasso confounds his followers and turns inside out the aesthetic principles he himself has just established.",
