It\u2019s why we pasteurize our milk, and refrigerate our food. When they do make us sick, our ability to safely exterminate them is nothing short of a modern miracle. Beginning with penicillin in 1928, antibiotics forever transformed the way we both treat and prevent infectious disease. Today, moreover, one can stroll down any cleaning supply aisle at a supermarket, and discover a bevy of products boasting of their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.\n\tFor better or for worse, our culture of \u201cgermophobia\u201d was hard-won by its proponents. From the time it was first proposed in the 16th century, the germ theory of disease faced three hundred years\u2019 worth of influential naysayers, and it was not until the late 1800\u2019s that the theory began to gain the pervasive public vindication it enjoys today. However, an emerging body of research indicates that we have been perhaps overzealous in our crusade to eradicate the germs that live within us.\n\tThe \u201chuman microbiome\u201d refers collectively to the microscopic organisms that naturally colonize the human body, and the application of dynamic ecological theories to this biome represents a rapidly expanding field of study. Comprised of fungi, viruses, archaea, and perhaps 1,000 species of bacteria, the population of this microbiome is thought to outnumber our own cells by as much as ten to one. What\u2019s more, much like our own cells, a significant portion of these organisms play crucial roles in our metabolic and immunological processes.\n\tFor example, Oxalobacter formigenes, which colonizes the colon, is a primary source of the enzyme oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, which allows us to safely eliminate dietary oxalate. Without this enzyme, calcium oxalate salts tend to accumulate in the kidney tubules, and eventually precipitate as renal stones. Other colonic bacteria catalyze the reduction of bilirubin into urobilinogen: a reaction critical to our digestion of fats, and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Interestingly, many bacteria within our gastrointestinal tracts also directly synthesize several vitamins in excess of their own metabolic needs, and, as a result, represent an important source of both vitamin B12, which is necessary for the production of new red blood cells, and vitamin K, which is a cofactor in the synthesis of several blood clotting factors.\n\tThe benefits we gain from a balanced, thriving microbiome are diverse, and we are only just beginning to appreciate their true complexity, though perhaps no single function it serves is more significant than its role in regulating our immune systems. There are numerous mechanisms by which the microbiome helps protect us from disease. Some species, for instance, secrete special proteins, known as \u201cbacteriocins,\u201d that are directly toxic to pathogenic bacteria, but harmless to our own cells. One particularly impressive member of the microbiome, Lactobacillus, produces a powerful bacteriocin called reuterin, as well as lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, which inhibit the growth of disease causing organisms by lowering local pH and damaging lipid membranes respectively.\n\tOf no less importance, there are a number of more indirect, ecologically-oriented ways in which the microbiome confers protection to its host. Abundant colonization of our bodies by benign microorganisms, for example, inhibits the overgrowth of more dangerous ones through the sheer depletion of microbial nutrients. This notion of ecological balance has been of particular interest to scientists studying the microbiome, as it hinges upon both the variable diversity of species that colonize an individual, as well as factors that affect the dynamism of a microbiotic population. Age, geography, diet, and stress have all been implicated in influencing both the composition and balance of the microbiome. None, however, has been shown to have so drastic an effect as the use of antibiotics, which, unlike bacteriocins, tend to be just as deadly to disease-causing bacteria as they are to those that colonize us naturally.\n\tAdmittedly, antibiotics save lives. Yet our decision to use them must be weighed carefully, as artificially upsetting the ecological balance of our bodies can have dire consequences. There is perhaps no greater example of this than Clostridium difficile, a colonic bacterium that is both highly resistant to antibiotics, and an increasing cause of hospital-acquired disease. When properly counterbalanced by its neighboring species, C. difficile is harmless to humans. However, following the administration of antibiotics, and the elimination of its ecological competitors, C. diff proliferation proceeds unchecked, resulting in a frequently fatal infection for which very few effective treatments exist. The table illustrates variations in microbiota for individuals following either vegetarian or omnivorous diets across three geographical demographics.\n\tDiversity of Human Microbiomes.",
