  "passage": "\tPassage 1\n\tWith cries of delight and occasional tears, ornithologists around the world celebrated the sighting in Arkansas of the ivory-billed woodpecker.\n\tLong thought to be extinct, the ivorybill was first sighted in February of 2004 by a kayaker in Big Woods country. Later visual encounters seemed to corroborate the original sighting, but doubt remained until one sighting was captured on video. Despite the blurred, grainy quality of the footage, the team of Cornell researchers identified the woodpecker by its size, markings, and characteristic plumage. To bird-lovers, the rediscovery of the ivory-bill seems miraculous, \u201calmost like finding Elvis,\u201d and they are grateful for a second chance to protect this unique bird and the Big Woods in which it lives.\n\t Passage 2\n\tAlthough the public appears to be taking the ivory-billed woodpecker\u2019s rediscovery as fact, much skepticism still exists among birdwatchers unconvinced by the Cornell Ornithology Laboratory\u2019s video and audio recordings that the ivory-bill lives. Even the Cornell scientists have begun to hedge.\n\tAccording to Cornell\u2019s Russell Charif, \u201cOur interpretation of these data is that they provide suggestive and tantalizing, but not conclusive, new evidence of living ivory-bills in this region.\u201d Unfortunately, the ivory-billed woodpecker controversy is not just a philosophical debate\u2014it has real-world implications as well.\n\tThe Department of the Interior has earmarked $10 million to preserve the ivory-bill\u2019s habitat; that means $10 million less available to protect other species, such as the Kirtland\u2019s  warbler.",
