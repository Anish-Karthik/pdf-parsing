  "passage": "\tIs It the Heart or the Brain? I saw you from across the room, and I knew immediately. My pulse began to race; I started to sweat; I could barely breathe. From the first moment that I laid eyes on you, I was convinced that you were the one. On our first date, the chemistry was obvious. We laughed and smiled and held hands and talked for hours. I couldn\u2019t sleep or eat or even pay attention at work. I just had to be with you\n\tWithin one-fifth of a second, your physical appearance and body language caused an excessive release of dopamine in my brain creating feelings of excitement and happiness. We made eye contact for 8.2 seconds; your pheromones were indistinguishable from my mother\u2019s. Then, your voice triggered my brain mechanism for generating long-term attachment; and, for the next several days, my neurotransmitters sent obsessive message after message, accompanying thoughts of you with feelings of euphoria. Once vasopressin and oxytocin reached my receptors, I knew that I could never be without you\n\tAlthough the former description of \u201cfalling in love\u201d is far more prevalent, it is the latter that has scientists speculating that love is more biological than cultural. Helen Fisher, American anthropologist and professor at Rutgers University, studies romantic interpersonal attraction and states that love begins with a focus on one person that results in obsessive thinking. In her essay, \u201cThe Realities of Love at First Sight,\u201d Fisher explains how we evaluate an individual within three minutes of meeting them based on their physical attributes, voice, and words. First, we decide if they are attractive, then we evaluate their clothing and stature, before moving on to the sound and tone of their voice. Lastly, we consider what they actually say. She concludes that we choose partners whose biological chemicals complement our own\n\tFisher\u2019s research has even gone further to explain the science behind falling in love. She theorizes that humans have three brain systems for loving: lust, which is associated with testosterone; attraction, which is linked to dopamine; and attachment, which is brought on by increased levels of oxytocin and vasopressin. While these three systems can surely overlap, they also exist separately from one another which, for Fisher, explains why loving more than one person at a time is quite possible. However, Fisher isn\u2019t convinced that love is entirely biological. The Economist describes the phenomenon like this: \u201ca chemical state with genetic roots and environmental influences.\u201d\n\tYet, the connection between love and brain chemicals is far too certain to ignore Psychology Today renders love a three-step scientific process. First, a release of the hormone dopamine causes \u201cfeel good\u201d emotions. In this stage, we feel attracted to an individual and associate them with feelings of intense joy. Next, our neurotransmitters\u2014 norepinephrine and phenylethylamine\u2014lead to focused attention on the object of our attraction and feelings of giddiness that make it hard to sleep and decrease our appetite. Lastly, our brain reward system is activated, sending chemical messages to various parts of the body that elevate mood and make an addiction-like urge to be with that person. Biologically, that is the extent of love\n\tComparing love to a chemical addiction is actually a quite common metaphor, within poetry and music, but it also happens within the sciences. Deepak Chopra, physician and public speaker, postulates that love stems from an impulse and behaves within our brain very similarly to a drug addiction. Stephanie Ortigue is a professor at Syracuse University and describes the addiction-like qualities as a result of twelve different areas of the brain working in tandem to release euphoria-inducing chemicals such as adrenaline, dopamine, oxytocin, and vasopressin. Oxytocin, known as \u201cthe love hormone,\u201d is why we feel calm and cuddly with our significant others\n\tWhen it comes to \u201clove at first sight,\u201d biologists are asserting that it actually does happen\u2014in about 11% of love encounters, the attachment mechanism within the brain can be triggered within the first few minutes of meeting someone. The Huffington Post contends that the optimal environment for love at first sight takes place in encounters with about 8 seconds of continuous eye contact; in cases where individuals stared into one another\u2019s eyes for 4.5 seconds or less, the chances for love were dismal. It would appear that new research has love down to a science\n\tWhen Did I Fall in Love?.",
