  "passage": "\tBelow is the beginning of Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s 1852 novel, Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. Her own remark on the chapter is as follows: \u201cin which the reader is introduced to a man of humanity.\u201d\n\tLate in the afternoon of a chilly day in February two gentlemen were sitting over their wine, in a well-furnished parlour in the town of P---- in Kentucky in the midst of an earnest conversation\n\t\u201cThat is the way I should arrange the matter,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, the owner of the place. \u201cThe fact is, Tom is an uncommon fellow; he is certainly worth that sum anywhere; steady, honest, capable, manages my farm like a clock. You ought to let him cover the whole of the debt; and you would, Haley, if you\u2019d got any conscience.\u201d\n\t\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got just as much conscience as any man in business can afford to keep,\u201d said Haley, \u201cand I\u2019m willing to do anything to \u2018blige friends; but this yer, ye see, is too hard on a feller, it really is. Haven\u2019t you a boy or gal you could thrown in with Tom?\u201d \u201cHum!\u2014none that I could well spare; to tell the truth, it\u2019s only hard necessity makes me sell at all.\u201d Here the door opened, and a small quadroon boy, remarkably beautiful and engaging, entered with a comic air of assurance which showed he was used to being petted and noticed by his master. \u201cHulloa, Jim Crow,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, snapping a bunch of raisins towards him, \u201cpick that up, now!\u201d The child scampered, with all his little strength after the prize, while his master laughed. \u201cTell you what,\u201d said Haley, \u201cfling in that chap, and I\u2019ll settle the business, I will.\u201d\n\tAt this moment a young woman, obviously the child\u2019s mother, came in search of him, and Haley, as soon as she had carried him away, turned to Mr. Shelby in admiration\n\t\u201cBy Jupiter!\u201d said the trader, \u201cthere\u2019s an article now! You might make your fortune on that one gal in Orleans, any way. What shall I say for her? What\u2019ll you take?\u201d\n\t\u201cMr. Haley, she is not to be sold. I say no, and I mean no,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, decidedly\n\t\u201cWell, you\u2019ll let me have the boy, though.\u201d\n\t\u201cI would rather not sell him,\u201d said Mr Shelby; \u201cthe fact is, I\u2019m a humane man, and I hate to take the boy from his mother, sir.\u201d\n\t\u201cOh, you do? La, yes, I understand perfectly It is mighty unpleasant getting on with women sometimes. I al\u2019ays hates these yer screechin\u2019 times. As I manages business, I generally avoids \u2018em, sir. Now, what if you get the gal off for a day or so? then the thing\u2019s done quietly. It\u2019s always best to do the humane thing, sir; that\u2019s been my experience.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to have been able to kick the fellow down the steps,\u201d said Mr. Shelby to himself, when the trader had bowed himself out. \u201cAnd Eliza\u2019s child, too! I know I shall have some fuss with the wife about that, and for that matter, about Tom, too! So much for being in debt, heigho!\u201d\n\tThe prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin had been protracted to a very late hour, and Tom and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep, when between twelve and one there was a light tap on the window pane\n\t\u201cGood Lord! what\u2019s that?\u201d said Aunt Chloe, starting up. \u201cMy sakes alive, if it aint Lizzy! Get on your clothes, old man, quick. I\u2019m gwine to open the door.\u201d And suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light of the candle which Tom had hastily lighted, fell on the face of Eliza. \u201cI\u2019m running away, Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe\u2014carrying off my child. Master sold him.\u201d\n\t\u201cSold him?\u201d echoed both, holding up their hands in dismay\n\t\u201cYes, sold him!\u201d said Eliza firmly. \u201cI crept into the closet by mistress\u2019s door to-night, and I heard master tell missus that he had sold my Harry and you, Uncle Tom, both to a trader, and that the man was to take possession to-day.\u201d\n\tSlowly, as the meaning of this speech came over Tom, he collapsed on his old chair, and sunk his head on his knees",
