  "passage": "\tIn the shifting relationship between the press and the presidency over nearly two centuries, there has remained one primary constant\u2014the dissatisfaction of one with the other. No president has escaped press criticism, and no president has considered himself fairly treated. The record of every administration has been the same, beginning with mutual protestations of goodwill, ending with recriminations and mistrust.\n\tThis is the best proof we could have that the American concept of a free press in a free society is a viable idea, whatever defects the media may have. While the Founding Fathers and their constituencies did not always agree on the role the press should play, there was a basic consensus that the newspaper (the only medium of consequence at the time) should be the buffer state between the rulers and the ruled.\n\tThe press could be expected to behave like a watchdog, and government at every level, dependent for its existence on the opinions of those it governed, could expect to resent being watched and having its shortcomings, real or imaginary, exposed to the public view.\n\tReduced to such simple terms, the relationship of the presidents to the press since George Washington\u2019s first term is understandable only as an underlying principle. But this basic concept has been increasingly complicated by the changing nature of the presidency, by the individual nature of presidents, by the rise of other media, especially television, and by the growing complexity of beliefs about the function of both press and government.\n\tIn surveying nearly two centuries of this relationship, it is wise to keep in mind an axiom of professional historians\u2014that we should be careful not to view the past in terms of our own times, and make judgments accordingly. Certain parallels often become obvious, to be sure, but to assert what an individual president should or should not have\n\tdone, by present standards, is to violate historical context. Historians occasionally castigate each other for this failing, and in the case of press and government, the danger becomes particularly great because the words themselves\u2014\u201cpress\u201d and \u201cgovernment,\u201d even \u201cpresidency\u201d\u2014have changed in meaning so much during the past two hundred years.\n\tRecent scholarship, for example, has emphasized that colonial Americans believed in a free press, but not QS$$5 at all in the sense that we understand it today. Basic to QE$$5 their belief was the understanding, which had prevailed since the invention of the printing press in the fifteenth century, that whoever controlled the printing press was in the best position to control the minds of men. The press was seen at once as an unprecedented instrument of power, and the struggle to control it began almost as soon as the Gutenberg (or Mazarin) Bible appeared at Mainz in 1456, an event which meant that, for the first time, books could be reproduced exactly and, more important, that they could be printed in quantity.\n\tTwo primary centers of social and political power\u2014the state and the church\u2014stood to benefit most from the invention of the printing press. In the beginning it was mutually advantageous for them to work together; consequently it was no accident that the QS$$7 first printing press on the North American continent QE$$7 was set up in Mexico City in 1539 by Fray Juan Zumarraga, first Catholic bishop of that country. It gave the church an unprecedented means of advancing conversion, along with the possibility of consolidating and extending its power, thus providing Catholic Spain with the same territorial advantages that would soon be extended elsewhere in the Americas.\n\tWhen British colonies were established in North America during the early part of the seventeenth century, it was once again a religious faith, this time Protestant, that brought the first printing press to what is now the United States. But while colonial printing in Central and South America remained the province of the Catholics for some time and was used primarily for religious purposes, in North America secular publishing became an adjunct of a church-dominated press almost at once and was soon dominant.\n\tIt is part of American mythology that the nation was \u201ccradled in liberty\u201d and that the colonists, seeking religious freedom, immediately established a free society, but the facts are quite different. The danger of an uncontrolled press to those in power was well expressed by Sir William Berkeley, governor of Virginia, when he wrote home to his superiors in 1671: \u201cI thank God there are no free schools nor printing, and I hope we shall not have these hundred years; for learning has brought disobedience, and heresy, and sects into the world, and printing has divulged them, and libels against the best government, God keep us from both.\u201d There are those in twentieth-century America who would say \u201cAmen\u201d to Berkeley\u2019s view QS$$10 of printing and \u201clibels against QE$$10 the best government.\u201d",
