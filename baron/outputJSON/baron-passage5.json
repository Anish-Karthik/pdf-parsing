It\u2019s mind-boggling to consider all of the implications of traveling through time and having free will. It\u2019s easy to see that the universe as we know it would be rather unstable if, for instance, you could travel backwards in time and kill your own grandfather But is it possible?\n\tTo begin to understand the possibilities of time, we first need a brief introduction of spacetime. We\u2019re all familiar with our three-dimensional world, but we need to consider a fourth dimension as well\u2014time. Time passes. Therefore, you can sit still in a chair not traveling in three-dimensions, but traveling in spacetime. We think of time as passing forward. Stephen Hawking explains this as three \u201carrows of time\u201d. The thermodynamic arrow of time points from a time of low entropy (high organization) to a time of high entropy (low organization/high chaos). It passes from a glass of water sitting on a table to a shattered glass and a puddle of water on the floor. There\u2019s a psychological arrow of time: we remember the past, but not the future. Finally, there\u2019s a cosmological arrow of time. The universe is expanding (though this arrow could reverse in the future).\n\tWe tend to think of time as an absolute: there are 60 seconds in every minute, and my 60 seconds should be the same as your 60 seconds. However, Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity defies this with time dilation. When a body approaches the speed of light, time effectively slows down. Therefore, if observers traveling at different fractions of the speed of light were to hold clocks, the clocks would be ticking at different speeds. Time is relative to the observer, rather than absolute. Consider what\u2019s referred to as the twin paradox: one identical twin stays on earth and the other travels near the speed of light in a spaceship. The twin aboard the spaceship will experience time dilation, and thus will age less quickly than the twin at home. Furthermore, if the twin\u2019s journey were long enough, the twin could return to earth to find that everyone he or she once knew was long dead. Essentially, this would be traveling into the future\n\tThis isn\u2019t the exciting kind of time travel from the sci-fi books and movies, though We would prefer our time travel to be instantaneous and not limited to the future. So far, we\u2019ve examined only linear time travel in the form of slowing time down. But does time have to pass linearly? Is it possible that there could be loops in spacetime leading to the past and future? One possible candidate for such travel is the presence of worm- holes. While wormholes also seem the stuff of sci-fi, their basis is actually in a paper written by Einstein and Nathan Rosen, where they refer to \u201cbridges\u201d in spacetime. They believed bridges to be extremely unstable and thus only temporary. The idea behind these bridges/wormholes is that there are theoretical tunnels between two far apart locations in spacetime. The distance of the wormhole wouldn\u2019t necessarily have to correspond to the distance between the two locations. There is evidence that such wormholes could theoretically exist, but that is beyond the scope of this paper. We\u2019ll suffice it to say that even if we find such wormholes, we\u2019d have to figure out how to stabilize them in order to utilize them for time travel\n\tStephen Hawking currently believes time travel into the past to be impossible for many reasons. One less than scientific reason is that humans tend to love \u201cspilling the beans.\u201d If someone in the future had figured out how to time travel into the past, he or she likely would have traveled back and told us! So will we eventually be able to time travel without limit? I can\u2019t say; my psychological arrow of time doesn\u2019t point that way. Oh well, it\u2019s all relative anyway.",
