  "passage": "\n\tI must have been about ten years old when I went to Miss Havisham\u2019s, and first met Estella.\n\tMy uncle Pumblechook, who kept a cornchandler\u2019s shop in the high-street of the town, took me to the large old, dismal house, which had all its windows barred. For miles round everybody had heard of Miss Havisham as an immensely rich and grim lady who led a life of seclusion; and everybody soon knew that Mr. Pumblechook had been commissioned to bring her a boy.\n\tHe left me at the courtyard, and a young lady, who was very pretty and seemed very proud, let me in, and I noticed that the passages were all dark, and that there was a candle burning. My guide, who called me \u201cboy,\u201d but was really about my own age, was as scornful of me as if she had been one-and-twenty, and a queen. She led me to Miss Havisham\u2019s room, and there, in an armchair, with her elbow resting on the table, sat the strangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.\n\tShe was dressed in rich materials\u2014satins and lace and silks\u2014all of white\u2014or rather, which had been white, but, like all else in the room, were now faded yellow. Her shoes were white, and she had a long white veil dependent from her hair, and bridal flowers in her hair; but her hair was white. I saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress.\n\t\u201cWho is it?\u201d said the lady at the table.\n\t\u201cPip, ma\u2019am. Mr. Pumblechook\u2019s boy.\u201d\n\t\u201cCome nearer; let me look at you; come close. You are not afraid of a woman who has never seen the sun since you were born?\u201d\n\t\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\t\u201cDo you know what I touch here?\u201d she said, laying her hands, one upon the other, on her left side.\n\t\u201cYes, ma\u2019am; your heart.\u201d\n\t\u201cBroken!\u201d She was silent for a little while, and then added, \u201cI am tired; I want diversion. Play, play, play!\u201d\n\tWhat was an unfortunate boy to do? I didn\u2019t know how to play.\n\t\u201cCall Estella,\u201d said the lady. \u201cCall Estella, at the door.\u201d\n\tIt was a dreadful thing to be bawling \u201cEstella\u201d to a scornful young lady in a mysterious passage in an unknown house, but I had to do it. And Estella came, and I heard her say, in answer to Miss Havisham, \u201cPlay with this boy! Why, he is a common labouring boy!\u201d\n\tI thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer, \u201cWell? You can break his heart.\u201d\n\tWe played at beggar my neighbour, and before the game was out Estella said disdainfully, \u201cHe calls the knaves Jacks, this boy! And what coarse hands he has! And what thick boots!\u201d\n\tI was very glad to get away. My coarse hands and my common boots had never troubled me before; but they troubled me now, and I determined to ask Joe why he had taught me to call those picture cards Jacks which ought to be called knaves.\n\tFor a long time I went once a week to this strange, gloomy house\u2014it was called Satis House\u2014and once Estella told me I might kiss her.\n\tAnd then Miss Havisham decided I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and gave him \u00a325 for the purpose; and I left off going to see her, and helped Joe in the forge. But I didn\u2019t like Joe\u2019s trade, and I was afflicted by that most miserable thing\u2014to feel ashamed of home.\n\tI couldn\u2019t resist paying Miss Havisham a visit; and, not seeing Estella, stammered that I hoped she was well.\n\t\u201cAbroad,\u201d said Miss Havisham; \u201ceducating for a lady; far out of reach; prettier than ever; admired by all who see her. Do you feel that you have lost her?\u201d\n\tI was spared the trouble of answering by being dismissed, and went home dissatisfied and uncomfortable, thinking myself coarse and common, and wanting to be a gentleman.",
