He did not wish all that was characteristic in his countenance to be lost, in a vain attempt to give him regular features and smooth cheeks. He was content that his face should show all the blemishes put on it by time, by war, by sleepless nights, by anxiety, perhaps by remorse; but with valor, policy, authority, and public care written on it as  well. If great men knew what was in their best interests, it is thus that they would wish their minds to be portrayed.  1Oliver Cromwell led the forces of Parliament during England\u2019s Civil Wars; he was Lord Protector of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1653 to 1658 during the republican Commonwealth.",
