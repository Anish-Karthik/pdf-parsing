Marine biologists have long dreamed of QE$$0 observing these reputedly lethargic creatures of the deep in their native habitat. Now a team of Japanese scientists has managed to film a giant squid aggressively attacking its prey at a depth of 3,000 feet. The race to film the giant squid is over. QE$$1",
