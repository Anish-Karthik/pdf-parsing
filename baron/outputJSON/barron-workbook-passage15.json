  "passage": "\tWhenever I succeeded in the Hakujin world, my brothers were supportive, whereas Papa would be disdainful, undermined by my obvious capitulation to the ways of the West. I wanted to be like my Caucasian friends. Not only did I want to look like them, I wanted to act like them. I tried hard to be outgoing and socially aggressive and act confidently, like my girlfriends. At home I was careful not to show these personality traits to my father. For him it was bad enough that I did not even look Japanese: I was too big, and I walked too assertively. My behavior at home was never calm and serene, but around my father I still tried to be as Japanese as I could.\n\tAs I passed puberty and grew more interested in boys, I soon became aware that an Oriental female evoked a certain kind of interest from males. I was still too young to understand how or why an Oriental female fascinated Caucasian men, and of course, far too young QS$$3 to see then that it was a form of \u201cnot seeing.\u201d QE$$3 QS$$3 My brothers would warn me, \u201cDon\u2019t trust QE$$3 the Hakujin boys. They only want one thing. They\u2019ll treat you like a servant and expect you to wait on them hand and foot.\n\tThey don\u2019t even know how to be nice to you.\u201d My brothers never dated Caucasian girls. In fact, I never really dated Caucasian boys until I went to college. In high school, I used to sneak out to dances and parties where I would meet them. I wouldn\u2019t even dare to think what Papa would do if he knew.\n\tWhat my brothers were saying was that I should not act toward Caucasian males as I did\n\ttoward them. I must not \u201cwait on them\u201d or allow them to think I would, because they wouldn\u2019t understand. In other words, be a Japanese female around Japanese men and act as a Hakujin around QS$$4 Caucasian men. The double identity within a \u201cdouble QE$$4 QS$$4 standard\u201d resulted not only in confusion QE$$4 for me of my role, or roles, as a female, but also in who or what I was racially. With the admonitions of my brothers lurking deep in my consciousness, I would try to be aggressive, assertive and \u201ccome on strong\u201d toward Caucasian men. I mustn\u2019t let them think QS$$5 I was submissive, passive, and all-giving like Madame QE$$5 QS$$5 Butterfly.\n\tWith Asian males I would QE$$5 tone down my natural enthusiasm and settle into patterns instilled in me through the models of my mother and sisters. I was not comfortable in either role.",
