  "passage": "\tAn English professor and a Master of Fine Arts candidate share their thoughts on literary standards.\n\tPASSAGE 1\n\tThere is and must remain a standard by which good writing is measured and acknowledged. Take a moment to consider the alternative, and you\u2019ll surely come to agree with me. Without standard, anything and everything could be considered \u201cliterature.\u201d More so, it would change from person to person and place to place based solely on the rudimentary preference of varied individuals. Without a clear idea of what is meant by \u201cliterary,\u201d all writing is a chaotic mess of opinion and idiosyncratic interest with genre romance being just as viable as those rare works of art that embody the human experience, raise significant social and political questions, and remain in the readers\u2019 minds long after the book is finished. Without measure, the Twilight series sits right next to the works of Toni Morrison.\n\tLet us think about what makes important writing. Writing, like all great forms of art, has the power to make us see the world more clearly. It is, when done effectively, a carrier of history and truth, a script of humanity that can be felt. It is lasting, or as Ezra Pound once remarked, \u201cnews that stays news.\u201d And it moves us. What I mean is that literature plays with the big questions, searches for the big things. It pursues beauty, purpose, and meaning in an aesthetic way that arouses emotion. The canon is acknowledged as superior and of artistic merit not because everyone likes reading the stuff, but because it heightens our understanding of life and rattles our comfort levels.\n\tIn essence, reading literature makes us better humans, and certainly, not all writing can do that. To say that writing cannot be measured or that there is not a clear standard is absurd. While you may not like everything deemed \u201cliterary,\u201d it surely has the power to make you think and feel and wonder. It is this exploration of universal truths that intensifies our understanding of humanity and stirs something deep within us that makes literature. While you may laugh or cry or shout while reading Harry Potter, that in itself cannot classify it as one of the greats. PASSAGE 2\n\tI used to revel at my anxiety after turning in an assignment in my first years of my Creative Writing degree. One moment, I was quite sure that my work was genius. And another, I was the most dim-witted simpleton to ever put pen to paper. I had absolutely no idea whether my fiction would come back with an \u201cA\u201d or an \u201cF\u201d stamped on it\u2014no clue how the professor might decide between the two. Often, I\u2019d pull decent grades, but moan aloud when the instructor picked out my very favorite sentence\u2014the one that was going to mark me the next V onnegut or Kerouac\u2014and crossed it out in red ink. Rethink this she\u2019d scribble underneath. It took me two years and the onset of carpal tunnel to realize that there is no real way to know what\u2019s good, and that what\u2019s good is entirely subjective.\n\tTo test my theory, I submitted a few poems from previous semesters (highly frowned upon by the university, but necessary for my experiment) in hopes of getting a second opinion. I found that my grades varied only imperceptibly, but more interestingly, instructor feedback bordered on polarity. And so, I realized there is no true standard of measurement for writing, not creative writing at least. Once you venture past the \u201cthesis statement\u201d and \u201clogical reasoning\u201d and \u201ccoherent organization\u201d of the purely academic writing, the concession on what is good is really nonexistent.\n\tSure, we might be able to agree that something particularly terrible is just that, and we might be able to nod our heads to a piece that is particularly brilliant and say that, at the very least, it isn\u2019t terrible. But overall, many will adore language that others detest, and some will gasp appreciatively at a metaphor that makes the masses vomit. I find enchanting what you find dull, and so it goes. And Mary Wright (fall semester) will find the same image \u201cineffective,\u201d which Tobias Dalton (spring semester) calls \u201cdelightful and provocative.\u201d And so I say, to each their own. What is thoughtful, good, and stirring is without impartiality, contingent not only on the reader, but the reader\u2019s mood, location, and even on what the reader has recently read. Therefore, write what you will and read what you wish, and if you like it, then declare with authority that it is indeed exceptional..",
