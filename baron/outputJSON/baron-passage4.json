  "passage": "\tMr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of Congress, honored guests, and fellow citizens: Only a month ago I was your guest in this historic building, and I pledged to you my cooperation in doing what is right for this Nation that we all love so much. I\u2019m here tonight to reaffirm that pledge and to ask that we share in restoring the promise that is offered to every citizen by this, the last, best hope of man on Earth.\n\tAll of us are aware of the punishing inflation which has for the first time in 60 years held to double-digit figures for 2 years in a row. Interest rates have reached absurd levels more than 20 percent and over 15 percent for those who would borrow to buy a home. All across this land one can see newly built homes standing vacant, unsold because of mortgage interest rates.\n\tAlmost 8 million Americans are out of work. These are people who want to be productive. But as the months go by, despair dominates their lives. The threats of layoff and unemployment hang over other millions, and all who work are frustrated by their inability to keep up with inflation.\n\tOne worker in a Midwest city put it to me this way: He said, \u201cI\u2019m bringing home more dollars than I ever believed I could possibly earn, but I seem to be getting worse off.\u201d And he is. Not only have hourly earnings the American worker, after adjusting for inflation, declined 5 percent over the past 5 years, but in these 5 years, federal personal taxes for the average family have increased 67 percent. We can no longer procrastinate and hope that things will get better. They will not. Unless we act forcefully\u2014and now\u2014the economy will get worse.\n\tCan we, who man the ship of state, deny it is somewhat out of control? Our national debt is approaching $1 trillion. A few weeks ago I called such a figure, a trillion dollars, incomprehensible, and I\u2019ve been trying ever since to think of a way to illustrate how big a trillion really is. And the best I could come up with is that if you had a stack of thousand dollar bills in your hand only 4 inches high, you\u2019d be a millionaire. A trillion dollars would be a stack of thousand-dollar bills 67 miles high. The interest on the public debt this year we know will be over $90 billion, and unless we change the proposed spending for the fiscal year beginning October 1st, we\u2019ll add another almost $80 billion to the debt.\n\tAdding to our troubles is a mass of regulations imposed on the shopkeeper, the farmer, the craftsman, professionals, and major industry that is estimated to add $100 billion to the price of the things we buy, and it reduces our ability to produce. The rate of increase in American productivity, once one of the highest in the world, is among the lowest of all major industrial nations. Indeed, it has actually declined in the last 3 years.\n\tNow, I\u2019ve painted a pretty grim picture, but I think I\u2019ve painted it accurately. It is within our power to change this picture, and we can act with hope. There\u2019s nothing wrong with our internal strengths. There has been no breakdown of the human, technological, and natural resources upon which the economy is built. This, then, is our proposal\u2014America\u2019s new beginning: a program for economic recovery. I don\u2019t want it to be simply the plan of my administration. I\u2019m here tonight to ask you to join me in making it our plan. Together we can embark on this road..",
