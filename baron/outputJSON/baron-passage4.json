  "passage": "\tTwo scientists present their views on corn syrup \n\tPASSAGE 1 \n\tSince coming to a head in 2004, the high fructose corn syrup crisis and its role in the emergent obesity epidemic has faced unwavering denial from the food industry; yet the efforts to defend the additive on scientific grounds have been dubious at best. We are all familiar with the pitiful syllogism: corn syrup comes from corn, and corn is natural; corn syrup, therefore, is natural. However true this may be, it provides no proof whatsoever as to corn syrup\u2019s safety for human consumption. Solanine, for example, is easily extracted from potatoes, and while harmless in smaller amounts, once concentrated it becomes a potent and potentially deadly neurotoxin But I digress. Let us not look to the source of corn syrup to determine its nutritional demerit, but turn instead to its direct metabolic effects on our bodies Under ideal circumstances, the vast majority of sugar in our blood is derived from starch, which is broken into glucose before being released to the bloodstream Glycolysis is the name applied to ten sequential chemical reactions that allow us to either liberate energy from glucose, or transform it into fats for storage in adipose tissue. Gluconeogenesis, meanwhile, is an opposite process in which glucose is derived from non-carbohydrate substances, and a close and efficient regulation of the balance between glycolytic and gluconeogenic processes in response to the changing concentrations of glucose in the blood is necessary for the maintenance of healthful homeostasis \n\tBy far the most critical point in this regulation occurs at the third step of glycolysis: in the hormonally-controlled phosphorylation of fructose-6-phospate into fructose- 1,6-bisphospate. When glucose is abundant, pancreatic insulin induces the forward glycolytic catalysis of this reaction, allowing the production of fructose-1,6-bisphospate, which in turn is cleaved into glyceraldehyde- 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. When glucose is scarce, pancreatic glucagon blocks glycolysis, and induces the gluconeogenic production of fructose- 6-phosphate, which is subsequently isomerized into glucose-6-phosphate, and released into the blood \n\tThe primary problem, therefore, with deriving major amounts of dietary sugar directly from fructose rather than from starch lies in the fact that the degradation of fructose\u2014which, upon entry into the cell, is split immediately into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde\u2014completely bypasses the first four steps of glycolysis, including the most critical regulatory reaction in the entire process. Thus, how our bodies handle the usage of fructose is utterly dissociated from the hormonal controls of insulin and glucagon, which, over time, invariably predisposes one to obesity, diabetes mellitus, and a host of other dangerous metabolic disorders PASSAGE 2 \n\tThe media frenzy and public outcry that have surrounded the use of high fructose corn syrup as a food additive are as unfounded as the similarly nonsensical indignations that erupted in response to the advent of commercially available genetically modified crop seeds. Despite ongoing proof that genetically modified crops are not only perfectly safe for consumption, but that they have in fact saved an estimated 600 million people from starvation over the past two decades, fears and skepticism toward them persist simply because they are popularly perceived as \u201cunnatural,\u201d and thus, somehow, unhealthy \n\tThese same misguided apprehensions have been at the forefront of the crusade against high fructose corn syrup. Yet, in reality, the process of producing corn syrup is strikingly similar to the carbohydrate metabolism that occurs naturally within the human body. First, corn starch is broken down into glucose by bacterial amylase enzymes, and glucose is subsequently converted to fructose via glucose isomerase. Overall, the recipe is hardly as sinister as its opponents would have us believe \n\tWe must acknowledge, of course, that research has identified several serious health risks associated with the chronic overconsumption of sugar, and perhaps of fructose in particular. These risks, however, are by no means limited to foodstuffs containing high fructose corn syrup. Depending on the formula, corn syrup contains between 42% and 55% fructose by volume. For comparison, cane sugar, honey, and agave nectar\u2014three popular sweeteners touted as \u201cnatural\u201d, and therefore, more healthful\u2014contain 50%, 52%, and 85% fructose, respectively. Thus, while it is true that fructose should be consumed only in moderation, the singling out of products that contain high fructose corn syrup is not merely insufficient action to curb the fructose-associated obesity epidemic in our country, it\u2019s also patently misleading to consumers",
