Why do we bother with cooking meat? For one, it kills the bacteria that can live in meat and be harmful to us. But additionally, it makes the meat much more tender\u2014easier to eat and easier to digest Typically, protein is the second-highest component of meat behind water. Proteins have several levels of organization. A protein\u2019s primary structure is the order in which the amino acids are joined by their peptide bonds. A protein\u2019s secondary structure is made up of local interactions of the primary structure. Secondary structure includes alpha helices, beta sheets, turns, and loops. Tertiary structure is formed when various secondary structures interact, typically over long distances. Finally, quaternary structure is the interaction of different protein subunits. Proteins fold tightly in complex ways that are energetically and sterically favorable. So what happens to this complex organization when meat is heated? These interactions become weaker. Proteins denature, meaning their interactions weaken and their quaternary, tertiary, and secondary structures break down. Instead of tightly folded proteins, they become loose and stretched out. This denaturation is what makes meat more tender. However, continuing to cook meat after this initial denaturation serves only to remove water, making the meat tougher and drier. In particular, the denaturation of collagen makes meat more tender. Collagen is the most abundant protein in animal connective tissue. Tougher cuts of meat tend to have more connective tissue, and thus more collagen \n\tBut heating proteins isn\u2019t the only way to denature them: they can also be denatured by adding certain denaturing substances. Many of these substances, like strong acids and bases, you wouldn\u2019t want to add to your food; however, one common denaturing agent is salt. This is why you may want to brine a tougher cut of meat in addition to cooking it. Brining involves soaking something in a solution of salt water Another benefit of brining is that when the meat absorbs the salt, this draws water into the meat to dilute the salt. Thus, brining also serves to keep meat moist. Some chefs will advise searing the outside of a cut of meat before cooking it through to lock in the moisture. However, chemistry doesn\u2019t support this approach: steam is equally capable of escaping through a seared crust as it is through non-seared meat \n\tIf you\u2019ve ever cooked red meat, you know that as it cooks, it turns brown. Red meat is red because of its high myoglobin content. Myoglobin is an oxygen-storing protein found in muscle cells. It is associated with an iron atom. Before the meat is cooked, the iron atom is in the +2 oxidation state. Cooking it removes an electron, thus changing it to the +3 oxidation state. This transforms the color to brown. On the other hand, white meat doesn\u2019t turn brown because it doesn\u2019t have nearly as much myoglobin to be oxidized \n\tWe rarely pause mid-recipe to consider the chemistry of cooking, but understanding the chemical reactions occurring in our food will help us to become better cooks. Isn\u2019t that some food for thought? \n\tMean Percent Yield of Meat Cooked Under Different Methods",
