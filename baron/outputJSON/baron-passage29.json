Y oung, \u201cPathogenesis of Hemoglobinopathies.\u201d\n\tThere are few biochemical compounds as familiar to us as hemoglobin, and as the primary transporter of oxygen in our blood, the celebrity of this curious little compound is not without just cause. Vital to almost every known vertebrate, hemoglobin appears within the very first week of embryogenesis, and while its role may not change throughout development, its molecular structure undergoes a series of significant transformations.\n\tWithin the red blood cell, hemoglobin exists as a four-subunit complex, or \u201ctetramer,\u201d each subunit of which is made up of one \u201cheme\u201d metalloprotein, and one of several varieties of \u201cglobin.\u201d Comprised of iron and a carbon-nitrogen ring, heme is responsible for both the oxygen-binding capacity of hemoglobin, and for the red coloration of blood. Globin, meanwhile, refers to a folded chain of polypeptides, and it is the combination of these chains that imparts each type of hemoglobin with its unique characteristics.\n\tIn humans, six globin chains are expressed sequentially throughout development. Embryonic hemoglobin, or HbE, is composed of two \u03b6 chains and two \u03b5 chains, both of which are expressed exclusively during the embryonic period. In the fetal period, another tetramer of two \u03b1 chains and two \u03b3 chains emerges, and persists for the first six months of postnatal life. Due to its high affinity for binding gases, this fetal hemoglobin, or HbF, is able to extract oxygen from low-affinity maternal hemoglobin, and thus plays a crucial role in the oxygenation of fetal tissues. Like HbF, the final two physiologic hemoglobins, HbA and HbA2, also require a pair of a chains, and differ only in being coupled to two \u03b2 chains, and two \u03b4 chains, respectively. Typically, both HbA and HbA2 are synthesized at fairly stable concentrations, though HbA is produced in far greater abundance.\n\tGiven the tremendous import of these complexes, it should hardly be surprising that errors in their production can yield devastating results. What may be surprising, however, is that these errors\u2014including sickle-cell disease and thalassemia\u2014are among the most common of all inherited genetic disorders, with an estimated 7% of the world\u2019s population as carriers, two-thirds of whom reside in Africa.\n\tThalassemia describes a group of disorders in which either the \u03b1 or \u03b2 chain is quantitatively reduced. Depending on the mutation, these defects can present with a wide range of anemia-related symptoms, and are particularly prevalent throughout Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean. This geographical distribution is anything but random. Many studies have demonstrated that the production of suboptimal hemoglobin confers a degree of protection against malaria, a potentially deadly infectious disease caused by members of the Plasmodium genus, which parasitize red blood cells. It follows, then, that whereas in many regions throughout the world thalassemia may merely constitute disease, in those where malaria is endemic, it represents a favorable evolutionary advantage.\n\tOwing to a redundancy in the human genome, there are four copies of the \u03b1 globin gene, with two \u03b1-coding regions on each copy of chromosome.",
