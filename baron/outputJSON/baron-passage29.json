  "passage": "\tAh, but you see my friend, I fail to be \u201chipster\u201d without the checkered shirt, bow tie, and skinny jeans. My free-spirited best friend is only \u201cboho\u201d with her headband and fringe bag. And my \u201cpreppy\u201d sister is rarely seen without her bean boots and striped cardigans. One day, I will drive a Mercedes-Benz because, well why wouldn\u2019t I? And when all of my aspirations and the labels attached to them cause in me a great migraine, I will take Tylenol before stopping at the neighborhood Starbucks for my daily mocha latte. You see where this is going because you are so perceptive and undoubtedly a Millennial, known for your skepticism, feelings of self-importance, and immunity to the pathetic propaganda that so easily tricked the previous generations. But, are you immune to being tricked? You would do well to study the following list of definitions before continuing. They were all found via a simple Google search for the respective term.\n\t\u25a0 capitalism: an economic and political system in which a country\u2019s trade and\n\tindustry are controlled by private owners\n\tfor profit, rather than by the state \u25a0 consumerism: a social and economic\n\torder and ideology that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts\n\t\u25a0 propaganda: information, especially of\n\ta biased or misleading nature, used to\n\tinfluence an audience and further an agenda\n\t\u25a0 advertising: the marketing communication\n\tused by companies to persuade an\n\taudience to purchase their products\n\tand/or services mere exposure: a psychological phenomenon in which people develop a preference for things through familiarity\n\t\u25a0 affective conditioning: the transfer of\n\tfeelings from one set of items to another to encourage the public to associate a product with positivity\n\tCertainly, you have ascended beyond the manipulation accompanying such ridiculous subculture labels as those mentioned above. You have seen it and heard it all. Advertising is all around you; we live in a commercial world\u2014a capitalist economy with an unparalleled attachment to consumerism. But those sly little devils are far from bringing you to the dark side. Or so you think.\n\tNobody wants to feel easily influenced. Yet, I beg you to hear me out: advertising is everywhere because it works. U.S. companies spend an annual $70 billion in television ads, and this is before we take a look at other mediums of advertising like radios, magazines, website cookies, and even those terrible social media \u201csponsored\u201d ads. The truth is we don\u2019t like to feel manipulated, but we are. Advertising is by its nature a form of propaganda in that it changes perceptions with limited information\u2014it is neither objective nor complete.\n\tAdvertising is meant to do a few things. First, it informs the public of a product\u2019s existence (no harm in that, right?). Next, it is meant to build brand recognition\u2014as consumers, we want to trust and recognize the names behind our products. Third, advertising creates lifestyle identification. The product is somehow \u201clike you\u201d; it says something about you; you can relate to the product and its other consumers. The world of advertising spends a lot of money and time developing strategies to accomplish these three goals.\n\tWe will first look at logical persuasion, or the exposition of facts about products. This technique in itself is quite harmless. We cannot be informed consumers without information. Yet, I urge you to be skeptical of even the most straightforward advertising. Mere exposure is an effective tool in leaving lasting impressions on the public. With your only basis as recognition, you would be surprised to see how quickly you choose one product over another, even at a higher cost.\n\tPerhaps more dangerous is the strategy of nonrational influence, in which advertising schemes circumvent consumers\u2019 conscious awareness by depicting a fun or pleasant scene quite unrelated to the product itself. Here, affective conditioning allows you to associate positive feelings with specific products. For instance, a commercial might flash images of colorful flowers, sunshine, puppies, etc.; and even years later, your subconscious will recall these \u201cfeel good\u201d images when you spot that product. Psychology Today found that this type of advertising lowers brain activity and causes less restraint in the consumer. According to the study, you are 70-80% more likely to buy an inferior product when you have paired it with positive feelings. Just remember, my wary consumer, to use caution in a society of distortion and illusion. Advertising can be subtle, but powerful. And if you think you are unaffected, think again.\n\tFactors Influencing Consumer Behavior.",
