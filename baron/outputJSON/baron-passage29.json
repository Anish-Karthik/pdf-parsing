  "passage": "\tAlternative Energy\u2014two authors consider the state of alternative energy solutions \n\tPASSAGE 1 \n\tNo one is sure how much available oil is left, but considering our oil reserves took hundreds of millions of years to form, time to depletion is little more than a blink of an eye So we have two options\u2014stop relying on oil or use it up and watch the ensuing chaos \n\tOne promising alternative fuel source is ethanol. Our ancestors have been fermenting organic matter to make ethanol for thousands of years. Today ethanol is primarily consumed in alcoholic beverages, but why not also use it to power our cars? This alternative fuel is made by fermenting crops such as wheat, corn, and sugarcane One glucose molecule is broken down to form two ethanol molecules and two carbon dioxide molecules. Because it is made from organic matter, it is renewable\u2014a big pro compared to oil. Another benefit is that it\u2019s domestically made, so we don\u2019t have to rely on other countries for it. Unfortunately, it\u2019s slightly more expensive per mile than gasoline. Additionally, because its production uses crops, widespread implementation may cause an increase in some food prices \n\tAnother promising alternative is biodiesel Biodiesel is made out of animal fats, plant fats, and even used grease from restaurants. The glycerol backbone is removed from the fat, breaking the fat into three separate chains, which are then reacted with an alcohol to form the biodiesel. This type of chemical reaction is called a transesterification. Like ethanol, biodiesel is also renewable and domestically produced. It\u2019s also completely nontoxic and biodegradable. Unfortunately, like ethanol, it\u2019s also more expensive. While they may be more expensive, both of these fuel sources produce fewer greenhouse gases than regular gasoline. A couple extra dollars is a small price to pay for the environmental friendliness and self-sufficiency that these alternatives would provide \n\tOur current alternatives may not be perfect, but that\u2019s no reason to be discouraged The time for alternative fuel exploration is now. Why wait for oil to run out when superior sources of energy are already available and more are within reach? PASSAGE 2 There is a natural tendency to confuse change with progress. This is perfectly understandable, especially considering that we went from inventing electricity to perfecting aviation to reaching the moon all in a time period analogous to just a blink in the grand scheme of human history. Such prodigious leaps have left us hungry for more leaps, and there are benefits to restlessness, even if entropic; throw enough aimless darts in every direction and you\u2019ll find a bull\u2019s eye, even if by accident \n\tBut, such leaps have also left us skeptical against inaction, and now there is a proclivity to mistake the status quo for the stagnation of standing still. Call it the New Coke effect, where society takes three misguided steps back in its interminable urgency to keep moving forward \n\tThat said, I will be the first to admit that the future livelihood of an industrialized world most likely hinges on change, namely the discovery of an effective, inexpensive source of renewable energy. But, as the federal government wastes billions here and billions there throwing money at hopeless companies with hapless executives (Solyndra, for instance), I can\u2019t help but feel like renewable energy is New Coke. Certainly, we have not yet perfected our energetic ways and means, but why are we so obsessed with discarding what we have now? \n\tPrincipally, despite decades of apocalyptic forecasting of peak oil, petroleum output is as healthy as ever. In fact, petroleum companies are leaving the industry not because oil reserves are dwindling, but rather because oil production is so massive that demand is falling considerably. Case in point: oil is currently selling at a third the cost of bottled water \n\tSo, yes\u2014 the day most likely will come when the wells run dry. But, until then, let us celebrate our good fortune and be thankful for what we have",
