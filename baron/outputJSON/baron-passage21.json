Surface tension, one will recall, refers to the tendency of liquid molecules to coalesce with one another, thus minimizing their collective surface area. This phenomenon is the physical principle underlying a familiar adage, \u201coil and water do not mix.\u201d Phrased more precisely, oils, which contain primarily nonpolar hydrocarbon bonds, are immiscible with aqueous solutions, meaning they will not spontaneously dissolve in water, which consists of highly polar hydrogen-oxygen bonds. Instead, oils will tend to form a film over polar solvents, while surface tension serves to stabilize this film at the oil-water interface \n\tBecause they are amphiphilic\u2014meaning they possess both polar and nonpolar domains\u2014surfactants may interact with both components of this interface, and interfere with the electrochemical forces that maintain its integrity. Due to this unique property, surface tension lowering agents have found a host of applications in diverse commercial products, and are used in particular as emulsifiers, foaming agents, and detergents \n\tAn emulsion is merely a mixture of two normally immiscible liquids. The word emulsion derives from a Latin root meaning \u201cto milk,\u201d and, as an easily homogenized mixture of fats within an aqueous solution of sugars, proteins, and minerals, milk itself is a quintessential example of an emulsion. Moreover, without the surfactant activity of the complex lipids it contains, the fat globules dispersed throughout a given volume of milk would coalesce into a film on its surface. Similarly, the surfactants found in foaming agents decrease the tendency of soap bubbles to coalesce, and are responsible for the lathering effect found in many hygiene products such as toothpaste and shampoo \n\tSoap itself, interestingly enough, can also be considered a surfactant. Principally, soap is a salt consisting of a positively charged sodium ion and a negatively charged fatty acid. Importantly, the structure of an ionized fatty acid includes a nonpolar hydrocarbon \u201ctail,\u201d and a polar, carboxyl \u201chead.\u201d The polar head allows the fatty acid to partially dissolve in water, while the nonpolar tail facilitates its interaction with other nonpolar compounds, such as oils. Thus, by interrupting surface tension, soap allows oil to be washed away with water \n\tAt the risk of oversimplifying, soaps are created by exposing triglycerides gathered from either plant or animal sources to a strong base in a process called saponification The base hydrolyzes triglycerides to form glycerol and amphipathic free fatty acids The glycerol, in turn, is removed, and the fatty acids are complexed with sodium While the words soap and detergent are sometimes used interchangeably in common parlance, one should note that detergents are not synthesized by saponification \n\tStructurally, detergents differ from soaps only in the composition of their polar heads. That is, whereas soaps contain an ionized carboxyl group, detergents contain an ionized sulfonate. The significance of this alteration is twofold. First, detergent compounds are far less prone to precipitate and become ineffective in hard water. Hard water, of course, refers to water that is rich in dissolved calcium and magnesium as a result of exposure to limestone, and it is present in an estimated 80% of American households. Second, the sulfonate component of detergents makes their degradation products far more toxic to the environment than those of soaps. Owing both to their low cost of production and to their impressive utility, detergents are produced and sold on a scale that dwarfs all other commercially synthesized surfactants. Not surprisingly, this has become a cause of growing concern with regard to the potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems, as well as on human health, as exposure to detergent derivatives has been convincingly implicated in several endocrine and reproductive disorders \n\tThough this controversy is heated, complex, and unlikely to be settled in the foreseeable future, it has also sparked significant support for a fascinating field of biotechnology that deals with the surfactants produced endogenously by living organisms, and particularly those produced by microbes. With regard to their structure, these so-called \u201cbiosurfactants\u201d are highly distinct from both soaps and detergents, and yet several promising preliminary studies have shown them to be functionally viable alternatives to more conventional cleaning products. The advantage lies in the high biodegradability and biologically benign character of biosurfactants. The obstacle, of course, lies in the nightmarish logistics of isolating them on a large, industrial scale \n\tSurface Tension of Soap Bubbles The graph illustrates changes in surface tension over time in milliseconds (ms) for soap bubbles made with varying concentrations of surfactant. The time label on the x-axis is exponential and is compressed as the values increased",
