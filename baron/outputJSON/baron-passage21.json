  "passage": "\tSages and Fools The entirety of human interaction fits under just three umbrellas. In the first, both parties emerge from the rubble worse than before; the perpetrator of a murder gets life in prison and the victim\u2019s day is ruined, so to speak. In the second, everybody wins; I\u2019m terrible at cooking and you\u2019re abysmal at housework, so you make us pizza while I attack the fungus under your couch. And as for the third, well, a cynic will say that this is by far the largest umbrella\u2014if it were a pie chart, we\u2019re talking everything but the \u00e0 la mode. We call this interaction category the zerosum, because anything gained must come at the loss of another. Put another way, your tragedy is my windfall\n\tWelcome to the New Wall Street Poker players are fond of saying that if you look around the table and can\u2019t spot the fool, run away as fast as you can; you\u2019re it. The same goes for the world of finance, which has quickly become as adversarial as a duel at high noon. Such is the nature of equities, futures, bonds, and derivatives (to name a few): any transaction has both a winner and a loser. Either the buyer has purchased an instrument that is undervalued and will be worth more tomorrow, or the seller has unloaded a bloated instrument that will fall back closer to its \u201ctrue\u201d market valuation in the near future. Either way, dollars (both unrealized and actual) will flow from one pocket to another\n\tThus, within such a contentious system, it is to the advantage of all participants to trade with the fool. And, if the fool can\u2019t be readily found, trust that one will be enticed. Leading up to the Crash of 2008, fools were aplenty as wild speculation was the flavor du jour and sound financial theory was disregarded. Nowhere was this act of leapingbeforeyoulook as flagrant as in the mortgage industry, where loans were repeatedly and systematically extended to Americans with little to no chance of repaying the interest, let alone the initial capital. Known as \u201csubprime,\u201d high-risk borrowers with poor credit scores were extended money at interest rates far above par. The banks\u2019 deluded thought process behind this was that the interest rates were so high that, even if an inordinately large percentage of the borrowers defaulted, huge profits were still guaranteed. Besides, worse comes to worst, the bank still owns the house. It was a foolproof plan Until it wasn\u2019t. The housing bubble had finally burst. It wasn\u2019t just that a few people defaulted; rather, foreclosures were everywhere you looked. And, even worse, when the banks came by to collect the keys, the houses were now worth only fractions of what the banks lent for them. Consequently, they lost billions\n\tHere\u2019s the kicker: while the American financial system nearly collapsed, some had seen the fool coming from miles away, secretly cheering with each misstep by the savings and loan industry. So, while the guardians of the money boxes continued speculating on what they thought to be diamonds, a small handful on the fringes knew that it was nothing but coal. And they profited spectacularly\n\tThrough a convoluted, abstruse instrument known as a \u201ccredit default swap,\u201d these sages were able to make fortunes off of the mortgage implosions, laughing all the way to the bank (where nobody else most certainly was laughing). It was an adroit play by the sages, recognizing an obscure opportunity and capitalizing on the perfect storm. But, such were the just deserts of each party, and such is the black and white duality of the system. One is destined to lose his shirt, and another expands his wardrobe.",
