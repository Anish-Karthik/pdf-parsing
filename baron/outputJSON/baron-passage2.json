  "passage": "\tThe Downfall of Democracy? \u201cThe future of this republic is in the hands of the American voter.\u201d\n\t\u2014Dwight D. Eisenhower The statement above, made by the 34th President of the United States, paints a dismal picture when one considers the trends of the American youth. Those under the age of 35, in general, do not vote, do not participate in politics, and frankly, have no interest or trust in the government itself. The retreat of youngsters from the political realms can be seen in election turnouts surely, but it can also be noted in the miniscule numbers of young Americans who identify as either Democrats or Republicans. It is not only disinterest but also distaste that keep the next generation of representatives far from the poll booths and even further from office In fact, a recently published book Running From Office: Why Y oung Americans Are Turned Off to Politics found that only about ten percent of high school and university students would even consider running for public office, with disdain for federal positions at the highest\n\tIt might be easy to chalk up the younger generation as careless and unconcerned and altogether misdirected, but that\u2019s the easy way out, and it is flawed. Students are largely civic-minded; they volunteer, worry about public policies, and even congregate debate solutions to everything from environmental issues to human rights to healthcare Significant events like the war in Iraq or Barack Obama running for President or gay marriage rights may generate an influx in youth participation, but overall, young voters are disengaged from American democracy and looking at other ways of tackling society\u2019s problems. It is not that they are merely apathetic, but instead that they have lost faith in electoral politics and are highly suspicious of party labels\n\tIf it is distrust and suspicion that keep youngsters away, the U.S. must ask what has changed to trigger this worrying trend. One doesn\u2019t have to prepare extensive research methods to find that today\u2019s millennials view themselves as in an altogether worse situation than that of their parents or grandparents. Widespread opinion has them in a bitter, unrewarding job market bankrupted by the university and crushed underneath a stifling national debt. Their path is difficult and uncertain at best; behind these obstacles lies an inefficient and wasteful government that they are less than anticipatory to inherit The aforementioned book found that 25% of student-aged Americans showed absolute indifference to politics. More worrying were the 60% who held negative views of politics, avoided the subject at all costs, and thought of all politicians as devious and untrustworthy. More and more Americans are shunning away from the loaded labels of \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cliberal,\u201d instead finding themselves somewhere in the middle, socially liberal but fiscally conservative Alienated by the two-party system, young Americans would rather not be included in either disagreeable side\n\tDisinterested in a bleak future of more debt and less freedom, and wary of aligning themselves within partisanship, today\u2019s youth are doubtful of a government that promises few of the assurances it once pledged. Naturally, this trend is disquieting for a nation that depends on its voters and an interest in representation, both of which are in a state of deterioration. Yet, some may applaud the veer from partisanship\u2014 a phenomena that has left more undone than accomplished. Still, if democracy is to survive, something must be done to align the cynical millennials with a system that desperately needs their interference\n\tVoter Turnout in Presidential Elections by Age Source: 2012 U.S. Census Bureau: http://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p20-573.pdf",
