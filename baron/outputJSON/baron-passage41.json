What\u2019s more, it has done so with such routine periodicity that, in our modern age of annual inoculations, the enduring danger of this disease has grown all too easy to take for granted. Influenza owes its name to physicians of the Italian renaissance, who believed it was caused by inauspicious astrological \u201cinfluences.\u201d Today, of course, we know it to be the result of infection by one of several closely related strains of virus. However, unlike other viruses for which vaccines are available\u2014several of which, through tenacious public health efforts, have been eradicated worldwide\u2014influenza remains a perennial menace, and due to the unique nature of its genome, is unlikely to ever be completely conquered. Traditionally, outbreaks of influenza are classified as either \u201cepidemic,\u201d in which the incidence of the disease increases significantly within a given community, or \u201cpandemic,\u201d in which the incidence increases over a much larger region, such as a continent. While superficially the distinction may seem arbitrary, in fact it reflects two well-delineated facets of the influenza virus replication process. In the Northern hemisphere, \u201cflu season\u201d spans from November to April, and represents an annual recurrence of influenza epidemics among communities situated in this part of the world. Pandemic outbreaks, though not nearly as common, also seem to follow an approximate epidemiological pattern, typically occurring about three times per century. In the 20th century, these outbreaks included Spanish Flu in 1918, Asian Flu in 1957, and Hong Kong Flu in 1968. Of the three, Spanish Flu was by far the most devastating. With an estimated mortality as high as 100 million, its deadliness was on par with that of the infamous Black Plague, which ravaged Eurasia in the Middle Ages.\n\t\u201cAntigenic drift\u201d and \u201cantigenic shift\u201d are the two chief processes through which influenza circumvents our adaptive immunity, and are thought to be the causes of epidemic and pandemic influenza, respectively. To understand these two processes, it is necessary to have a working knowledge of the virus itself. There are three known species of influenza virus\u2014influenza A, B, and C\u2014each of which consists of eight segments of RNA contained within a protein capsid, which in turn is surrounded by a lipid envelope. Collectively, these RNA segments code for eleven proteins; two of which, upon synthesis, are expressed on the envelope\u2019s exterior. These two proteins are known as hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA). In terms of the viral life cycle, HA is responsible for attaching to sugar residues that coat the cells of our respiratory tracts. Once the virus has infected a cell and replicated within its nucleus, NA cleaves these residues, allowing the virus to spread further throughout the body. Because HA and NA are the outermost viral proteins, it is specifically against these two \u201cantigens\u201d that our white blood cells create antibodies. Furthermore, among the diverse strains of influenza, genetically encoded differences exist in the types of HA or NA expressed. This allows scientists to sub-classify strains based on the specific antibodies produced against them. For instance, the H1N1 strain was responsible for both Spanish Flu, as well as the Swine Flu pandemic of 2009, while H5N1 caused the Avian Flu epidemic of 2004.\n\tRandom point mutation to the genes encoding HA and NA is one way in which these subtypes evolve, and can, moreover, interfere with the efficacy of our antibodies. The aggregation of many point mutations over time is referred to as antigenic drift, and eventually results in renewed vulnerability to viral strains against which an individual was previously immune. Notably, influenza A lacks the ability to proofread and correct its genetic material during replication, and as a result, is prone to a much higher rate of mutation than other species of influenza. For this reason in particular, influenza A is responsible for the vast majority of annual epidemics.\n\tTo date, 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been identified, only a fraction of which are currently infectious to humans. However, because the influenza genome is split into segments, when an animal\u2014a bird, for instance\u2014is co-infected with a strain specific to its species, as well as one capable of infecting humans, the segments may become intermixed during replication in a process called \u201cviral reassortment.\u201d When the genes implicated in reassortment include either HA or NA, antigenic shift occurs, and the resulting viral particles will express novel proteins to which the entire human race is vulnerable. The table shows, for each human outbreak of influenza, relevant epidemiological data, and the viral subtype involved.\n\tHuman Influenza Outbreaks.",
