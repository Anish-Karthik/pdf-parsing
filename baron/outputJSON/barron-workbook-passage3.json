Like Leonardo, he studied anatomy, but, unlike Leonardo, instead of studying human anatomy, he studied the anatomy of the horse. He dissected carcass after carcass, peeling away the five separate layers of muscles, removing the organs, baring the veins and arteries and nerves. For 18 long months he recorded his observations, and when he was done he could paint horses muscle by muscle, as they had never been painted before. Pretty decent work, for someone selftaught.",
