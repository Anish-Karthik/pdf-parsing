  "passage": "\tTwo scientists present their views on vaccinations.\n\tPASSAGE 1\n\tSmoking tobacco causes cancer. It causes small cell and squamous cell cancers of the lung, as well as oral and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gastrointestinal carcinoma, and cancers of half a dozen additional tissues. It is highly correlated with the second leading cause of death in the United States, and the decision to not smoke reduces one\u2019s risk of lung cancer by more than half. This information will surprise no one. It is, therefore, baffling that 1 in 5 Americans continues to use tobacco. Yet there is one behavior on the rise that is still more contrary to human health than smoking\u2014and perhaps more inexplicable as well, as it cannot be explained away by chemical dependence, nor by social custom. I speak, of course, of the decision to not vaccinate one\u2019s children.\n\tThere is apparently a belief among these erring individuals that the ailments against which the Centers for Disease Control recommends we vaccinate are somehow less serious than we, as a society, have been led to believe. There is a belief, moreover, that because these diseases are easily preventable through modern medical science, they must, implicitly, be easily treatable as well. Let us clarify this matter.\n\tNot long before it was eradicated by vaccination, smallpox virus erased entire cultures on two continents, where fatality rates rose as high as 90%. For those who survived, it was a cause of permanent, often debilitating disfigurement. Prior to the HiB and DTaP vaccines, epiglottitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae, and diphtheria caused by Corynebacterium diptheriae were both exceedingly common causes of death in young children, largely because of their tendency to develop rapidly and obstruct the airway. Death typically occurs well before medical attention can be accessed, and thus, in spite of all our modern medical advances, these diseases remain just as dire as they were two hundred years earlier.\n\tWe could continue this list. In the past, for instance, rubella was the most common cause of congenital deafness, and mumps a major cause of sterility. Children who survived the measles, meanwhile, ran and still run the risk of the virus reemerging years later as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a frequently fatal infection of the brain. The point, however, is clear. V accination is neither a conspiracy, nor merely a matter of modern convenience; nor is it entirely without risk. But vaccination, plainly put, is the only effective medical intervention to safeguard our children from some of the deadliest and most virulent diseases known to man. PASSAGE 2\n\tLet us dispense entirely with the fallacies and the delusions; there is not an analytically credible source on the planet that will defend a link between vaccines and autism spectrum disorder. But for many conscientious parents who choose not to vaccinate their children, the decision is based not on delusion, but upon a simple, mathematical reality.\n\tPhilosophically, medicine is premised on a balance between beneficence, and nonmaleficence. That is to say, for a medical intervention to be deemed ethical and appropriate, the risks of not treating an individual must always outweigh the risks inherent in the treatment itself. Risk accompanies every medical intervention, and vaccination is no exception. Specifically, in a certain subset of individuals, exposure to either the gelatin or egg protein components used to stabilize vaccines can result in a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. Additionally, so-called \u201clive-attenuated vaccines\u201d, including those for varicella, rotavirus, and MMR, contain living strains of their corresponding pathogens that, through genetic modification, have been rendered pathologically inert. Rarely, these attenuated strains may undergo mutation, and revert back to their pathogenic forms. Immunocompromised individuals, such as those infected with HIV , are particularly at risk for this dangerous outcome.\n\tWhile it is true that adverse vaccine events are uncommon, it is equally true that, within the American population, most diseases against which vaccinations protect are uncommon\u2014more uncommon, in fact, than the incidence of adverse vaccine events. Thus, so long as the majority of the American population remains vaccinated, an unvaccinated individual will be well-protected through a phenomenon described as \u201cherd immunity.\u201d The decision not to vaccinate, therefore, hangs upon an appreciation of the dynamic balance between beneficence and nonmaleficence as it pertains to the individual. While some may argue that taking advantage of such a strategy violates an ethical obligation to society, one cannot help but wonder: when presented with the numbers, will these individuals truly value the health of society above that of their children? Their math, I would wager, just doesn\u2019t add up..",
