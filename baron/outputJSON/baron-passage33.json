  "passage": "\n\tAmory Blaine inherited from his mother every trait, except the stray inexpressible few, that made him worth while. His father, an ineffectual, inarticulate man with a taste for Byron and a habit of drowsing over the Encyclopedia Britannica, grew wealthy at thirty through the death of two elder brothers, successful Chicago brokers, and in the first flush of feeling that the world was his, went to Bar Harbor and met Beatrice O\u2019Hara. In consequence, Stephen Blaine handed down to posterity his height of just under six feet and his tendency to waver at crucial moments, these two abstractions appearing in his son Amory. For many years he hovered in the background of his family\u2019s life, an unassertive figure with a face half-obliterated by lifeless, silky hair, continually occupied in \u201ctaking care\u201d of his wife, continually harassed by the idea that he didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t understand her.\n\tBut Beatrice Blaine! There was a woman! Early pictures taken on her father\u2019s estate at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, or in Rome at the Sacred Heart Convent\u2014an educational extravagance that in her youth was only for the daughters of the exceptionally wealthy\u2014showed the exquisite delicacy of her features, the consummate art and simplicity of her clothes. A brilliant education she had\u2014her youth passed in renaissance glory, she was versed in the latest gossip of the Older Roman Families; known by name as a fabulously wealthy American girl to Cardinal Vitori and Queen Margherita and more subtle celebrities that one must have had some culture even to have heard of. She learned in England to prefer whiskey and soda to wine, and her small talk was broadened in two senses during a winter in Vienna. All in all Beatrice O\u2019Hara absorbed the sort of education that will be quite impossible ever again; a tutelage measured by the number of things and people one could be contemptuous of and charming about; a culture rich in all arts and traditions, barren of all ideas, in the last of those days when the great gardener clipped the inferior roses to produce one perfect bud. In her less important moments she returned to America, met Stephen Blaine and married him\u2014this almost entirely because she was a little bit weary, a little bit sad. Her only child was carried through a tiresome season and brought into the world on a spring day in ninety-six.\n\tWhen Amory was five he was already a delightful companion for her. He was an auburn-haired boy, with great, handsome eyes which he would grow up to in time, a facile imaginative mind and a taste for fancy dress. From his fourth to his tenth year he did the country with his mother in her father\u2019s private car, from Coronado, where his mother became so bored that she had a nervous breakdown in a fashionable hotel, down to Mexico City, where she took a mild, almost epidemic consumption. This trouble pleased her, and later she made use of it as an intrinsic part of her atmosphere\u2014especially after several astounding bracers.\n\tSo, while more or less fortunate little rich boys were defying governesses on the beach at Newport, or being spanked or tutored or read to from \u201cDo and Dare,\u201d or \u201cFrank on the Mississippi,\u201d Amory was biting acquiescent bell-boys in the Waldorf, outgrowing a natural repugnance to chamber music and symphonies, and deriving a highly specialized education from his mother.\n\t\u201cAmory.\u201d\n\t\u201cYes, Beatrice.\u201d (Such a quaint name for his mother; she encouraged it.)\n\t\u201cDear, don\u2019t think of getting out of bed yet. I\u2019ve always suspected that early rising in early life makes one nervous. Clothilde is having your breakfast brought up.\u201d\n\t\u201cAll right.\u201d\n\t\u201cI am feeling very old to-day, Amory,\u201d she would sigh, her face a rare cameo of pathos, her voice exquisitely modulated, her hands as facile as Bernhardt\u2019s. \u201cMy nerves are on edge\u2014on edge. We must leave this terrifying place to-morrow and go searching for sunshine.\u201d\n\tAmory\u2019s penetrating green eyes would look out through tangled hair at his mother. Even at this age he had no illusions about her.",
