Then, in World War II, SPAM luncheon meat becomes a  staple of soldiers\u2019 diets (often GIs ate SPAM two or three times a day). Next, SPAM\u2019s wartime omnipresence perhaps inspired the 1987 Monty Python skit in which a breakfast- seeking couple unsuccessfully tries to order a SPAM-free meal while a chorus of Vikings drowns them out, singing \u201cSpam, spam, spam, spam....\u201d To computer users drowning in junk e-mail, the analogy was obvious. \u201cSpam,\u201d they said, \u201cit\u2019s spam.\u201d",
