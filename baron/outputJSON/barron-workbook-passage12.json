  "passage": "\tThe following passage is taken from The Souls of Black Folk, W. E. B. Du Bois\u2019s classic study of the African-American\u2019s struggle in this country.\n\tOnce upon a time I taught school in the hills of Tennessee, where the broad dark vale of the Mississippi begins to roll and crumple to greet the Alleghanies. I was a Fisk student then, and all Fisk men thought that Tennessee was theirs alone, and in vacation time they sal- lied forth in lusty bands to meet the county school-commissioners. Young and happy, I too went, and I shall not soon forget that summer, seventeen years ago. First, there was a Teachers\u2019 Institute at the county-seat; and there distinguished guests of the superintendent taught the teachers frac- tions and spelling and other mysteries\u2014white 92 CRITICAL READING WORKBOOK FOR THE SAT / READING COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS\n\tteachers in the morning, Negroes at night. A picnic now and then, and a supper, and the rough world was softened by laughter and song. I remember how\u2014but I wander. There came a day when all the teachers left the Institute and began the hunt for schools. I learn from hearsay (for my mother was mortally afraid of firearms) that the hunt- ing of ducks and bears and men is wonderfully interesting, but I am sure that the man who has never hunted a country school has something to learn of the pleasures of the chase. I see now the white, hot roads lazily rise and fall and wind before me under the burning July sun; I feel the deep weariness of heart and limb as ten, eight, six miles stretch relentlessly ahead; I feel my heart sink heavily as I hear again and again, \u201cGot a teacher? Yes.\u201d So I walked on and on\u2014horses were too expen- sive\u2014until I had wandered beyond railways, beyond stage lines, to a land of \u201cvarmints\u201d and rattlesnakes, where the coming of a stranger was an event, and men lived and died in the shadow of one blue hill. Sprinkled over hill and dale lay cabins and farmhouses, shut out from the world by the forests and the rolling hills toward the east. There I found at last a little school. Josie told me of it; she was a thin, homely girl of twenty, with a dark-brown face and thick, hard hair. I had crossed the stream at Watertown, and rest- ed under the great willows; then I had gone to a little cabin where Josie was resting on her way to town. The gaunt farmer made me wel- come, and Josie, hearing my errand, told me anxiously that they wanted a school over the hill; that but once since the war had a teacher been there; that she herself longed to learn\u2014 and thus she ran on, talking fast and loud, with much earnestness and energy. Next morning I crossed the tall, round hill, plunged into the wood, and came out at Josie\u2019s home. The father was a quiet, simple soul, calmly ignorant, with no touch of vulgarity. The mother was different\u2014strong, bustling, and energetic, with a quick, restless tongue, and an ambition to live \u201clike folks.\u201d There was a crowd of children. Two growing girls; a shy midget of eight; John, tall, awkward, and eigh- teen; Jim, younger, quicker, and better-look- ing; and two babies of indefinite age. Then\n\tthere was Josie herself. She seemed to be the center of the family: always busy at service, or at home, or berry-picking; a little nervous and inclined to scold, like her mother, yet faithful, too, like her father. I saw much of this family afterwards, and grew to love them for their honest efforts to be decent and comfortable, and for their knowledge of their own igno- rance. There was with them no affectation. The mother would scold the father for being so \u201ceasy\u201d; Josie would roundly berate the boys for carelessness; and all knew that it was a hard thing to dig a living out of a rocky side- hill.",
