  "passage": "\tIn 1846, when the three Bronte sisters, hoping for publication, sent their verses to Messrs. Aylott and Jones, they adopted mascu- line pseudonyms, calling themselves Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Strictly speaking, this masculine disguise was unnecessary: in England, women writers had been published since the 1670s, when the novelist and play- wright Aphra Behn became the first woman to earn a living with her pen. The Brontes, how- ever, knew the prejudice they would face, were they to publish under their own names. Even Robert Southey, then Poet Laureate of England, shared this common prejudice, writ- ing to Charlotte Bronte, \u201cLiterature cannot be the business of a woman\u2019s life, and it ought not to be.\u201d",
