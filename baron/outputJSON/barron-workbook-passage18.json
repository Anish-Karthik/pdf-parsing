  "passage": "\tPassage 1\n\tThose who have long and carefully studied the Grand Canyon of the Colorado do not hesitate for a moment to pronounce it by far the most sublime of all earthly spectacles. If its sublimity consisted only in its dimensions, it could be sufficiently set forth in a single sentence. It is more than 200 miles long, from 5 to 12 miles wide, and from 5,000 to 6,000 feet deep. There are in the world valleys which are longer and a few which are deeper. There are valleys flanked by summits loftier than the palisades of the Kaibab. Still the Grand Canyon QS$$0 is the sublimest thing on earth. It is not QE$$0 so alone by virtue of its magnitudes, but by virtue of the whole\u2014its ensemble.\n\tThe common notion of a canyon is that of a deep, narrow gash in the earth, with nearly vertical walls, like a great and neatly cut trench. There are hundreds of chasms in the Plateau Country which answer very well to this notion. Many of them are sunk to frightful depths and are fifty to a hundred miles in length. Some are exceedingly narrow, as the canyons of the forks of the Virgen, where the overhanging walls shut out the sky. Some are intricately sculptured, and illuminated with brilliant colors; others are picturesque by reason of their bold and striking sculpture. A few of them are most solemn and impressive by reason of their profundity and the majesty of their walls. But, as a rule, the common canyons are neither grand nor even attractive.\n\tUpon first acquaintance they are curious and awaken interest as a new sensation, but they soon grow tiresome for want of diversity, and become at last mere bores. The impressions they produce are very transient, because of their great simplicity, and the limited range of ideas they present.\n\tIt is perhaps in some respects unfortunate that the stupendous pathway of the Colorado River through the Kaibabs was ever called a canyon, for the name identifies it with a baser conception. But the name presents as wide a range of signification as the word house. The log cabin of the rancher, the painted and vine-clad cottage of the mechanic, the home of the millionaire, the places where parliaments assemble, and the grandest temples of worship are all houses. Yet the contrast between St. Mark\u2019s and QS$$3 the rude dwelling of the frontiersman is not QE$$3 greater than that between the chasm of the Colorado and the trenches in the rocks which answer to the ordinary conception of a canyon. So is the chasm an expansion of the QS$$4 simple type of drainage channels peculiar to the QE$$4 QS$$4 Plateau Country. To the conception of its QE$$4 vast proportions must be added some notion of its intricate plan, the nobility of its architecture, its colossal buttes, its wealth of ornamentation, the splendor of its colors, and its wonderful atmosphere. All of these attributes combine with infinite complexity to produce a whole which at first bewilders and at length overpowers.\n\t Passage 2\n\tLast Saturday before dusk, the summer\u2019s 114 degree heat broke to 79 within an hour. A fury of wind whipped up, pelting houses with dust, debris, and gravel. Then a scatter of rain came, as a froth of purplish clouds charged across the skies. As the QS$$6 last of the sun\u2019s light dissipated, we could see Baboquivari QE$$6 Peak silhouetted on a red horizon, lightning dancing around its head.  The rains came that night\u2014they changed the world.  Crusty dry since April, the desert floor softened under the rain\u2019s dance. Near the rain-pocked surface, hundreds of thousands of bloodroot amaranth are popping off their seedcoats and diving toward light. Barren places will soon be shrouded in a veil of green.\n\tDesert arroyos are running again, muddy water swirling after a head of suds, dung, and detritus. Where sheetfloods pool, buried animals awake, or new broods hatch. At dawn, dark egg-shaped clouds of flying ants hover over ground, excited in the early morning light.\n\tIn newly filled waterholes, spadefoot toads suddenly congregate. The males bellow.\n\tThey seek out mates, then latch onto them with their special nuptial pads. The females\n\tspew out egg masses into the hot murky water.\n\tFor two nights, the toad ponds are wild with chanting while the Western spadefoot\u2019s burnt-peanut-like smell looms thick in the air.\n\tA yellow mud turtle crawls out of the drenched bottom of an old adobe borrow pit where he had been buried through the hot dry spell. He plods a hundred yards over to a floodwater reservoir and dives in. He has no memory of how many days it\u2019s been since his last swim, but the pull of the water\u2014that is somehow familiar.\n\tThis is the time when the Papago Indians of the Sonoran Desert celebrate the coming of the rainy season moons, the Jujkiabig Mamsad, and the beginning of a new year.\n\tFields lying fallow since the harvest of the winter crop are now ready for another planting.\n\tIf sown within a month after summer solstice, they can produce a crop quick enough for harvest by the Feast of San Francisco, October 4.\n\tWhen I went by the Madrugada home in Little Tucson on Monday, the family was eagerly talking about planting the flashflood field again. At the end of June, Julian wasn\u2019t even sure if he would plant this year\u2014no rain yet, too hot to prepare the field, and hardly any water left in their charco catchment basin.\n\tNow, a fortnight later, the pond is nearly filled up to the brim. Runoff has fed into it through four small washes. Sheetfloods have swept across the field surface. Julian imagines big yellow squash blossoms in his field, just another month or so away. It makes his mouth water.\n\tOnce I asked a Papago youngster what the desert smelled like to him. He answered with little hesitation:  \u201cThe desert smells like rain.\u201d His reply is a contradiction in the QS$$9 minds of QE$$9 most people. How could the desert smell like rain, when deserts are, by definition, places which lack substantial rainfall? The boy\u2019s response was a sort of Papago shorthand. Hearing Papago can be like tasting a delicious fruit, while sensing that the taste comes from a tree with roots too deep to fathom.\n\tThe question had triggered a scent\u2014creosote bushes after a storm\u2014their aromatic oils released by the rains. His nose remembered being out in the desert, overtaken: the desert smells like rain.",
