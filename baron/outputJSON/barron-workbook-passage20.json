  "passage": "\tMany primates live in an organized troop in which all ages and both sexes are included, and in which members always move compactly together as a stable social unit. There is a ranking hierarchy among troop males, although the strictness with which the hierarchy is enforced varies. The ranking relationship is recognized among them and the hierarchy functions to ameliorate conflict. The highest-ranking male or males defend, control, and lead the troop; the strong social bond among members and their safety is maintained. On the other hand, chimpanzees lack a stable social troop. Even members of a regional population, who are acquainted with each other, rarely move en masse but move in temporarily formed parties that usually consist of less than ten animals. Such parties maintain associative and friendly contact through their rich vocal and behavioral communication. Chimpanzee society ensures the free and independent movement of each individual based on highly developed individuality without the restriction of either territoriality or hierarchy. On the other hand, a chimpanzee enjoys the benefits of group life in that it can avoid the enemy and find fruits with less effort. Although there is a loose dominant and subordinate relationship among individuals, chimpanzees are rarely placed under the restraint of the ranking hierarchy. The rigidly organized troop characteristic of most primates must be an adaptation for avoiding enemies like man and carnivores and for defense against these enemies. In this context, a group of monkeys is more likely to survive than a single individual. The group provides a social mechanism for survival. Females and young monkeys, especially a female with a baby, must be protected by others. As their food, fruits, nuts, leaves, and some kinds of insects, is scattered in a wide area in the natural habitat, a dominant animal does not control the entire food source, nor does a subordinate animal starve when the former is satiated. An important problem in the rigid hierarchical social organization is that each animal must adjust its movements and behaviors to those of the troop. A rigidly organized troop cannot be maintained when individuals do not subordinate their personal desires for the good of troop unity or solidarity. The flexible social organization of the chimpanzee may be one resolution of this problem. This kind of social organization may be one of the original factors raising individuality to the level of personality. Chimpanzees have not rejected group life, but they have rejected individual uniformity and the pressure of a dominance hierarchy. That a number of experienced big males can serve as leader, appropriately coping with critical situations, and that followers can appropriately react to a leader\u2019s behavior, prove that chimpanzee society is not a simple chaotic gathering but a developed society based on highly developed psychological processes and individuality. The identity of fellow chimpanzees is formed in the mind of those chimpanzees who utilize the same range. The size of the regional population must be restricted by the upper limit of members that an animal can identify and have friendly relations with. Another factor restricting population size must be environmental conditions, that is, the volume and the distribution of food and shelter and the geophysical condition of the habitat. The latter may influence the moving pattern, moving range, and the grouping\n\tpattern of each individual and group of individuals. Chimpanzees form regional populations even in continuous habitats such as those found in the Budongo Forest.",
