  "passage": "\tWhat is money? That is not so simple a question as might appear. In fact, money can only be defined in terms of the functions it performs\u2014that is, by the need it fulfills. As Sir Ralph Hawtrey once noted, \u201cMoney is one of those concepts which, like a teaspoon or an umbrella, but unlike an earthquake or a butter cup, are definable primarily by the use or purpose which they serve.\u201d Money is anything, regardless of its physical or legal characteristics, that customarily and principally performs certain functions.\n\tThree such functions are usually specified, corresponding to the three basic needs served by money\u2014the need for a medium of exchange, the need for a unit of account, and the need for a store of value. Most familiar is the first, the function of a medium of exchange, whereby goods and services are paid for and contractual obligations discharged.\n\tIn performing this role the key attribute of money is general acceptability in the settlement of debt. The second function of money, that of a unit of account, is to provide a medium of information\u2014a common denominator or numeraire in which goods and services may be valued and debts expressed. In performing this role, money is said to be a \u201cstandard of value\u201d or \u201cmeasure of value\u201d in valuing goods and services and a \u201cstandard of deferred payment\u201d in expressing debts. The third function of money, that of a store of value, is to provide a means of holding wealth.\n\tThe development of money was one of the most important steps in the evolution of human society, comparable, in the words of one writer, \u201cwith the domestication of animals, the cultivation of the land, and the harnessing of power.\u201d Before money there was only barter, the archetypical economic transaction, which required an inverse double coincidence of wants in order for exchange to occur.\n\tThe two parties to any transaction each had to desire what the other was prepared to offer.\n\tThis was an obviously inefficient system of exchange, since large amounts of time had to be devoted to the necessary process of search and bargaining. Under even the most elemental circumstances, barter was unlikely to exhaust all opportunities for advantageous trade:\n\tBartering is costly in ways too numerous to discuss. Among others, bartering requires an expenditure of time and the use of specialized skills necessary for judging the commodities that are being exchanged. The more advanced the specialization in production and the more\n\tcomplex the economy, the costlier it will be to undertake all the transactions necessary to make any given good reach its ultimate user by using barter.\n\tThe introduction of generalized exchange intermediaries cut the Gordian knot of barter by decomposing the single transaction of barter into separate transactions of sale and purchase, thereby obviating the need for a double coincidence of wants. This served to facilitate multilateral exchange; the costs of transactions reduced, exchange ratios could be more efficiently equated with the demand and supply of goods and services. Consequently, specialization in production was promoted and the advantages of economic division of labor became attainable\u2014all because of the development of money.\n\tThe usefulness of money is inversely proportional to the number of currencies in circulation.\n\tThe greater the number of currencies, the less is any single money able to perform efficiently as a lubricant to improve resource allocation and reduce transactions costs.\n\tDiseconomies remain because of the need for multiple price quotations (diminishing the information savings derived from money\u2019s role as unit of account) and for frequent currency conversions (diminishing the stability and predictability of purchasing power derived from money\u2019s roles as medium of exchange and store of value). In all national societies, there has been a clear historical tendency to limit the number of currencies, and eventually to standardize the domestic money on just a single currency issued and managed by the national authorities. The result has been a minimization of total transaction costs within nation-states.\n\tBetween nation-states, however, costs of transactions remain relatively high, because the number of currencies remains high. Does this suggest that global efficiency would be maximized if the number of currencies in the world were minimized? Is this the optimal organizational principle for international monetary relations? Not necessarily. It is true that total transactions costs, other things being equal, could be minimized by standardizing on just a single global money. \u201cOn the basis of the criterion of maximizing the usefulness of money, we should have a single world currency.\u201d But there are other criteria of judgment as well; economic efficiency, as I have indicated, is a multi-variate concept. And we shall soon see that the costs of a single world currency or its equivalent, taking full account of both the microeconomic and macroeconomic dimensions of efficiency, could easily outweigh the single microeconomic benefit of lower transaction costs. As Charles Kindleberger has written: \u201cThe case for international money is the general case for money. [But] it may well be that the costs of an international money are so great that the world cannot afford it.\u201d",
