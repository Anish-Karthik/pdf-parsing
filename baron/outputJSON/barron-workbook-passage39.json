  "passage": "\tIn pre-Victorian times, despite the widespread belief that a woman\u2019s place was in the home, some strong-minded women found opportunities to participate actively in scientific work. In Before Victoria, Elizabeth Denlinger points out that, at that time, the  sciences were, to some extent, still in their infancy: they had not yet become official parts of the university curriculum, and therefore were open to women. Thus, Caroline Herschel, acting as assistant to her brother William, in the late eighteenth century performed basic astronomical research. The first woman to discover a comet, in later years Herschel catalogued every discovery she and her brother had made, creating research tools still in use today.",
