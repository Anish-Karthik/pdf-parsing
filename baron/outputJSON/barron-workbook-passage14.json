  "passage": "\tPassage 1\n\tLow wages, chronic unemployment and underemployment lead to low income, lack of property ownership, absence of savings, absence of food reserves in the home, and a chronic shortage of cash. These conditions reduce the possibility of effective participation in the larger economic system. And as a response to these conditions we find in the culture QS$$1 of poverty a high incidence of pawning personal QE$$1 goods, borrowing from local moneylenders at usurious rates of interest, spontaneous informal credit devices organized by neighbors, the use of secondhand clothing and furniture, and the pattern of frequent buying of small quantities of food many times a day as the need arises.\n\tPeople with a culture of poverty produce very little wealth and receive very little in return. They have a low level of literacy and education, usually do not belong to labor unions, are not members of political parties, generally do not participate in the national welfare agencies, and make very little use of banks, hospitals, department stores, museums or art galleries. They have a critical attitude toward some of the basic institutions of the dominant classes, hatred of the police, mistrust of government and those in high position, and a cynicism which extends even to the church. This QS$$2 gives the culture of poverty a high potential for protest and for being used in political movements aimed against the existing social order.\n\tPeople with a QE$$2 culture of poverty are aware of middle-class values, talk about them and even claim some of them as their own, but on the whole they QS$$3 do not live by them. Thus it is important to distinguish between what they say and what they do. For example, many will tell you that QE$$3 marriage by law, by the church, or by both is the ideal form of marriage, but few\n\twill marry. To men who have no steady jobs or other sources of income, who do not own property and have no wealth to pass on to their children, who are present-time oriented and who want to avoid the expense and legal difficulties involved in formal marriage and divorce, free unions or consensual marriages make a lot of sense. Women will often turn down offers of marriage because they feel it ties them down to men who are immature, punishing and generally unreliable. Women feel that consensual union gives them a better break; it gives them some of the freedom and flexibility that men have. By not giving the fathers of their children legal status as husbands, the women have a stronger claim on their children if they decide to leave their men.\n\tIt [consensual union] also gives women exclusive rights to a house or any other property they may own.\n\t Passage 2\n\tYou ask me what is poverty? Listen to me.\n\tHere I am, dirty, smelly, and with no \u201cproper\u201d underwear on and with the stench of my rotting teeth near you. I will tell you. Listen to me. Listen without pity. I cannot use your pity.\n\tListen with understanding. Put yourself in my dirty, worn-out ill-fitting shoes, and hear me.\n\tPoverty is getting up every morning from a dirt- and illness-stained mattress. The sheets have long since been used for diapers. Poverty is living in a smell that never leaves. This is a smell of urine, sour milk, and spoiling food sometimes joined with the strong smell of long-cooked onions. Onions are cheap. If you have smelled this smell, you did not know how it came. It is the smell of the outdoor privy. It is the smell of young children who cannot walk the long dark way in the night. It is the smell of the mattresses where years of \u201caccidents\u201d have happened. It is the smell of the milk which has gone sour because the refrigerator long has not worked, and it costs money to get it fixed. It is the smell of rotting garbage. I could bury it, but where is the shovel? Shovels cost money.\n\tPoverty is always being tired. I have always been tired. They told me at the hospital when the last baby came that I had chronic anemia caused from poor diet, a bad case of worms, and that I needed a corrective opera tion. I listened politely\u2014the poor are always polite. The poor QS$$8 always listen. They don\u2019t say that there QE$$8 is no money for iron pills, or better food, or worm medicine. The idea of an operation is frightening and costs so much that, if I had dared, I would have laughed....\n\tPoverty is looking into a black future.\n\tYour children won\u2019t play with my boys. They will turn to other boys who steal to get what they want. I can already see them behind the bars of their prison instead of QS$$5 behind the bars of my poverty. Or they will QE$$5 QS$$5 turn to the freedom of alcohol or drugs, and QE$$5 find themselves enslaved. And my daughter? At best, there is for her a life like mine.... Poverty is an acid that drips on pride until all pride is worn away.\n\tPoverty is a chisel that chips on honor until honor is worn away. Some of you say that you would do something in my situation, and maybe you would, for the first week or the first month, but for year after year after year? I have come out of my despair to tell you this. Remember I did not come from another place or another time. Others like me are all around you. Look at us with an angry heart, anger that will help you help me. Anger that will let you tell of me. The poor are always QS$$8 silent. Can you be silent too? QE$$8 QS$$8 QE$$8",
