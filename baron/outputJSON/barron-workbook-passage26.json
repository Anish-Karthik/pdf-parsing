  "passage": "\tPassage 1\n\tThe defects of This Side of Paradise should not blind the reader to its importance in Fitzgerald\u2019s career. It marked his movement, clumsy and pasted together as the novel often is, from a clever short-story writer and would-be poet to an ambitious novelist. All his life he was to think of himself primarily as a novelist, to save his best work for his novels, to plunder his published short stories for usable material for them. If he achieved nothing else in this first novel, he had at least taken his scattered literary effusions and his undescribed experiences, sifted them, shaped and reshaped them, often looked at them ironically, and fashioned them into a sustained narrative. Compared with the material he took directly from his Nassau Lit stories, the writing had improved greatly. In many rewritten passages, This Side of Paradise shows Fitzgerald moving to that freshness of language which became his identifying mark. The novel took the bold step that Fitzgerald needed: it confirmed his ideas about the importance of his feelings and about his ability to put them down. It helped Fitzgerald thrash out those \u201cideas still in riot\u201d that he attributes to Amory [the novel\u2019s main character] at the close of the book: his ideas about love and women, about the Church, about his past, about the importance of being as contrasted with doing. Though it borrowed heavily from the many writers to whom he was attracted, the book still has Fitzgerald\u2019s own stamp: the naivet\u00e9 and honesty that is part of \u201cthe stamp that goes into [each of] my books so that people can read it blind like Braille.\u201d If Amory is not as honest with himself as Fitzgerald\u2019s later characters can be, it is chiefly from a lack of perception rather than from a deliberate desire to deceive. Finally, though Fitzgerald placed his twin hopes of money and the girl in the book\u2019s great success, the book is not merely contrived to achieve these aims. The badness in it is not that of the professional who shrewdly calculates his effects; it is that of the ambitious amateur writer who produces what seems to him to be witty, fresh, and powerful prose. It is a much better book than The Romantic Egotist, the version he finished before he left Princeton. For Fitzgerald at twenty-three, it was the book he wanted to write, the book he could write, and the book 122 CRITICAL READING WORKBOOK FOR THE SAT / READING COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS\n\tthat did get written. Before it even reached its audience, Fitzgerald had found his craft. Passage 2\n\tIt has been said by a celebrated person that to meet F. Scott Fitzgerald is to think of a stupid old woman with whom someone has left a diamond; she is extremely proud of the diamond and shows it to everyone who comes by, and everyone is surprised that such an ignorant old woman should possess so valuable a jewel; for in nothing does she appear so inept as in the remarks she makes about the diamond. The person who invented this simile did not know Fitzgerald very well and can only have seen him, I think, in his more diffident or uninspired moods. The reader must not suppose that there is any literal truth in the image. Scott Fitzgerald is, in fact, no old woman, but a very good-looking young man, nor is he in the least stupid, but, on the contrary, exhilaratingly clever. Yet there is a symbolic truth in the description quoted above; it is true that Fitzgerald has been left with a jewel which he doesn\u2019t know quite what to do with. For he has been given imagination without intellectual control of it; he has been given the desire for beauty without an aesthetic ideal; and he has been given a gift for expression without very many ideas to express. Consider, for example, the novel\u2014This Side of Paradise\u2014with which he founded his reputation. It has almost every fault and deficiency that a novel can possibly have. It is not only highly imitative but it imitates an inferior model. Fitzgerald, when he wrote the book, was drunk with Compton Mackenzie, and it sounds like an American attempt to rewrite Sinister Street. Now, Mackenzie, in spite of his gift for picturesque and comic invention and the capacity for pretty writing that he says he learned from Keats, lacks both the intellectual force and the emotional imagination to give body and outline to the material which he secretes in such enormous abundance. With the seeds he took from Keats\u2019s garden, one of the best-arranged gardens in England, he enfloreated [generated flowers] so profusely that he blotted out the path of his own. Michael Fane, the hero of Sinister Street, was swamped in the forest of descriptions; he was smothered by creepers and columbines. From the time he\n\twent up to Oxford, his personality began to grow dimmer, and, when he last turned up (in Belgrade) he seemed quite to have lost his identity. As a consequence, Amory Blaine, the hero of This Side of Paradise, had a very poor chance of coherence: Fitzgerald did endow him, to be sure, with a certain emotional life which the phantom Michael Fane lacks; but he was quite as much a wavering quantity in a phantasmagoria of incident that had no dominating intention to endow it with unity and force. In short, one of the chief weaknesses of This Side of Paradise is that it is really not about anything: its intellectual and moral content amounts to little more than a gesture\u2014a gesture of indefinite revolt. The story itself, furthermore, is very immaturely imagined: it is always just verging on the ludicrous. And finally, This Side of Paradise is one of the most illiterate books of any merit ever published (a fault which the publisher\u2019s proofreader seems to have made no effort to remedy). Not only is it ornamented with bogus ideas and faked literary references, but it is full of literary words tossed about with the most reckless inaccuracy.",
