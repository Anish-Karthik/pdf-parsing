  "passage": "\tTraditionally, Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon was indeed supposed to have been influenced by African Negro sculpture but Picasso has since denied this, affirming that although he was much interested in Iberian1 sculpture he had no knowledge of Negro art while he was at work on Les Demoiselles. Only later in 1907, he states, did he discover Negro sculpture. Quite recently however Picasso has assured us that the two right-hand figures of Les Demoiselles were completed some time after the rest of the composition. It seems possible therefore that Picasso\u2019s memory is incomplete and that he may well have painted or repainted the astonishing heads of these figures after his discovery of African sculpture, just as only a year before, stimulated by Iberian sculpture, he had repainted the head of Gertrude Stein\u2019s portrait months after he had completed the rest of the picture.... The discovery and appreciation of African Negro sculpture among the artists of Paris in the early 1900\u2019s is still a somewhat confused story. It seems probable that as early as 1904 Vlaminck began to take an interest in this hitherto neglected art. Shortly afterwards he introduced Derain to his new enthusiasm, and before long Derain and his fellow fauve2 Matisse began to form collections. Vlaminck\u2019s admiration lay more in the romantic and exotic values of the masks and fetishes but Derain and Matisse found in them unhackneyed aesthetic values involving the bold distortion and structural reorganization of natural forms.\n\tIt is strange that Picasso, who had met Matisse by 1906, should have been unaware of Negro art until the middle of 1907 when, as he says, he discovered it for himself almost accidentally while leaving the galleries of historic sculpture in the Trocad\u00e9ro. However, the discovery, he affirms, was a \u201crevelation\u201d to him and he began immediately to make use of it. Whatever general stimulation the fauves had got from African art there is little specific trace of it in their painting. But several of Picasso\u2019s works of 1907-08 incorporate African forms and possibly colors to such an extent that the title \u201cNegro Period\u201d has hitherto been applied to his art of this time, including Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon. Actually, Iberian sculpture continued to interest him and often its forms were fused (and by critics confused) with those of the Congo and the Guinea Coast. For instance the Woman in Yellow has long been considered one of the important paintings of Picasso\u2019s Negro period but it now seems clear that this hieratically impressive figure is related to Iberian bronzes even more closely than are the three earlier figures of Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon which it resembles in style. As Sweeney has pointed out, the face and pose are remarkably similar to an archaic votive figure from Despe\u00f1aperros. The ocher color and striated patterns, however, may have been suggested by Negro art. More African in  form is the Head, which may have been inspired by the almond-shaped masks of the Ivory Coast or French Congo. 1 The term Iberian refers to the peninsula in southwest  Europe that is made up of Spain and Portugal. 2 The fauves were a group of twentieth-century French  artists noted for vivid colors and striking contrasts.",
