  "passage": "\tSearching the Skies In 1950, Enrico Fermi posited the question, \u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d when considering the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the likelihood of the existence of extraterrestrial life and mankind\u2019s lack of contact with, or evidence for, such civilizations. Later referred to as the Fermi Paradox, his provocative query was founded on the assumption that since the Sun is quite typical, other Earth-like planets surely exist and have intelligent life, and by now, should have visited or contacted Earth. Extraterrestrial intelligence, or ETI, refers to hypothetical intelligent civilizations that are assumed to exist based on the existence of human intelligence and the vast size of the universe. While popular and scientific opinion on ETI varies greatly\u2014from certainty to skepticism to downright incredulity\u2014the search for alien intelligence is extensive and substantive.\n\tWhether you anticipate the stringy worm guys with serious fire power in Men In Black; the eternally wise Jedi Master, Yoda; Stan Winston\u2019s nightmarish predators; or Steven Spielberg\u2019s sweet-loving E.T.; the search for intelligent life outside Earth is on. SETI, or \u201cthe search for extraterrestrial intelligence,\u201d is the collective name for activities undertaken to seek intelligent extraterrestrial life, and most recently involves constant monitoring of electromagnetic radiation with radio telescopes in hopes of detecting non-natural radio emissions or other signs of transmissions from civilizations on other worlds. In March 2014, UC Berkeley began an all-sky survey using the Arecibo radio telescope.\n\tAlthough we have been listening for messages since the 1960s, there have also been recent efforts to communicate with and purposely send out our own messages. Active SETI is the attempt to send messages to intelligent extraterrestrial life via radio signals. CETI, on the other hand, is any number of efforts to communicate with ETI that focuses on composing and deciphering messages that, theoretically, could be understood by another technological civilization. And the pursuit of ETI contact is no longer limited to the few and far between. SETILive, launched in February 2012, uses data from the Allen Telescope Array to allow the public to search radio signals themselves.\n\tMany astronomers and physicists attribute the renewed efforts to establish contact with alien civilizations to the present-day escalation in the discovery of exoplanets, or planets that orbit a star other than our Sun. According to NASA\u2019s data, as of June 2015, there have been 1,838 confirmed exoplanets, where, just 20 years ago, it seemed that our solar system was destined to be the extent of our planetary discovery. A significant part of that escalation can be attributed to NASA\u2019s Kepler Mission, an unmanned space observatory craft launched in 2009 to find Earth sized and smaller planets orbiting other stars. More than 800 systems like our own solar system with stars and orbiting planets have been identified.\n\tSo why is it, with a rejuvenated effort to find evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, that Fermi\u2019s question is still so pertinent? Despite billions of dollars and years of research, SETI has nothing substantial to show for itself. In fact, the closest thing to ETI contact is the Wow! Signal: a strong narrowband radio signal detected in 1977 by Jerry R. Ehman of Ohio State University\u2019s Big Ear radio telescope project. Ehman was able to successfully observe the signal for a 72-second window, circling its non-natural waves and writing \u201cWow!\u201d next to it\u2014his enthusiasm led to its name, but not to any significant breakthrough. Since 1977, efforts to relocate the signal have failed again and again.\n\tThe theoretical explanations for Fermi\u2019s paradox differ greatly. Some simply believe that few, if any, other civilizations exist. The Rare Earth Hypothesis suggests that Earth is unique, and so, therefore, is intelligent life. Others theorize that intelligent life has a tendency of destroying itself quickly; they hypothesize that self-annihilation occurs before contact can be made. On the other hand, many postulate that ETI\u2019s do exist, but we see no evidence for a variety of reasons. Perhaps we are too far apart in space or time. Perhaps humans, a relatively new species, haven\u2019t searched long enough. Or maybe we aren\u2019t listening properly. What if our distant neighbors are using different frequencies?\n\tRegardless of how certain or uncertain you are that extraterrestrial intelligent life exists, the venture to solve Fermi\u2019s Paradox is prevailing, and many believe the stakes are high. Some argue that the enormous expense involved in such projects is only surpassed by the futility of seeking aliens when we have had decades without success; but, others counter that the discovery of 1,838 exoplanets is hardly unsuccessful.\n\tNASA Space Program Budget.",
