Come get your face painted and try Zing\u2014 the new eight-hour energy shot! #zing #LawrenceCoFieldDay #lovemyjob Tom Willis has a position open for administrative secretary\u20142 years of experience preferred. Message with any inquiries Sherry Swanson needs help with the new software program. Alert: Technophobia! Can anybody explain?\n\tIf the eruption of smart phones has been the vanguard of anything, it is the near societal takeover of social media. Within the workplace, most supervisors quickly block sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram from company computers, and for good reason. Productivity is likely to decrease if three hours of an eight-hour workday are spent \u201cliking\u201d and \u201ctweeting\u201d and \u201cpinning.\u201d Then there is company bad-mouthing to consider. In the digital age, nothing one says or does or records online is private\u2014nothing. It takes only a few incidents to realize that a social media page is not the best place to post one\u2019s aggravation with company policies, to share confidential business plans, or to announce one\u2019s forthcoming resignation. And with even the most responsible staff, there is the heightened possibility of viruses or hacking Simply put, many employers decide the cons outweigh the pros\n\tMany of these same administrative boards agree that social media outside of work is just as harmful and make addendums to employee contracts outlawing all mention of work and/or colleagues via online social outlets. Other jobs go farther, demanding that one\u2019s social media personalities align with the corporate values maintained in the workplace. One may face disciplinary action and even termination if a page appears indecent or offensive. Still, when bringing in new hires, employers violate their own embargo and check out prospective employees\u2019 pages, quickly disqualifying applicants who may not seem to fit the company culture. Social media has certainly altered today\u2019s workforce, and many would argue that the change hasn\u2019t been for the best\n\tYet, the examples above paint another picture\u2014one where the workforce is actually improved by the open communication, wider network, free advertising, and increased accessibility of social media. In fact, there are many reasons why an employer should hesitate to ban all social networking. For some, the unique ability of social media to market company services and extend company reputation is indispensable. Many startup businesses find that they simply cannot compete without a social media page to deliver their mission and broaden their contacts. It can simply be the best tool available for advertising, marketing, expansion, and customer feedback. Likewise, it provides an unrivaled medium for market research\n\tNetworking expansion isn\u2019t the only plus While it is possible that social media could create discord, it is just as likely to promote collaboration and solidarity within company culture. Never before has it been as easy for colleagues to link up, interact, and initiate friendships. The benefits of having employees who know one another and develop respect for one another are endless. A congenial icebreaker, Facebook and Twitter pages are known for bringing together former strangers and allowing acquaintances to realize similar interests. A corporate culture that embraces affinity and breaks down barriers to allow open and constructive discussion is in a far better situation than one that doesn\u2019t\n\tSurprisingly, social media has also been connected to better company retention Some technologically savvy employers have created company pages where staff can make announcements, share ideas, discuss problems, and congratulate one another on excellent work. The page becomes a space where colleagues can support one another, but also where the company itself can show appreciation. Feelings of openness, teamwork, and apt recognition keep good workers happy and in their positions longer. More so, some offices report that employees who use social media are actually more productive, with occasional tweets and status updates providing a much-needed break in an otherwise monotonous workday\n\tSocial media in the workplace has gotten a bad rap; in many ways, it deserves it. But the role it can play\u2014when embraced appropriately\u2014 in networking, collaboration, and retention proves that it isn\u2019t as simple as that Like any new and rapidly changing technology, it will take time and adaptability for its advantages and pitfalls to be clear. The smart company will find it necessary to consider the implications social media presents for its future\u2014is it really something that can just be ignored or banned altogether?
