  "passage": "\tOne of the current definitions of a symbol is that it is \u201csomething that stands for something else.\u201d We can differentiate between three kinds of symbols: the conventional, the accidental, and the universal symbol.\n\tThe conventional symbol is the best known of the three, since we employ it in everyday language. QS$$2 If we see the word \u201ctable\u201d or hear the QS$$1 sound \u201ctable,\u201d the letters t-a-b-l-e stand for something else. QE$$1 They stand for the thing \u201ctable\u201d that we see, touch, and use. What is the connection between the word \u201ctable\u201d and the thing \u201ctable\u201d? Is there any inherent relationship between them? Obviously not. The thing table has nothing to do with the sound table, and the only reason the word symbolizes the thing is the convention of calling this particular thing by a name. We learn this connection as children by the repeated experience of hearing the word in reference to the thing until a lasting association is formed so that we don\u2019t have to think to find the right word.\n\tThere are some words, however, in which the association is not only conventional. When we say \u201cphooey,\u201d for instance, we make with our lips a movement of dispelling the air quickly. It is an expression of disgust in which our mouths participate. By this quick expulsion of air we imitate and thus express our intention to expel something, to get it out of our system. In this case, as in some others, the symbol has an inherent connection with the feeling it symbolizes. But even if we assume that originally many QE$$2 or even all words had their origins in some such inherent connection between symbol and the symbolized, most words no longer have this meaning for us when we learn a language.\n\t\tWords are not the only illustration for conventional symbols, although they are the most frequent and best known ones. Pictures also can be conventional symbols. A flag, for instance, may stand for a specific country, and yet there is no intrinsic connection between the specific colors and the country for which they stand. They have been accepted as denoting that particular country, and we translate the visual impression of the flag into the concept of that country, again on conventional grounds.  The opposite to the conventional symbol is the accidental symbol, although they have one thing in common: there is no intrinsic relationship between the symbol and that which it symbolizes. Let us assume that someone has had a saddening experience in a certain city; when he hears the name of that city, he will easily connect the name with a mood of sadness, just as he would connect it with a mood of joy had his experience been a happy one.\n\tQuite obviously, there is nothing in the nature of the city that is either sad or joyful. It is the individual experience connected with the city that makes it a symbol of a mood.  The same reaction could occur in connection with a house, a street, a certain dress, certain scenery, or anything once connected with a specific mood. We might find ourselves dreaming that we are in a certain city. We ask ourselves why we happened to think of that city in our sleep and may discover that we had fallen asleep in a mood similar to the one symbolized by the city. The picture in the dream represents this mood, the city \u201cstands for\u201d the mood once experienced in it. The connection between the symbol and the experience symbolized is entirely accidental.  The universal symbol is one in which there is an intrinsic relationship between the symbol and QS$$8 that which it represents. Take, for instance, the QS$$8 symbol QE$$8 of fire. We are fascinated by certain qualities of QE$$8 fire in a fireplace. First of all, by its aliveness. It changes continuously, it moves all the time, and yet there is constancy in it. It remains the same without being the same. It gives the impression of power, of energy, of grace and lightness. It is as if it were dancing, and had an inexhaustible source of energy. When we use fire as a symbol, we describe the inner experience characterized by the same elements which we notice in the sensory experience of fire\u2014the mood of energy, lightness, movement, grace, gaiety, sometimes one, sometimes another of these elements being predominant in the feeling.  The universal symbol is the only one in which the relationship between the symbol and that which is symbolized is not coincidental, but intrinsic. It is rooted in the experience of the affinity between an emotion or thought, on the one hand, and a sensory experience, on the other. It can be called universal because it is shared by all men, in contrast not only to the accidental symbol, which is by its very nature entirely personal, but also to the conventional symbol, which is restricted to a group of  people sharing the same convention. QS$$10 The  universal symbol is rooted in the QE$$10 properties  of our body, our senses, and our mind, which are common to all men and, therefore, not restricted to individuals or QS$$11 to specific groups.\n\tIndeed, the language of the universal symbol is the one common tongue developed by the human race, a language which it forgot before it succeeded in developing a universal conventional QE$$11 language.",
