  "passage": "\tA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea1 to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion of her marriage. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a QS$$1 privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely QE$$1 seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter\u2019s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they took place.\n\t\tElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavorable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot.\n\tShe had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no QS$$3 one, whose knowledge of a sister\u2019s frailty would QS$$3 have QE$$3 mortified her so much. Not, however, from any QE$$3 fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia\u2019s marriage been concluded on the most honorable terms, QS$$4 it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.\n\tFrom such a connection QE$$4 she could not wonder that he should shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.\n\tShe became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefitted by it.\n\tShe wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.\n\t1 A British coin.",
