  "passage": "\tIn 1970, Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and credited with saving over a billion people from starvation. In what is now called the Green Revolution, Borlaug led the research and development over a two-decade span beginning in the 1940\u2019s to dramatically increase agricultural production worldwide He introduced the synthetic farming methods already common in the United States and Britain to a global market, focusing particularly on the developing world, and succeeded in hiking food production and saving lives. Borlaug\u2019s initiative calls for celebration\n\tYet, it is these same agricultural techniques\u2014those associated with conventional farming\u2014that have gotten a bad rap over the last twenty-five years, causing the organic food market to soar to a whopping $63 billion by 2012. These laborsaving, high-yielding techniques began in the late 18th century and were perfected for nearly two centuries before worry spread that they seriously harmed the soil and allowed toxic chemicals to enter the food supply. In the 1940\u2019s, while Borlaug was busy feeding the world\u2019s impoverished, Albert and Gabrielle Howard\u2014both accomplished botanists\u2014 were developing organic agriculture. Organic farming is the process by which crops are raised using only natural methods to maintain soil fertility and control pests\n\tIn the current food market, GMO\u2019s, or genetically modified organisms, turn noses faster than saturated fats and soda pop. Instead, organic farmers rely on crop rotation, green manure, and biological pest control, while excluding synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and growth hormones. Organic agriculture is said to promote sustainability, openness, health, and safety, and its standards are closely regulated by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements. The IFOAM bases the foundation of organic farming on the minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, preserve, and improve ecological harmony. While this strategy sounds more \u201cconventional\u201d and effortless than what is now coined conventional farming, organic agriculture is actually quite scientific\n\tEcologically, organic farming is designed to promote and enhance biodiversity, so it must combine scientific knowledge and technologies to stimulate naturally occurring biological processes. For instance, organic farming uses pyrethrin, a natural pesticide found in the chrysanthemum flower, to deter pests, and potassium bicarbonate to control disease and suppress unruly weeds. Furthermore, where conventional farming focuses on mass production of each individual crop, organic farming encourages polyculture, or multiple crops being raised in the same space. To replace nutrients, organic farming relies on the natural breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms like mycorrhiza, which forms a symbiotic relationship between fungi and plant roots. To replenish nitrogen, green manure is created by leaving uprooted crop parts to wither on a field, and is then used as a cover crop to fix nitrogen into the soil\n\tThe science doesn\u2019t stop with the crops. On farms with livestock, the field of agroecology\u2014 which includes organic agriculture\u2014attempts to provide animals with natural living conditions and feed. Just like in plants, organic farming rejects any growth hormones or genetic engineering in animals. The USDA has specific regulations in regard to organic livestock, demanding that the animals receive only organic feed and are pastured rather than caged Despite the popularity of organic foods, many argue that the concerns over conventional farming are a luxury of the rich. Organic farming yields far less than conventional methods, uses more land and more labor, and is, therefore, more expensive. When prices rise and production falls, it is the poor that suffer. With the United Nations reporting 870 million people worldwide suffering from chronic malnutrition, organic farming faces a tough argument against the capital-intensive, prolific conventional means. Science has a lot more work to do before organic agricultural methods can feed the world\n\tAverage Cash Crop Prices.",
