  "passage": "\n\tPASSAGE 1\n\tThe electoral college has received much attention lately, primarily for being antiquated and absurd. However, I would argue that it\u2019s actually much more absurd than most realize. History class provides us with a rather fragmented understanding of the electoral college.\n\tWe teach in schools that a presidential candidate must receive an absolute majority of the electoral college votes to win the presidential election, but we don\u2019t teach the mechanics of how a candidate actually receives these votes. A party\u2019s electors are chosen in a variety of ways, but they\u2019re typically reputable members of the party. When a citizen casts a vote during the presidential election, he or she is actually voting for a particular party\u2019s electors to cast their votes for the presidential candidate to whom they have pledged.\n\tWhat we certainly don\u2019t teach in schools is that these electors in many states aren\u2019t even legally obligated to actually choose the candidate with whom they\u2019re allied! As of 2000, there were 24 states without laws preventing this, for a total of a possible 257 rogue votes. In fact, there have been a minimum of 157 cases of such \u201cfaithless voting.\u201d Until 2008, Minnesota\u2019s electors voted anonymously, thus the number of faithless votes is almost certainly higher. Even in the states where there are penalties for faithless voting, the penalties tend to be minimal and aren\u2019t typically enforced. Thus, the only things keeping electors honest are the honor code and the desire to stay reputable members of their parties.\n\tAside from faithless voting, there have also been cases where the electors died in between being chosen as electors and casting their votes. Obviously, this isn\u2019t a frequent occurrence, but still a problem that we wouldn\u2019t have to contend with in a popular vote system.\n\tIt\u2019s hard to understand why we maintain a system with so many glaring problems and very few redeeming qualities. Many cite tradition and the insight of our forefathers as reasons for preserving the electoral college, but the electoral college isn\u2019t even intact in its original form, since the second place candidate no longer serves as vice president. It\u2019s way past time we cut our losses and admit that we\u2019ve been defending a ridiculous arrangement for decades. If we weren\u2019t ashamed of it, maybe we\u2019d actually be teaching its intricacies in school. PASSAGE 2\n\tThe iron fabric of Classic American Essence had a good run. It weathered its way through the centuries, bending with the ebb of turmoil and stretching with the flow of time that brought us to this point. But, the infrastructure was never meant to be a permanent solution; it was a stopgap, a framework to be patched up and torn down and remodeled as the country and its people grew. Somewhere along the line, though, we turned our attention to other matters, and we forgot that basic premise of oxidation: even iron, you see, corrodes.\n\tWashington, Franklin, Jefferson, Adams: great men, one and all. Yet, only men\u2014 flawed and misinformed, limited by the pervasive misconceptions of the era and hamstrung by the absence of electricity, Internet, Red Bull, and fish oil. Nonetheless, with each monument built and mountain face carved, with each coin minted and dollar bill printed, we came to see them less as mortals than demigods, until we came to the point of no return when our forefathers became Our Forefathers. Now, seemingly every political debate hinges on the infallibility of these framers, and progress is often thwarted by the unimaginative but omnipotent four-word objection\u2014\u201cbut the Constitution says....\u201d as if anything written by quill and vellum inside lead-painted walls could ever be indisputable in its absolute certainty.\n\tMore than 200 years of complacency have left us with something resembling less a federal government than a yard sale of antiquated institutions, with none more dusty than the electoral college. Consider that it\u2019s theoretically possible to receive just 11 votes, have your opponent receive 200 million, and still win the election under the electoral college.\n\tSuch is the nature of the \u201cwinner take all\u201d system in which winning the 11 most populous states by as little as one vote is enough to overcome landslide defeats in the other 39 states and the District of Columbia.\n\tWhatever its initial purpose may have been, perhaps it\u2019s time to eschew the esoteric in favor of simple arithmetic. Let us turn our attention to progress, lest our fervent insistence on tradition leave us obsolete.\n\t1912 U.S. Presidential Election Results",
