  "passage": "\tYou\u2019re driving and suddenly, out of nowhere, you end up in a very bad part of town It looks very different from the neighborhoods you have just passed\u2014the streets are rough and pot-holed, the windows are boarded up, most stores are closed down and the ones that aren\u2019t are covered in spray paint. You might turn the car around or lock your doors nervously or ask your iPhone to reroute. And your unease isn\u2019t unwarranted: these areas have the highest crime rates, the highest unemployment rates, the lowest graduation rates, the lowest median incomes, etc. But how did it get this way?\n\tThe answer may lie in residential segregation, or the sorting of population groups into areas to shape living environments. Residential segregation occurs on racial, ethnic, and income scales; but historically, African Americans are the most residentially segregated. The idea is to isolate neighborhood contexts to make certain areas more appealing to specific population groups. And while it may not be obvious how grouping \u201clike\u201d populations can create slums, it is proven to produce negative socioeconomic outcomes for minority groups Let us first consider the example of Baltimore, where a century of public policies segregated metropolitan landscapes and turned \u201cblack neighborhoods\u201d into overcrowded slums. In 1910, residential segregation ordinances restricted African Americans to certain blocks and created federal housing subsidies that directed low income black families away from middle class suburbs. Additionally, favorable subsidies were denied to subdivisions that refused to exclude African Americans entirely. Real estate agencies began directing prospective buyers and/or renters to restrictive areas and banks began redlining, or failing to insure mortgages in black neighborhoods\n\tThe result of these policies is clear. The federal government prohibited black families from accumulating housing equity and coerced blacks into homes with higher interest rates, while local jurisdictions forced public housing into designated areas and created overcrowded, under-resourced neighborhoods. The schools saw education deteriorate as teachers were overwhelmed with remediation and discipline, and unable to spend the necessary time on grade-level curriculum. Exclusionary zoning and discriminatory policies created communities of poverty with whites fleeing the area, businesses closing down, and future investments collapsing. Without employment opportunities, the poor became poorer, anxious, and more isolated\n\tIn Chicago, a similar pattern occurred. Gentrification, or renovation to improve property values, forced the poor out of certain areas and steered them toward others Homeowners were restricted from selling to blacks and when black families did purchase homes, it was at an average of one-third higher interest rate. The housing starved African Americans were pushed into segregated neighborhoods via urban renewal plans, and municipal resources were reserved for white neighborhoods. Unemployment rates soared, public school systems had more students than their budgets allowed, understaffed police departments responded to violence with violence, and impoverished blacks turned to criminal activity to make money and gain protection\n\tSt. Louis County has a history of state-sponsored segregation that is directly responsible for police-community hostility in its surrounding areas. Zoning rules have continuously classified white neighborhoods as \u201cresidential\u201d and black neighborhoods as \u201ccommercial\u201d or \u201cindustrial,\u201d leaving the latter starving for resources and ample law enforcement. Discrimination practices still allow landlords to refuse to accept tenants with subsidized rents, while relocation assistance programs offer incentives to families that comply with the city\u2019s population shifts. In essence, federal regulations enforce the continuance of \u201cghettos\u201d or slums that are undoubtedly connected to distrust and violent protests\n\tWhether caused by exclusionary zoning, public housing enforcement, gentrification, white flight, or a combination of all these factors and more, a history of residential segregation has purposely imposed areas of poverty, unemployment, and lack of necessary resources like healthcare, education, and security. The effects speak for themselves every time you accidentally drive into the slums. Moreover, once those policies turn neighborhoods into overcrowded slums, populations begin to associate the African Americans who live there with slum characteristics, erroneously mistaking the causes for the effects. Is it any wonder that the inhabitants find themselves angry, desperate, and distrustful?",
