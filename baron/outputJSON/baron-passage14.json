  "passage": "\n\tPASSAGE 1\n\t\u201cWell, children, where there is so much racket there must be something out of kilter. I think that \u2018twixt the negroes of the South and the women of the North, all talking about rights, the white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But what\u2019s all this here talking about?\n\tThat man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud-puddles, or gives me any best place! And ain\u2019t I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! I could have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain\u2019t I a woman? I could work as much and eat as much as a man\u2014when I could get it\u2014and bear the lash as well! And ain\u2019t I a woman? I have borne thirteen children, and seen them most all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother\u2019s grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain\u2019t I a woman?\n\tThen they talk about this thing in the head; what\u2019s this they call it? [Intellect, somebody whispers] That\u2019s it, honey. What\u2019s that got to do with women\u2019s rights or negroes\u2019 rights? If my cup won\u2019t hold but a pint, and yours holds a quart, wouldn\u2019t you be mean not to let me have my little half measure-full?\n\tThen that little man in black there, he says women can\u2019t have as much rights as men, \u2018cause Christ wasn\u2019t a woman! Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him.\n\tIf the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone, these women together ought to be able to turn it back, and get it right side up again!\n\tAnd now they is asking to do it, the men better let them.\n\tObliged to you for hearing me, and now old Sojourner ain\u2019t got nothing more to say.\u201d PASSAGE 2\n\tDo you realize that in no other country in the world with democratic tendencies is suffrage so completely denied as in a considerable number of our own states? There are thirteen black states where no suffrage for women exists, and fourteen others where suffrage for women is more limited than in many foreign countries.\n\tDo you realize that when you ask women to take their cause to state referendum you compel them to do this: that you drive women of education, refinement, achievement, to beg men who cannot read for their political freedom?\n\tDo you realize that such anomalies as a college president asking her janitor to give her a vote are overstraining the patience and driving women to desperation?\n\tDo you realize that women in increasing numbers indignantly resent the long delay in their enfranchisement?\n\tYour party platforms have pledged women suffrage. Then why not be honest, frank friends of our cause, adopt it in reality as your own, make it a party program, and \u201cfight with us\u201d? As a party measure\u2014a measure of all parties\u2014why not put the amendment through Congress and the legislatures? We shall all be better friends, we shall have a happier nation, we women will be free to support loyally the party of our choice, and we shall be far prouder of our history.\n\t\u201cThere is one thing mightier than kings and armies\u201d\u2014aye, than Congresses and political parties\u2014\u201cthe power of an idea when its time has come to move.\u201d The time for woman suffrage has come. The woman\u2019s hour has struck. If parties prefer to postpone action longer and thus do battle with this idea, they challenge the inevitable. The idea will not perish; the party which opposes it may. Every delay, every trick, every political dishonesty from now on will antagonize the women of the land more and more, and when the party or parties which have so delayed woman suffrage finally let it come, their sincerity will be doubted and their appeal to the new voters will be met with suspicion. This is the psychology of the situation. Can you afford the risk? Think it over.",
