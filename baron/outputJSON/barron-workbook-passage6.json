  "passage": "\tPassage 1\n\tThere are several kinds of stories, but only one difficult kind\u2014the humorous. The humorous story is American; the comic story, English; the witty story, French. The humorous story depends for its effect upon the manner of the telling; the comic story and the witty story upon the matter. The humorous story may be spun out to great length, and may wander around as much as it pleases, and arrive nowhere in particular; but the comic and witty stories must be brief and end with a point. The humorous story bubbles gently along; the others burst.\n\t Passage 2\n\tAmerican humor, neither transfiguringly lucid and appropriate like the French, nor sharp and sensible like the Scotch, is simply the humor of imagination. It consists in piling towers on towers and mountains on mountains; of heaping a joke up to the stars and extending it to the end of the world. With this distinctively American humor Bret Harte had little or nothing in common. The wild, sky-breaking humor of America has its fine qualities, but it must in the nature of things be deficient in two qualities, not only supremely important to life and letters, but also supremely important to humor\u2014reverence and sympathy. And these two qualities were knit into the closest texture of Bret Harte\u2019s humor.",
