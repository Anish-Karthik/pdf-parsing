  "passage": "\tIf he wasn\u2019t a myth maker himself, at least Clement Clarke Moore was a great myth refiner. He started with St. Nicholas, giver of presents, whom the Dutch settlers had brought over to New York. Moore\u2019s portrait of the good saint is as fleshy and real as some Frans Hals painting of a burgher: The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.\n\tBut with American efficiency, Moore combines the figure of St. Nicholas with that of Kris Kringle, who (in Norwegian lore) helped the saint by driving a reindeer-drawn sleigh. Moore fires Kris, leaving St. Nick to do his own driving. The result is our own American Santa Claus. Moore removes St.\n\tNick\u2019s bishop\u2019s miter, decks him out in fur, gives him a ruddy face and a pot belly, hands him a sack of toys and calls him an elf\u2014suggesting a pointed cap. Thomas Nast, our most authoritative Santa Claus delineator, stuck closely to QS$$3 Moore\u2019s description, and ever since, few artists have dared depart from it.\n\tTo see how good Moore\u2019s imagination is, you have only to compare his version of St.\n\tNicholas with Washington Irving\u2019s QS$$4 of QE$$3 a few years earlier. In 1809, in \u201cKnickerbocker\u2019s History of New York,\u201d Irving makes St. Nick a friendly Dutch-American deity \u201criding jollily among the tree-tops\u201d in (of all things) a wagon, not only on Christmas but also on any old holiday afternoon. What pulled that silly wagon Irving doesn\u2019t say, or why it didn\u2019t snag itself on a branch and bust both axles.\n\t\tBut Moore in his genius provides St. Nick with reindeer power. And by laying marvelous names on those obedient steeds, he makes each one an individual. Though ruminants may be poorly designed for flight, Moore doesn\u2019t worry his head about aerodynamics; he just sidesteps the whole problem. Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, and the rest of the crew simply whiz up to the rooftop by pure magic. It never occurs to us to QS$$5 question such a feat. We are one with Moore\u2019s protagonist, a man with \u201cwondering eyes.\u201d Delving into John Hollander\u2019s recent Library QE$$4 QE$$5 of America anthology \u201cAmerican Poetry: The Nineteenth Century,\u201d I was glad to find \u201cA Visit From St. Nicholas\u201d right there along with works by Whitman, Emily Dickinson and Jones Very. Professional QS$$6 deconstructionists may sneer, but popular demand has fixed the poem securely in our national heritage. If Mr. Hollander had left it out, it would have been missed. Statistics are QE$$6 scarce, but it seems likely that Moore\u2019s masterwork has been reprinted, recited and learned by heart more often than any other American poem\u2014and that goes for \u201cThe QS$$7 Raven,\u201d \u201cCasey at the Bat,\u201d and Sylvia Plath\u2019s QE$$7 \u201cDaddy.\u201d To be sure, mere popularity QS$$8 doesn\u2019t make a work of art great. If QE$$8 it did, then \u201cSeptember Morn,\u201d that delicate tribute to skinny-dipping once reproduced on calendars hung in barbershops and pool halls galore, would be a better  painting than \u201cNude Descending a Staircase\u201d any day. And yet a poem like Moore\u2019s that has stuck around for 171 years has to have something going for it.\n\tWell then, what? I submit that the poem\u2019s immortality may be due not only to Moore\u2019s perfecting a great myth, but also to his skill in music-making. It is a moribund QS$$9 reader who doesn\u2019t feel the spell of its QE$$9 bounding anapests, as hard to ignore as a herd of reindeer on your roof. Poets today tend to shy away from such obvious rhythms. They shrink too from alliteration, which, applied badly, seems bric-a-brac.\n\tBut Moore lays it on thick, and makes it work like a charm: the \u201cfl\u201d sounds in \u201cAway to the window I flew like a flash,\u201d the hard \u201cc\u201d sounds in \u201cMore rapid than eagles his coursers they came.\u201d As for his rhymes, most clunk along unsurprisingly (like \u201chouse\u201d and \u201cmouse\u201d), but a few sound Muse-inspired. If any later versifier ever hits upon another pair of rhyming words as fresh and precise as these, let him die smug: He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of  a thistle.\n\tHistory doesn\u2019t tell us whether Moore\u2019s daughters, who first received the poem as a Christmas present in 1822, were disappointed at not getting dolls instead. Anyhow, it is a safe bet that, a hundred years from now, many a more serious and respectable poem will have departed from human memory like the down of a thistle, while Moore\u2019s vision of that wonderful eight-deer sleigh will go thundering on.\n\t\u201cA Visit From St. Nicholas\u201d may be only a sweet confection, yet how well it lasts. On a cold winter night, it can warm you to the quick: a homemade verbal cookie dipped in Ovaltine.",
