  "passage": "\tStrangely enough, among the high points of the Jewish Museum\u2019s exhibition entitled Wild Things: The Art of Maurice Sendak, is a small alcove off the main gallery. Decked out with soft pillows, a shaggy rug, and a generous QS$$0 assortment of Sendak books, this retreat QE$$0 from the museum\u2019s crowds was inspired by Max\u2019s imaginary bedroom in Where the Wild Things Are, perhaps Sendak\u2019s most famous children\u2019s tale. Walking through the exhibit\u2019s thematically arranged rooms, exploring the artist\u2019s Eastern European roots, his connections to Brooklyn\u2019s Jewish community, and his links to Germany, land of the Holocaust and of the brothers Grimm, I was increasingly drawn to this simple room where a weary mother could read to her sleepy child.",
