His work developing the first polio vaccine was the opening shot in a war that has led to the disease\u2019s virtual eradication. (In 2001, polio, which once paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children annually, claimed only 600 new victims worldwide.) Though Salk\u2019s vaccine has been superseded by Albert Sabin\u2019s cheaper oral vaccine, Salk\u2019s legacy and name live on.",
