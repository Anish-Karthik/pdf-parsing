  "passage": "\tFinnegan\u2014A short story David Benson was a timid boy born to parents who had long since stopped worrying about having children. Willie and Louise had three grown girls, the youngest was nineteen and leaving to cosmetology school the year David was born. Louise had suspected an arsenal of health issues before realizing she was with child, and even then, she waited another three weeks to tell her unsuspecting husband\n\tLong ago, when he had just taken over the farm and his body was strong and his dreams were considerable, Willie had wanted a son more than anything else. He had hopes of expanding his property, becoming a rich man, and gaining respect in town\u2014these were all things that never came which he planned to pass on to the son who came far too late. By the time David was born, more than half the farm had been divided and sold, and Willie kept only a handful of hired hands to tend his small share of the land while he drove semi-trucks fifty hours a week to supplement his meager income David was an oversensitive, misunderstood boy. He learned quickly that his mother was far too tired to love him as she had the girls. His father, often absent, seemed distant and begrudging around David. So it was that David, from the age of four on, often wandered the farm alone, contemplating the burly pigs or collecting berries and nuts or simply doing his best to avoid the sinister silence that was home When David was ten, he felt that he would have his first adventure. Mr. Harding, an old friend of his father who had a boy just two years older than David, offered to let David stay with them in town. It\u2019d be easier on Louise if she didn\u2019t have to drive the boy to and from school, and David would be happier having Michael to keep him company. David could spend weekends on the farm and help Willie with the chores, of course For the first time in his life, David felt that whatever he was missing he was sure to find; whatever was the void that lingered about the farm it was sure to disappear in town\n\tBut whatever it was that David was looking for, he didn\u2019t find it with the Hardings. Mr Harding was a boisterous banker who found David\u2019s shyness unbearable. Mrs. Harding was a rather large woman who spent nine tenths of her day cooking and grew solemn when David refused second helpings. And in Michael, David found only a combative stranger who held a singular interest: riding his bicycle around the town square in search of the coveted Sara Ridenour David had just turned fourteen when walking back from school, he heard the pathetic whimper. The puppy was small\u2014obviously malnourished and feeble\u2014and much too young to be away from its mother. David removed his jacket and coddled the pup against his chest as he walked briskly back to the Hardings rehearsing what he might say. To his surprise, Mr. Harding\u2019s only requests were that David keep the frail animal in his own room and dispose of it once it was either healthy enough to live on its own or dead\n\tThese conditions seemed quite fair to David; and day and night, he dedicated himself to restoring the health of Finnegan, the boy\u2019s very first friend. The puppy slept on his chest, suckled milk from a bottle, and moaned softly when David wiped his failing body. In the end, David\u2019s devotion was not nearly enough, and just six days after his rescue, the puppy\u2019s underdeveloped organs failed him. David\u2019s anguish was palpable, and Mrs. Harding, in a rare moment of compassion, suggested that Michael help David bury the poor animal in a proper manner A half-mile into the woods on the west side of town, Michael dug a hole while David wept inconsolably, clutching the tiny shoebox made coffin. When the hole was plenty deep, Michael, embarrassed, excused himself to allow David a minute alone to dispose of his beloved companion. After fifteen minutes\u2014 long after Michael had expected David to trudge back out of the woods, muddy and sobbing\u2014Michael walked annoyingly back to the burial site. He planned on telling David frankly that this was no way to act about a silly dog. Instead, Michael found the hole still empty and David nowhere to be found. Later, the police would make him repeat the story again and again",
