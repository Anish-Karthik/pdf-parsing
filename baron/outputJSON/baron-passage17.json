  "passage": "\tThis is an excerpt from Charlotte Bronte\u2019s Jane Eyre, written in 1847. Jane, previously a governess at\n\tThornfield Hall, is engaged to marry the wealthy homeowner Mr. Rochester. She fretfully relays\n\tunexpected events to him that have recently occurred in his absence.\n\t\u201cI dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the retreat of bats and owls. I thought that of all the stately front nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking. I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there over a fallen fragment of cornice. Wrapped up in a shawl, I still carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere, however tired were my arms\u2014however much its weight impeded my progress, I must retain it. I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and for a distant country. I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the summit. I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment. The blast blew so strong I could not stand. I sat down on the narrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and woke.\u201d\n\t\u201cNow, Jane, that is all.\u201d\n\t\u201cAll the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come. On waking, a gleam dazzled my eyes; I thought\u2014Oh, it is daylight! But I was mistaken; it was only candlelight. Sophie, I supposed, had come in. There was a light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a rustling there. I asked, \u2018Sophie, what are you doing?\u2019 No one answered; but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau. \u2018Sophie! Sophie!\u2019 I again cried: and still it was silent. I had risen up in bed, I bent forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my blood crept cold through my veins. Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not\u2014no, I was sure of it, and am still\u2014it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole.\u201d\n\t\u201cIt must have been one of them,\u201d interrupted my master. \u201cNo, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary. The shape standing before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me.\u201d\n\t\u201cDescribe it, Jane.\u201d\n\t\u201cIt seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long down her back. I know not what dress she had on: it was white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell.\u201d\n\t\u201cDid you see her face?\u201d\n\t\u201cNot at first. But presently she took my veil from its place; she held it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and turned to the mirror. At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass.\u201d\n\t\u201cAnd how were they?\u201d\n\t\u201cFearful and ghastly to me\u2014oh, sir, I never saw a face like it! It was a discoloured face\u2014it was a savage face. I wish I could forget the roll of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!\u201d\n\t\u201cGhosts are usually pale, Jane.\u201d\n\t\u201cThis, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes. Shall I tell you of what it reminded me?\u201d \u201cYou may.\u201d\n\t\u201cOf the foul German spectre\u2014the V\n\tampyre.\u201d\n\t\u201cAh!\u2014what did it do?\u201d\n\t\u201cSir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and flinging both on the floor, trampled on them.\u201d.",
