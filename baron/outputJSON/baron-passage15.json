  "passage": "\tBuyer\u2019s Remorse: the European Union and the Grexit Ernest Hemingway once boasted that he could tell a story in six words: \u201cFor sale: baby shoes, never worn.\u201d Nonetheless, I\u2019m not impressed; ask me to summarize something as vast as the global whole of the 20th Century, and I think I can do him four better: Europe fought. 100 years, eight Popes, and two world wars all boiled down to just those words. Europe. Fought\n\tSuch a volatile connected history makes it all the more fascinating that the entirety of the combative continent was able to redress its respective grievances, apply the salve to decades-old festering wounds, shuck off fervent nationalism, and join together in marital bliss as a veritable European Union But the honeymoon\u2014as honeymoons are wont to do\u2014has ended. The initial endorphin rush of uniting toward a greater purpose has long passed, and all of Europe now finds itself in something very much like international relationship counseling. \u201cHe can\u2019t manage our finances,\u201d Germany bemoans as the reluctant breadwinner. \u201cShe refuses to help now that I need her most,\u201d Greece exclaims. \u201cListen to you two! Y ou have no idea of the sordid sort of things that we\u2019ve seen!\u201d the rest of the continent marvels, obliged to play a role somewhere between character witness and neutral arbiter in this geopolitical lovers\u2019 quarrel. Yet, as the saying goes, \u201cbreaking up is hard to do.\u201d Now that all lowhanging fruit romantic metaphors have been exhausted, at that crossroads is where we now find ourselves Tomorrow, Greece will go before its creditors to learn its fate: either the rest of Europe (read: Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel) will extend a \u00a31.5 billion loan to the Greeks so that they might pay off a previous International Monetary Fund float, or this idyllic Mediterranean Titan of yore will finally meet its end, defaulting on its debt and hopping the next train toward the ghost town called European Banishment Such an exit (dubbed Grexit by the media, in their eminent wit) might well be the first domino to fall in a series of developments that could destabilize the region and threaten the validity and vitality of the E.U. henceforth\n\tConsequential possibilities abound. For one, should Greece receive said funding and be permitted to remain, at what point does Germany tire of paying child support? The natural conclusion to that fatigue in Berlin would be a harried rummaging through the attic in search of leftover Deutsche marks, desperate to replace the Euro and nostalgic for the autonomy of yesteryear when currency was their own and not some perverted fiscal tragedy of the commons. Moreover, the precedent is set for further disqualification with a Grexit; perhaps Spain, Portugal, Ireland, or Italy might be the next one left without a chair when the music stops, resigned to their fate as wallflowers on the outside looking in\n\tYet, perhaps the most troublesome possibility is that an isolated Greece would be an impressionable Greece\u2014desperate both for allies and access to their coffers. Current Greek optimistic sentiment is that Russia might don its shining armor and rescue the fledgling castaways with a godsend of a loan. But, given Putin\u2019s recent sleight of hand in Crimea, any such lending may not be so much an act of charity as a Trojan Horse; Vladimir\u2019s Kremlin friends are a crafty bunch, and their endgame is opaque. Alas, such is the problem with deciphering ulterior motives: they often aren\u2019t clear until the history books go to print. The trillion dollar question is, when the ink dries, will the E.U. be listed in the chapters of current events? Or, will it be relegated to the annals of academia, its skeleton but a diplomatic case study of oil and water, its ashes little more than a Kennedy School lecture on the perils of collaboration between square pegs and round holes?.",
