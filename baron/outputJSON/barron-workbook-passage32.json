This question QS$$0 has engaged critics for centuries, with some QE$$0 supporting the cause of historical accuracy and others weighing in on the side of artistic freedom. There is, to my mind, a difference between Daniel Defoe\u2019s use of the story of Alexander Selkirk, who endured four years as a castaway, to create his character Robinson QS$$1 Crusoe, and Doctorow\u2019s wholesale appropriation QS$$1 of QE$$1 historical personages such as Booker T. QE$$1 Washington and Emma Goldman, whose fame or notoriety he capitalizes on as he makes them \u201cinteract\u201d with his fictional characters.\n\t Passage SHS$$ 2\n\tWhat do SHE$$ I love best about the novels of  E. L. Doctorow? The answer to that is simple.\n\tI love the way he mixes up fact and fiction  to create something new and magical. Take Ragtime, for example. In Ragtime he throws together Emma Goldman, the anarchist; Harry Houdini, the \u201cescapologist\u201d; Sigmund Freud, the father of psychology; and Henry Ford, the father of the Model T, turning these historical figures into characters in a novel. Freud and Jung actually went to Coney Island on their visit to America. That the historians can document.\n\tDid they take a ride through the Tunnel of Love, as in the novel? Who knows? But what a fantastic idea.",
