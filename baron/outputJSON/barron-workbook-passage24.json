  "passage": "\tThe notion of a tranquil abyss had been so generally held that many investigators were initially reluctant to accept the evidence for strong currents and storms in the deep sea.\n\tThe first argument for the existence of such currents came from theory. Cold water is denser than warm water, and models of ocean circulation showed that the sinking of cold water near the poles should generate strong, deep and steady currents flowing toward the Equator. Subsequent observations not only confirmed the presence of the deep currents but also disclosed the existence of eddies on the western side of ocean basins that can be some 300 times as energetic as the mean current.\n\tPhotographs of the sea floor underlying the deep currents also revealed extensive graded beds indicative of the active transport of sediment. The final evidence for dynamic activity at great depths came from direct measurements of currents and sediments  in the North Atlantic carried out in the  HEBBLE1 program.\n\tBefore we describe the HEBBLE findings in some detail let us briefly review the sources and sinks of deep-sea sediments and the forces that activate the global patterns of ocean circulation. The sediments that end up on the ocean floor are of two main types.\n\t\tOne component is the detritus2 whose source is the weathering of rocks on continents and islands. This detritus, together with decaying vegetable matter from land plants, is carried by rivers to the edge of the continent and out onto the continental shelf, where it is picked up by marine currents. Once the detritus reaches the edge of the shelf it is carried to the base of the continental rise by gravitational processes. A significant amount of terrestrial material is also blown out to sea in subtropical regions by strong desert winds.\n\tEvery year some 15 billion tons of continental material reaches the outlets of streams and rivers. Most of it is trapped there or on the continental shelves; only a few billion tons escapes into the deep sea.\n\tThe second major component arriving at the sea floor consists of the shells and skeletons of dead microscopic organisms that flourish and die in the sunlit waters of the top 100 meters of the world\u2019s oceans. Such biological material contributes to the total inventory at the bottom about three billion tons per year. Rates of accumulation are governed by rates of biological productivity, which are controlled in part by surface currents.\n\tWhere surface currents meet they are said to converge, and where they part they are said to diverge. Zones of divergence of major water masses allow nutrient-rich deeper water to \u201coutcrop\u201d at the sunlit zone where photosynthesis and the resulting fixation of organic carbon take place. Such belts of high productivity and high rates of accumulation are normally around the major oceanic fronts (such as the region around the Antarctic) and along the edges of major  currents (such as the Gulf Stream off New England and the Kuroshio currents off Japan). Nutrient-rich water also outcrops in a zone along the Equator, where there is a divergence of two major, wind-driven gyres.\n\t1 Naval research program known as the High-Energy  Benthic Boundary-Layer Experiment.\n\t2 Debris; fragmented rock particles.",
