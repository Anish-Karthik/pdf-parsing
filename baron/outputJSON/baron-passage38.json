  "passage": "\tA Democratic Duel If one were to set out to form a nation based on democratic principles, there would be essentially two paths to take: presidential or parliamentary. Both hold their own in terms of advantages and disadvantages, and both possess the endorsement of great prosperous nations. Parliamentary is the far more common order, but many attribute its prevalence to the legacy of the British Empire rather than to its superiority\n\tThe disparity between the two is hardly subtle. In a presidential system, the executive and legislative branches of government are completely independent of one another, such as in the United States of America. The President, elected directly by the people, is a national figure that is at once the head of government and state, but is separate and distinct from Congress, the lawmaking body. On the other hand, a parliamentary system is a fusion of executive and legislative powers with the executive, most often called Prime Minister, being a member of Parliament. In the latter arrangement, members of Parliament, the legislative assembly, are elected by the people, but then choose amongst themselves the most fit to be executive. Most often, a monarch, like in Great Britain, is given the responsibility of heading the state and being the icon of national ceremony\n\tOther divergence occurs in the term limits and standards of accountability in which the executive is held to. For instance, the presidential model allows for fixed terms and scheduled elections. As such, the President enjoys the assurance of a secure term in which he or she can work to establish and meet goals for the nation\u2019s advance. Only in situations where the President is found guilty of serious crimes will he or she be removed from office before the end of the term. Conversely, the Prime Minister is subject to much more scrutiny and job insecurity Legislatures within this model of government are expected to question the Prime Minister directly on a weekly basis and are able to remove the executive any time confidence is lost in his or her ability, character, or judgment Hence, parliamentary systems are subject to random elections that can more easily replace an unfit leader\n\tAdvocates of the presidential model posit that it is more democratic because the people themselves choose their executive. They contend that the fixed terms even allow for some stability that the parliamentary organization does not allow. Likewise, a further benefit lies in the separation of powers subject to checks and balances, in which the executive and legislative bodies are able to monitor one another and assure that power is not centralized. Yet, critics of the system allow that the President\u2019s national status affords tendencies toward authoritarianism. Furthermore, as a rule, deadlocks or stalemates are much more common within a system that often has executive and legislative bodies under the control of different parties. Cynics therefore suggest that the presidential model is privy to discord and inefficiency\u2014not to mention, presidents are difficult to remove when thought to be unfit\n\tThose in favor of the parliamentary model believe that the fused government allows for unity and harmony that is all but alien within the former. Not only is it faster and easier to pass legislation, but more often than not, the government operates more cooperatively Since it is very unlikely that the ruling party will choose a Prime Minister from another party, the executive and legislative bodies are almost always working in accord. Moreover, when a Prime Minister is decided unfit, he or she can be removed and replaced right away This system, they argue, is much more efficient and less prone to corruption. Yet, not everyone agrees. With the legislature holding supreme power, critics contend that \u201ctyranny of the majority\u201d is all too likely. Not only are the people not directly electing their leader, but there is also nobody to oppose or veto legislation passed by Parliament. The minority parties have virtually no say and the ruling party of the assembly can easily manipulate when the Prime Minister will be replaced and when elections will be held\n\tThe two systems represent very different approaches to democracy, and as such, operate so. One must consider both democratic ideals and effectiveness in deciding the best way to select a leader. While presidential elections can become feeble popularity contests, centralized power is a real concern.",
