  "passage": "\tThe following passages describe the settling of the American West during the nineteenth century. The first was written by a social historian and scholar. The second comes from a widely used textbook in American history. Passage 1\n\tThe populating of nearly one billion acres of empty land west of the Mississippi occurred in a series of peristaltic waves, beginning in the 1840s and continuing for the rest of the century. First to arrive was the advance guard, the trailblazers\u2014explorers, trappers, and mountain men, hide and tallow traders, free- lance adventurers, the military. Then the set- tlers in their wagon trains lumbering over the Oregon Trail to the lush meadows of the Oregon Territory and the inland valleys of California. Next, the gold-seekers, bowling across the plains and deserts pell-mell in 1848, working up and down the California mountain ranges, then backtracking to the gold and sil- ver country in the Rockies and the Southwest. And finally, a last great wave, first by wagons, then by railroads, to mop up the leapfrogged Great Plains. By 1890 the great movement west was over, ending in a final hurrahing stampede of boomers into Oklahoma Territory, a rush of humanity that created entire towns in an afternoon. The vast, empty land demanded new tools, new social organizations, new men and women. And it produced a new canon of myths and heroes\u2014the stuff of countless dime novels, Wild West shows, movies, and televi- sion series for later generations. The heroes are familiar enough\u2014the cowboys, the law- men, the gamblers, the gold-hearted dance- hall girls, the bad men too, for heroes need evil to conquer. The western town played a\n\tpart, too, mainly as backdrop and chorus, before which the central figures enacted their agon (struggle; contest). The fictional western town was as rigidly formalized as the set for a Japanese No play\u2014the false-front stores on a dusty street lined with hitching rails, the saloons with bar, gambling tables, and stage for the dancers, the general store, the jail, and the church. The people of the chorus had a stereotypical form\u2014women in crinolines and the men in frock coats and string ties, their striped pants tucked into boots. Their lives were projected as dim, ordinary, law-abiding shadows, against which were contrasted the bold-hued dramas of the principals. These were the \u201cdecent folk,\u201d whom the heroic law- men died for; they were the meek who would inherit the set after the leading actors left and the last wild cowboy was interred in Boot Hill. Colorless, sober, conservative, salt-of-the-earth, they represented the future\u2014and a dull one it was. Occasionally, as in the film High Noon, their passive virtues were transmogrified into hypocrisy and timidity, mocking the lonely courage of the marshal they had hired to risk  his life for them. The implication was: Are these dull, cautious folk really the worthy heirs of the noble cowboys? In Steven Crane\u2019s short story The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky, the last cowboy is a drunken anachronism, wear- ing his nobility in tatters, yet not to be scorned.\n\tGO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE Passage 2\n\tIt was the miners who established the first outposts of the Far West. The discovery of gold in California had transformed that com- monwealth from a pastoral outpost of New Spain to a thriving American state and had opened up new and varied economic activi- ties\u2014farming, shipping, railroading, and man- ufacturing. That experience was to be repeated again and again in the history of the mining kingdom; in the rush to Pike\u2019s Peak country in 1859, to Alder Gulch and Last Chance in Montana and the banks of the Sweetwater in Wyoming in the middle sixties, to the Black Hills of the Dakota country in the seventies. Everywhere the miners opened up the country, established political communities, and laid the foundations for more permanent settlements. As the gold and silver played out or fell into the hands of eastern corporations and mining fever abated, the settlers would perceive the farming and stock-raising possibilities around them or find work on the railroads that were pushing in from the East and West. Some communities remained almost exclusively mining, but the real wealth of Montana and Colorado, Wyoming and Idaho, as of California, was in their grass and their soil. Even in mineral wealth the value of the pre- cious metals which had first lured adventurers was shortly exceeded by that of the copper and coal and oil which were so abundant.... Even while the miners were grubbing in the hills of Nevada and Montana, a new and more important chapter was being written in the history of the West. This was the rise of the cattle kingdom. The physical basis of the kingdom was the grasslands of the West, stretching unbroken from the Rio Grande to the northern frontier, from Kansas and Nebraska into the Rocky Mountain valleys. Here millions of buffaloes had roamed at will, but within two decades the buffalo was to become almost extinct and its place taken by even more millions of Texas longhorns and Wyoming and Montana steers....\n\tSELF-ASSESSMENT TEST / SECTION 3 31 The cattle kingdom, like the mining, had its romantic side, and the remembrance of this has persisted in the American consciousness after the cattle kingdom itself has vanished. The lonely life on the plain, the roundup, the hieroglyphic brands, the long drive, the stam- pede, the war with cattle rustlers, the splendid horsemanship, the picturesque costume designed for usefulness, not effect\u2014the wild life of the cow towns like Abilene and Cheyenne, all have found their way into American folklore and song. Children array themselves now in imitation cowboy suits, moving-picture ranchmen shoot down rustlers with unerring aim, and the whole country sings what was reputed to be President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s favorite song: Home, home on the range, Where the deer and the antelope play Where seldom is heard, a discouraging word, And the skies are not cloudy all day.",
