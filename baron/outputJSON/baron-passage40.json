  "passage": "\n\tA protein is a large, complex macromolecule composed of one or more long chains of amino acids. Proteins are 15-25% nitrogen and an equal amount of oxygen, and are present in and vital to every living cell. They are essential for the structure, function, and regulation of the body\u2019s tissues and organs. As a matter of fact, proteins hold together, protect, and provide structure to the body of a multi-celled organism. Furthermore, they are responsible for catalyzing and regulating the body chemistry. Yet, before Frederick Sanger\u2014one of only two people to ever receive two Nobel Prizes in the same category\u2014 little was known about proteins and the sequence of their amino acid chains.\n\tFrederick Sanger graduated with a doctorate in biochemistry from St. John\u2019s College in 1943, where he had spent three years researching the metabolism of the amino acid lysine. Yet, it wasn\u2019t until his work with insulin that Sanger differentiated himself in the field of chemistry. His first true accomplishment occurred when he successfully determined the complete amino acid sequence of the two polypeptide chains of bovine insulin A and B in the early 1950s. His research proved that proteins have a defined chemical composition, and he ultimately concluded that every protein had a unique sequence. In 1958, Sanger was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for showing how amino acids link together to form insulin, and, therefore, providing the tools for scientists to analyze any protein in the body. Much later, after his retirement, he would describe himself as \u201cjust a chap who messed about in a lab.\u201d\n\tFour years later, Sanger took a position as the head of the Protein Chemistry Division on the Medical Research Council, where he began to work on the sequencing of ribonucleic acid. He developed methods for separating ribonucleotide fragments generated with specific nucleases which triggered the discovery of formylmethionine tRNA, responsible for initiating protein synthesis in bacteria. Yet his earlier work with insulin helped him to form and deliberate on ideas of how DNA codes for proteins. When he turned to sequencing DNA\u2014the blueprintlike molecule that carries the genetic instructions for all living organisms\u2014Sanger collaborated with Alan Coulson to publish the \u201cPlus and Minus Technique,\u201d a sequencing procedure he developed to determine the order of the chemical bases adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine which spell out the genetic code for all living things.\n\tWhen he devised a more efficient method for reading the molecular letters that make up the genetic code in 1977, he christened it the \u201cSanger Method.\u201d The \u201cSanger Method\u201d allows long stretches of DNA to be rapidly and accurately sequenced, which earned him his second Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1980. He employed his invention to decipher the sixteen thousand letters of mitochondria. More significantly, this method eventually allowed scientists to decode the three billion letters of the human genetic code, giving science the ability to distinguish between normal and abnormal genes. In the same way, Sanger\u2019s work directly contributed to the development of biotechnology drugs like human growth hormone.\n\tIn 1986, the celebrated chemist accepted an Order of Merit. Shortly after, he helped open the Sanger Institute outside of Cambridge, which is now one of the world\u2019s largest genomic research centers. Sanger died in November 2013; his obituary documented his supreme modesty in an autobiographical account of himself as \u201cacademically not brilliant.\u201d At any rate, Sanger\u2019s research prompted the decoding of the human genome.\n\tNobel Prize Winners as of 2013",
