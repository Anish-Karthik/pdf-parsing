  "passage": "\tThe upper story of the rain forest, which we investigated, incorporates two-thirds of its volume. This region can be divided arbitrarily into a lower canopy, extending from 10 to 25 meters above the ground, an upper canopy, reaching a height of 35 meters, and an emergent zone that encompasses the tops of the tallest trees, which commonly grow to heights of more than 50 meters. The canopy is well lighted, in contrast to the forest understory, which because of thick vegetation above receives only about 1 percent of the sunlight that falls on the treetops. In the canopy all but the smallest of the rain forest trees put forth their leaves, flowers and fruit. It also contains many plants that exist entirely within its compass, forming vegetative communities that in number of species and complexity of interactions surpass any others on the earth.\n\tAmong the most conspicuous features of vegetation in the canopy of the tropical rain forest are epiphytes. About 28,000 species in 65 families are known worldwide, 15,500 of them in Central and South America; they include species of orchids, bromeliads, and arboreal cacti as well as lower plants such as lichens, mosses, and ferns. Thousands more epiphyte varieties remain unidentified.\n\tThe Greek meaning of the word epiphyte is \u201cplant that grows on a plant,\u201d and they carpet tree trunks and branches. Epiphytes sprout from seeds borne by the wind or deposited by\n\tanimals, their roots holding tight to the interstices of the bark. Yet they are nonparasitic; their hosts provide them with nothing more than a favorable position in the brightly lighted canopy. For nourishment epiphytes depend on soil particles and dissolved minerals carried in rainwater, and on aerial deposits of humus. The deposits are the product of organic debris, such as dead leaves from epiphytes and other plants, that lodges among epiphyte roots.\n\tWater is directly available to epiphytes only when it rains; other plants have continuous access to moisture trapped in the soil. As a result many epiphytes have developed features that collect and retain rainwater. Some, including orchids and arboreal cacti, have succulent stems and leaves, with spongy tissues that store water, as well as waxy leaf coatings that reduce the loss of moisture through transpiration.1 Many orchids have bulbous stem bases; other families of epiphytes impound water in tanks formed by tight rosettes of leaves or in cups shaped by the junctions of broadened petioles2 and stems. Some species possess absorbent, spongelike root masses that soak up and hold water. Bromeliads, a Central and South American family, can hold reserves of several gallons within their cisternlike bases, forming \u201carboreal swamps\u201d that attract insects of many species, earthworms, spiders, sow bugs, scorpions, tree frogs, and insect-eating birds.\n\t1  Passage of water through a plant to the atmosphere.\n\t2 Slender stalks that attach a leaf to the stem.",
