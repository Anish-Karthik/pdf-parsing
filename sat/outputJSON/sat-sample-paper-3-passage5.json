  "passage": "In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out what effect, if any, all that driving around the labyrinthine streets of London might have on cabbies\u2019 brains. When she brought sixteen taxi drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an MRI scanner, she found one surprising and important difference. The right posterior hippocampus, a part of the brain known to be involved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger than normal in the cabbies\u2014a small but very significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of that way-finding around London had physically altered the gross structure of their brains. The more years a cabbie had been on the road, the more pronounced the effect.\n\tThe brain is a mutable organ, capable\u2014within limits\u2014of reorganizing itself and readapting to new kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known as neuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the adult brain was incapable of spawning new neurons\u2014that while learning caused synapses to rearrange themselves and new links between brain cells to form, the brain\u2019s basic anatomical structure was more or less static. Maguire\u2019s study suggested the old inherited wisdom was simply not true.\n\tAfter her groundbreaking study of London cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to mental athletes. She teamed up with Elizabeth Valentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic monograph Superior Memory, to study ten individuals who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship. They wanted to find out if the memorizers\u2019 brains were\u2014like the London cabbies\u2019\u2014structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.\n\tThe researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people\u2019s faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it was possible that they might discover anatomical differences in the brains of the memory champs,\n\tevidence that their brains had somehow reorganized themselves in the process of doing all that intensive remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the imaging data, not a single significant structural difference turned up. The brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects. What\u2019s more, on every single test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes\u2019 scores came back well within the normal range. The memory champs weren\u2019t smarter, and they didn\u2019t have special brains.\n\tBut there was one telling difference between the brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects: When the researchers looked at which parts of the brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were memorizing, they found that they were activating entirely different circuitry. According to the functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be working in overdrive for the mental athletes.\n\tSurprisingly, when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first glance, this wouldn\u2019t seem to make any sense. Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in their mind\u2019s eye when they were trying to learn three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating like London cabbies when they\u2019re supposed to be remembering the shapes of snowflakes?\n\tMaguire and her team asked the mental athletes to describe exactly what was going through their minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said they were consciously converting the information they were being asked to memorize into images, and distributing those images along familiar spatial journeys. They weren\u2019t doing this automatically, or because it was an inborn talent they\u2019d nurtured since childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural activity that Maguire\u2019s fMRIs turned up were the result of training and practice.",
