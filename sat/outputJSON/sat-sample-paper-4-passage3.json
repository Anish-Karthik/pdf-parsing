  "passage": "\tTexas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle pollen from flower to flower. But \u201cwhen you advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an open communication network,\u201d says chemical ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Germany. \u201cYou attract not just the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.\u201d For a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in mere days.\n\tIn one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler took on the specific problem of the Texas gourd\u2014how to attract enough pollinators but not too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine\u2019s main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma includes 10 compounds, but the most abundant\u2014and the only one that lures squash bees into traps\u2014is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.\n\tIntuition suggests that more of that aroma should be even more appealing to bees. \u201cWe have this assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to attract a lot of pollinators,\u201d says Theis, a chemical ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee, Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn\u2019t really been tested\u2014and extra scent could well call in more beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and, throughout the August flowering season, made half the plants more fragrant by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of the plants got swabs without fragrance. 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 10 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 10 4/8/21 1:46 PM 4/8/21 1:46 PM\n\tThe new results provide a reason that Texas gourd plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: \u201cIf you really ramp up the odor, you don\u2019t get more pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by your enemies,\u201d says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist at Cornell University who was not involved in the Texas gourd study. The primary purpose of the passage is to A) discuss the assumptions and reasoning behind a\n\ttheory. B) describe the aim, method, and results of an\n\texperiment. C) present and analyze conflicting data about a\n\tphenomenon. D) show the innovative nature of a procedure used\n\tin a study. As presented in the passage, Theis and Adler\u2019s research primarily relied on which type of evidence? A) Direct observation B) Historical data C) Expert testimony D) Random sampling 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 11 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 11 4/8/21 1:46 PM 4/8/21 1:46 PM\n\tAs used in line 38, \u201ctreated\u201d most nearly means\n\tA) altered.\n\tB) restored.\n\tC) provided.\n\tD) preserved.\n\tWhat did Theis and Adler do as part of their study that most directly allowed Theis to reason that \u201cbees were repelled not by the fragrance itself\u201d (lines 70-71)?\n\tA) They observed the behavior of bees and beetles\n\tboth before and after the flowers opened in the morning. B) They increased the presence of\n\t1,4-dimethoxybenzene only during the August flowering season. C) They compared the gourds that developed from\n\tnaturally pollinated flowers to the gourds that developed from hand-pollinated flowers. D) They gave bees a chance to choose between\n\tbeetle-free enhanced flowers and beetle-free normal flowers. 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 12 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 12 4/8/21 1:46 PM 4/8/21 1:46 PM\n\tIn describing squash bees as \u201cindifferent\u201d (line 68), the author most likely means that they\n\tA) could not distinguish enhanced flowers from\n\tnormal flowers. B) visited enhanced flowers and normal flowers at\n\tan equal rate. C) largely preferred normal flowers to enhanced\n\tflowers. D) were as likely to visit beetle-infested enhanced\n\tflowers as to visit beetle-free enhanced flowers. 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 13 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 13 4/8/21 1:46 PM 4/8/21 1:46 PM",
