  "passage": "Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle pollen from flower to flower. But \u201cwhen you advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an open communication network,\u201d says chemical ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Germany. \u201cYou attract not just the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.\u201d For a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in mere days.\n\tIn one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler took on the specific problem of the Texas gourd\u2014how to attract enough pollinators but not too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine\u2019s main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma includes 10 compounds, but the most abundant\u2014and the only one that lures squash bees into traps\u2014is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.\n\tIntuition suggests that more of that aroma should be even more appealing to bees. \u201cWe have this assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to attract a lot of pollinators,\u201d says Theis, a chemical ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee, Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn\u2019t really been tested\u2014and extra scent could well call in more beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and, throughout the August flowering season, made half the plants more fragrant by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of the plants got swabs without fragrance.\n\tThe researchers also wanted to know whether extra beetles would impose a double cost by both damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with other insects and their feces. So every half hour throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to the blossoms with and without interference by beetles.\n\tFinally, they pollinated by hand half of the female flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop into fruits with the maximum number of seeds, providing a benchmark to see whether the fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles resulted in reduced pollination.\n\t\u201cIt was very labor intensive,\u201d says Theis. \u201cWe would be out there at four in the morning, three in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers open.\u201d As soon as they did, the team spent the next several hours walking from flower to flower, observing each for two-minute intervals \u201cand writing down everything we saw.\u201d\n\tWhat they saw was double the normal number of beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms. Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent, and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to visit it.\n\tThat added up to less reproduction for fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had, on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal flowers. Hand pollination didn\u2019t rescue the seed set, indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly \u2014regardless of whether they also repelled pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.) The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: \u201cIf you really ramp up the odor, you don\u2019t get more pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by your enemies,\u201d says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist at Cornell University who was not involved in the Texas gourd study.",
