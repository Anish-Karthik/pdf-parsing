  "passage": "Follow the money and you will end up in space. That\u2019s the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on mining beyond Earth.\n\tConvened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for\n\tSpace Engineering Research, the event brought together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar scientists, and government agencies that are all working to make space mining a reality.\n\tThe forum comes hot on the heels of the 2012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms. Planetary Resources of Washington says it will launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years, while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020. Another commercial venture that sprung up in 2012, Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to the moon, including to potential lunar miners.\n\tWithin a few decades, these firms may be meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital for personal electronics, such as yttrium and lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who transformed the western United States, the first space miners won\u2019t just enrich themselves. They also hope to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds with Earth, in which the materials extracted and processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered for space-based projects.\n\tIn this scenario, water mined from other worlds could become the most desired commodity. \u201cIn the desert, what\u2019s worth more: a kilogram of gold or a kilogram of water?\u201d asks Kris Zacny of HoneyBee Robotics in New York. \u201cGold is useless. Water will let you live.\u201d\n\tWater ice from the moon\u2019s poles could be sent to astronauts on the International Space Station for drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary refuelling stations.\n\tCompanies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads. Passage \tThe motivation for deep-space travel is shifting from discovery to economics. The past year has seen a flurry of proposals aimed at bringing celestial riches down to Earth. No doubt this will make a few billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain: the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could enrich us all.\n\tBut before the miners start firing up their rockets, we should pause for thought. At first glance, space mining seems to sidestep most environmental concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids, and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences \u2014both here on Earth and in space\u2014merit careful consideration.\n\tPart of this is about principles. Some will argue that space\u2019s \u201cmagnificent desolation\u201d is not ours to despoil, just as they argue that our own planet\u2019s poles should remain pristine. Others will suggest that glutting ourselves on space\u2019s riches is not an acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable ways of earthly life.\n\tHistory suggests that those will be hard lines to hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public that such barren environments are worth preserving. After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even fewer people will experience them than have walked through Antarctica\u2019s icy landscapes.\n\tThere\u2019s also the emerging off-world economy to consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely been broached\u2014and the relevant legal and regulatory framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.\n\tSpace miners, like their earthly counterparts, are often reluctant to engage with such questions. One speaker at last week\u2019s space-mining forum in Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that regulation should be avoided. But miners have much to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made insecure. It is in all of our long-term interests to seek one out.",
