  "passage": "At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father\u2019s shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.\n\tI tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass.\n\tThe glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk- wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.\n\tI saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, \u201cYour writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake.\u201d He picked up a bird shape: \u201cYour mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought.\u201d He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: \u201cYour ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet mind.\u201d\n\tAs he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? 60 I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. \u201cLook here,\u201d Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an inkstick and rotated it in the light. \u201cSee? It\u2019s the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this.\u201d And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. \u201cThe high-pitched tone tells you that the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent\u2014can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink\u2019s perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high price.\u201d\n\tI was very proud to hear Father speak of our family\u2019s ink this way.",
