His twelve daughters  acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with  Line satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of  5 a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course  knew that he must proliferate his sources of  revenue\u2014the salary he received from K. K. Harouni  for tending the tube wells would not even begin to  suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off  10 a condemned electric motor\u2014condemned by him.  He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at  the edge of his master\u2019s fields. He bought broken  radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not  demur even when asked to fix watches, though that  15 enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned  him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took  apart ever kept time again. \n\tK. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived  mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,  20 Nawab would place himself night and day at the door  leading from the servants\u2019 sitting area into the walled  grove of ancient banyan trees where the old  farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator  01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 2 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 2 4/8/21 1:46 PM 4/8/21 1:46 PM\n\t\u201cMatter, sir? O what could be the matter in your  service. I\u2019ve eaten your salt for all my years. But sir,  on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the  60 many injuries I\u2019ve received when heavy machinery  fell on me\u2014I cannot any longer bicycle about like a  bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I  first had the good fortune to enter your employment.  I beg you, sir, let me go.\u201d  65  \u201cAnd what\u2019s the solution?\u201d asked Harouni, seeing  that they had come to the crux. He didn\u2019t particularly  care one way or the other, except that it touched on  his comfort\u2014a matter of great interest to him. \n\t\u201cWell, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could  70 somehow limp along, at least until I train up some  younger man.\u201d \n\tThe crops that year had been good, Harouni felt  expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the  disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a  75 brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even  managed to extract an allowance for gasoline. \n\tThe motorcycle increased his status, gave him  weight, so that people began calling him \u201cUncle,\u201d and  asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he  80 knew absolutely nothing. He could now range  further, doing a much wider business. Best of all,  now he could spend every night with his wife, who  had begged to live not on the farm but near her  family in Firoza, where also they could educate at  85 least the two eldest daughters. A long straight road  ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way  to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni  lands. Nawab would fly down this road on his new  machine, with bags and cloths hanging from every  90 knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump,  seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial  wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to  whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears  almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his  95 arrival.  01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 3 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 3 4/8/21 1:46 PM 4/8/21 1:46 PM\n\tWhich choice best supports the claim that Nawab  performs his duties for Harouni well? \n\tA) Lines 28-32 (\u201cBy his...
