  "passage": "Long viewed by many as the stereotypical useless major, philosophy is now being seen by many students and prospective employers as in fact a very useful and practical major, offering students a host of transferable skills with relevance to the modern workplace. 34 In broad terms, philosophy is the study of meaning and the values underlying thought and behavior. But 35 more pragmatically, the discipline encourages students to analyze complex material, question conventional beliefs, and express thoughts in a concise manner.\n\tBecause philosophy 36 teaching students not what to think but how to think, the age-old discipline offers consistently useful tools for academic and professional achievement. 37 A 1994 survey concluded that only 18 percent of American colleges required at least one philosophy course. 38 Therefore, between 1992 and 1996, more than 400 independent philosophy departments were eliminated from institutions.\n\tMore recently, colleges have recognized the practicality and increasing popularity of studying philosophy and have markedly increased the number of philosophy programs offered. By 2008 there were 817 programs, up from 765 a decade before. In addition, the number of four-year graduates in philosophy has grown 46 percent in a decade. Also, studies have found that those students who major in philosophy often do better than students from other majors in both verbal reasoning and analytical 39 writing. These results can be measured by standardized test scores. On the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), for example, students intending to study philosophy in graduate school 40 has scored higher than students in all but four other majors.\n\tThese days, many 41 student\u2019s majoring in philosophy have no intention of becoming philosophers; instead they plan to apply those skills to other disciplines. Law and business specifically benefit from the complicated theoretical issues raised in the study of philosophy, but philosophy can be just as useful in engineering or any field requiring complex analytic skills. 42 That these skills are transferable across professions 43 which makes them especially beneficial to twenty-first-century students. Because today\u2019s students can expect to hold multiple jobs\u2014some of which may not even exist yet\u2014during 44 our lifetime, studying philosophy allows them to be flexible and adaptable. High demand, advanced exam scores, and varied professional skills all argue for maintaining and enhancing philosophy courses and majors within academic institutions.",
