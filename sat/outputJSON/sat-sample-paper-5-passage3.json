  "passage": "Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a V formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds that these big-winged birds carefully position their wingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird\u2019s updraft\u2014and save energy during flight.\n\tThere are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they\u2019re simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a V formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by drafting off each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. \u201cAir gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing,\u201d says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at the University of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.\n\tThe study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe. Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device\u2019s GPS determined each bird\u2019s flight position to within 30 cm, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.\n\tJust as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird\u2019s body. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think this was possible,\u201d Usherwood says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one\u2019s neighbors. \u201cPerhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down.\u201d\n\tThe findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird\u2019s energy savings because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to 30 percent less energy while flying in a V.\n\t\u201cFrom a behavioral perspective it\u2019s really a breakthrough,\u201d says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. \u201cShowing that birds care about syncing their wing beats is definitely an important insight that we didn\u2019t have before.\u201d\n\tScientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or by sensing air currents through their feathers. Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams.\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but it does suggest that there\u2019s a lot more to learn,\u201d says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, \u201cbirds are awfully good hang-glider pilots.\u201d",
