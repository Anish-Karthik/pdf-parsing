  "passage": "Building good transit isn\u2019t a bad idea, but it can actually backfire if the new trains and buses merely clear space on highway lanes for those who would prefer to drive\u2014a group that, historically, has included almost everyone with access to a car. To have environmental value, new transit has to replace and eliminate driving on a scale sufficient to cut energy consumption overall. That means that a new transit system has to be backed up by something that impels complementary reductions in car use\u2014say, the physical elimination of traffic lanes or the conversion of existing roadways into bike or bus lanes, ideally in combination with higher fuel taxes, parking fees, and tolls. Needless to say, those ideas are not popular. But they\u2019re necessary, because you can\u2019t make people drive less, in the long run, by taking steps that make driving more pleasant, economical, and productive.\n\tOne of the few forces with a proven ability to slow the growth of suburban sprawl has been the ultimately finite tolerance of commuters for long, annoying commutes. That tolerance has grown in recent decades, and not just in the United States, but it isn\u2019t unlimited, and even people who don\u2019t seem to mind spending half their day in a car eventually reach a point where, finally, enough is enough. That means that traffic congestion can have environmental value, since it lengthens commuting times and, by doing so, discourages the proliferation of still more energy-hungry subdivisions\u2014unless we made the congestion go away. If, in a misguided effort to do something of environmental value, municipalities take steps that make long-distance car commuting faster or more convenient\u2014by adding lanes, building bypasses, employing traffic-control\n\tmeasures that make it possible for existing roads to accommodate more cars with fewer delays, replacing tollbooths with radio-based systems that don\u2019t require drivers even to slow down\u2014we actually make the sprawl problem worse, by indirectly encouraging people to live still farther from their jobs, stores, schools, and doctors\u2019 offices, and by forcing municipalities to further extend road networks, power grids, water lines, and other civic infrastructure. If you cut commuting time by 10 percent, people who now drive fifty miles each way to work can justify moving five miles farther out, because their travel time won\u2019t change. This is how metropolitan areas metastasize. It\u2019s the history of suburban expansion.\n\tTraffic congestion isn\u2019t an environmental problem; traffic is. Relieving congestion without doing anything to reduce the total volume of cars can only make the real problem worse. Highway engineers have known for a long time that building new car lanes reduces congestion only temporarily, because the new lanes foster additional driving\u2014a phenomenon called induced traffic. Widening roads makes traffic move faster in the short term, but the improved conditions eventually attract additional drivers and entice current drivers to drive more, and congestion reappears, but with more cars\u2014and that gets people thinking about widening roads again. Moving drivers out of cars and into other forms of transportation can have the same effect, if existing traffic lanes are kept in service: road space begets road use.\n\tOne of the arguments that cities inevitably make in promoting transit plans is that the new system, by relieving automobile congestion, will improve the lives of those who continue to drive. No one ever promotes a transit scheme by arguing that it would make traveling less convenient\u2014even though, from an environmental perspective, inconvenient travel is a worthy goal.
