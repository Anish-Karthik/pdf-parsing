  "passage": "In 2010, as a construction crew began to tear up sidewalks in New York City\u2019s South Street Seaport to replace a water pipe, Alyssa Loorya and her team watched eagerly, picks and brushes in hand. Loorya, an urban archaeologist, studies the history of 34 cities. Any New York City construction project using municipal funds 35 are required to consider whether historical artifacts will be affected during construction, and if that possibility 36 exists or is possible, an urban archaeologist must be consulted. Since the South Street Seaport area was a bustling commercial center for early colonists, Loorya anticipated that a rich history lay beneath the pavement. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to document and recover that history before it\u2019s lost,\u201d she said.\n\tAs the work continued, 37 therefore, the team faced obstacles. Fieldwork in a city has to be done intermittently: the construction crew had to proceed one block at a time to avoid interrupting traffic, and the archaeology team\u2019s work was periodically 38 halted\u2014by stormy weather and the discovery of toxic materials underground. Moreover, as archaeologists underground attempted to relay information to those at the surface, they had to contend with the noise of construction vehicles, car horns, and 39 pedestrians\u2019 noise on the busy New York City streets. Despite these setbacks, Loorya and her team eventually began to uncover some interesting artifacts. In 2012, the team discovered a foundation wall, a network of wooden pipes, and several well bases dating to the eighteenth century. In August 2013, the archaeologists discovered thousands of objects in a single fifteen-foot stretch that was likely a garbage disposal 40 site. Including buttons from Revolutionary War uniforms, clay pipes, and an imported mineral water bottle from Germany.\n\tAs they cleaned and catalogued the artifacts, the archaeologists took stock of their findings. The team\u2019s discoveries provided a snapshot of 41 the various kinds of construction materials that were used in the eighteenth century. Colonial-era New Yorkers went to great lengths to secure fresh drinking water, Loorya noted, given the 42 effort involved in laying wooden pipes to bring in fresh water from surrounding areas, digging very deep wells, brewing alcohol to mask the water\u2019s salty taste, and even importing bottled water.\n\tThrough such discoveries, 43 they tell the story of a city\u2019s history in a new way. 44 \u201cOne of my favorite things is putting together someone\u2019s life,\u201d Loorya said.",
