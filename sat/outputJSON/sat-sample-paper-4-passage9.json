    "passage": "34 QS$$0 Popular film franchises are often \u201crebooted\u201d in an effort to make their characters and stories fresh and relevant for new audiences. Superhero comic books are periodically reworked to try to increase their appeal to contemporary readers. QE$$0 This practice is almost as 35 QS$$1 elderly QE$$1 as the medium itself and has in large part established the \u201cages\u201d that compose comic book history. The shift from the Golden to the Silver Age is probably the most successful 36 QS$$2 example: of publishers QE$$2 responding to changing times and tastes.\n\tThe start of the first (\u201cGolden\u201d) age of comic books is often dated to 1938 with the debut of Superman in Action Comics #1. Besides beginning the age, Superman in many respects defined it, becoming the model on which many later superheroes were based. His characterization, as established in Superman #1 (1939), was relatively simple. He could \u201churdle skyscrapers\u201d and \u201cleap an eighth of a mile\u201d; \u201crun faster than a streamline train\u201d; withstand anything less than a \u201cbursting shell\u201d; and 37 lift QS$$3 a car over his head. Sent QE$$3 to Earth from the \u201cdoomed planet\u201d Krypton, he was raised by human foster parents, whose love helped infuse him with an unapologetic desire to \u201cbenefit mankind.\u201d Admirable but aloof, the Golden Age Superman was arguably more paragon than character, a problem only partially solved by giving him a human alter ego. Other Golden Age superheroes were similarly archetypal: Batman was a crime-fighting millionaire, Wonder Woman a warrior princess from a mythical island.\n\tBy contrast, the second (\u201cSilver\u201d) age of comics was marked by characters that, though somewhat simplistic by today\u2019s standards, 38 were provided QS$$4 with origin stories often involving scientific experiments gone wrong. In addition QE$$4 to super villains, the new, soon-to-be-iconic characters of the 39 age: Spider-Man, QS$$5 the QE$$5 Fantastic Four, and the Hulk among them\u2014had to cope with mundane, real-life problems, including paying the rent, dealing with family squabbles, and facing anger, loneliness, and ostracism. Their interior lives were richer and their motivations more complex. Although sales remained strong for Golden Age stalwarts Superman and, to a lesser extent, Batman, 40 subsequent decades QS$$6 would show the enduring appeal of these characters.\n\tMore transformations would QE$$6 take place in the medium as the Silver Age gave way to the Bronze and Modern (and possibly Postmodern) Ages. Such efforts 41 have yielded diminishing QS$$7 returns, as QE$$7 even the complete relaunch of DC 42 Comics\u2019 superhero\u2019s, line QS$$8 in 2011 QE$$8 has failed to arrest the steep two-decade decline of comic book sales. For both commercial and, arguably, creative reasons, 43 then, no transition QS$$9 was QE$$9 more successful than 44 those from the QS$$10 Golden QE$$10 to Silver Age.\n\tSTOIf you finish before tiNe is called, you Nay checL your worL on this section only.\n\t%o not turn to any other section.
