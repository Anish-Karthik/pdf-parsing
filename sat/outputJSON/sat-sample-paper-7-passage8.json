  "passage": "\t[1] Upon the arrival of the digital camera, professional photographers harrumphed that 23 they produced ugly, low-resolution images. [2] Yet eventually the vast majority of them traded film for megapixels. [3] The latest digital cameras take pictures so crisp that the images in them appear to be die-cut. [4] Even today\u2019s humblest smartphones snap bright, sharp photos. [5] A few contemporary photographers, however, have embraced an anachronistic method that was state-of- the-art technology when it was invented in 1851: wet plate photography. 24\n\tWet plate photographers essentially create their own film. The process can be dangerous, given that it requires the use of several volatile chemicals. 25 To take a wet plate photograph, photographers usually first arrange or pose 26 it\u2019s subjects before mixing collodion (a viscous, light-sensitive chemical solution) with bromide, iodide, or chloride and applying the mixture to a clean, polished glass plate. Dried collodion is unusable, 27 so once the photo is snapped with a massive, tripod-mounted camera, the photographer has 28 nominal minutes to develop it, using more chemicals. When the image appears in the negative, water is used to stop the process. A chemical \u201cfix bath\u201d turns the negative image into a positive one. The photo is then immersed in water and warmed. 29 In conclusion, it is coated with lavender 30 oil to give it (a protective finish).\n\tWet plate photos are marvelously fine-grained and detailed, and they seem to glow with an ethereal silvery light. One misstep or a speck of dust on the glass plate, though, and flaws appear. Smudges resembling oyster shells 31 swirl around the photos\u2019 edges. Sunbursts or streaks emerge where collodion pools unevenly. Since the film requires long exposures, moving subjects blur. 32 A shifting arm or leg might even disappear because of the lengthy exposure time required. The exposure time required explains why people in wet plate photographs often look dour: it\u2019s hard to hold a smile for that long.\n\tProminent among contemporary wet plate photographers is Joni Sternbach, whose work centers, appropriately, on water and people\u2019s relationship to it. Sternbach\u2019s photo series Ocean Details, Sea/Sky, and SurfLand depict surging surfs, roiling waves, and the surfers who ride them. 33 Her subjects could be nineteenth-century wave riders, if not for the modern board shorts and bikinis they wear. Sternbach characterizes wet plate photography as \u201cone part photography, one part performance art, and one part three-ring circus,\u201d a worthwhile endeavor because it produces the unique, haunting images she seeks. \u201cWhen I look at a digital print,\u201d she says, \u201cit might be gorgeous and smooth, but it\u2019s on a piece of paper and it\u2019s one of many.\u201d",
