  "passage": "Search engines have changed the way we use the Internet, putting vast sources of information just a few clicks away. But Harvard professor of psychology Daniel Wegner\u2019s recent research proves that websites\u2014and the Internet\u2014are changing much more than technology itself. They are changing the way our memories function.\n\tWegner\u2019s latest study, \u201cGoogle Effects on Memory: Cognitive Consequences of Having Information at Our Fingertips,\u201d shows that when people have access to search engines, they remember fewer facts and less information because they know they can rely on \u201csearch\u201d as a readily available shortcut. Wegner, the senior author of the study, believes the new findings show that the Internet has become part of a transactive memory source, a method by which our brains compartmentalize information. First hypothesized by Wegner in 1985, transactive memory exists in many forms, as when a husband relies on his wife to remember a relative\u2019s birthday. \u201c[It is] this whole network of memory where you don\u2019t have to remember everything in the world yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just have to remember who knows it.\u201d Now computers and technology as well are becoming virtual extensions of our memory.\n\tThe idea validates habits already forming in our daily lives. Cell phones have become the primary location for phone numbers. GPS devices in cars remove the need to memorize directions. Wegner points out that we never have to stretch our memories too far to remember the name of an obscure movie actor or the capital of Kyrgyzstan\u2014we just type our questions into Google. \u201cWe become part of the Internet in a way,\u201d he says. \u201cWe become part of the system and we end up trusting it.\u201d\n\tWorking with researchers Betsy Sparrow of Columbia University and Jenny Liu of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, Wegner conducted four\n\t40 experiments to demonstrate the phenomenon, using various forms of memory recall to test reliance on computers. In the first experiment, participants demonstrated that they were more likely to think of computer terms like \u201cYahoo\u201d or \u201cGoogle\u201d after being 45 asked a set of difficult trivia questions. In two other experiments, participants were asked to type a collection of readily memorable statements, such as \u201cAn ostrich\u2019s eye is bigger than its brain.\u201d Half the subjects were told that their work would be saved to a 50 computer; the other half were informed that the statements would be erased. In subsequent memory testing, participants who were told their work would not be saved were best at recalling the statements. In a fourth experiment, participants typed into a 55 computer statements they were told would be saved in specific folders. Next, they were asked to recall the statements. Finally, they were given cues to the wording and asked to name the folders where the statements were stored. The participants proved 60 better able to recall the folder locations than the statements themselves.\n\tWegner concedes that questions remain about whether dependence on computers will affect memories negatively: \u201cNobody knows now what the 65 effects are of these tools on logical thinking.\u201d Students who have trouble remembering distinct facts, for example, may struggle to employ those facts in critical thinking. But he believes that the situation overall is beneficial, likening dependence on 70 computers to dependence on a mechanical hand or other prosthetic device.\n\tAnd even though we may not be taxing our memories to recall distinct facts, we are still using them to consider where the facts are located and how 75 to access them. \u201cWe still have to remember things,\u201d Wegner explains. \u201cWe\u2019re just remembering a different range of things.\u201d He believes his study will lead to further research into understanding computer dependence, and looks forward to tracing the extent 80 of human interdependence with the computer world\u2014pinpointing the \u201cmovable dividing line between us and our computers in cyber networks.\u201d Results of Experiment 4: Memory of Statements and Folder Locations Percent of participants remember statements\n\tremember statements\n\tremember folder locations and folder locations\n\tnot folder locations Adapted from Betsy Sparrow et al., \u201cGoogle Effects on Memory: Cognitive Consequences of Having Information at Our Fingertips.\u201d \u00a92011 by American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
