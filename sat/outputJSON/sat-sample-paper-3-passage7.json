    "passage": "\u201cStop them pictures!\u201d Legend has it that the corrupt politician William \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed once used those words when ordering someone to offer a bribe to Thomas Nast, an artist who had become famous for cartoons that called for reforms to end corruption. 12 QS$$0 As a result, QE$$0 Tweed\u2019s attempt to silence the artist failed, and Nast\u2019s cartoons, published in magazines like Harper\u2019s Weekly, actually played a key role in bringing Boss Tweed and his cronies to justice.\n\t13 There QS$$1 were powerful political organizations in the 1860s and the 1870s. The organizations were known as \u201cpolitical machines\u201d and started taking control of city governments. These QE$$1 political machines were able to pack legislatures and courts with hand-picked supporters by purchasing 14 votes, QS$$2 a QE$$2 form of election fraud involving the exchange of money or favors for votes. Once a political machine had control of enough important positions, its members were able to use public funds to enrich themselves and their friends. Boss Tweed\u2019s Tammany Hall group, which controlled New York 15 City QS$$3 in the 1860s\u2014stole QE$$3 more than $30 million,\n\tthe equivalent of more than $365 million today. 16 Tweed had QS$$4 been elected to a single two-year term in Congress in 1852. Tammany Hall QE$$4 was so powerful and 17 corrupt that, QS$$5 the New York Times, commented \u201cThere is QE$$5 absolutely nothing . . . in the city which is beyond the reach of the insatiable gang.\u201d\n\tGiven the extent of Tweed\u2019s power, it is remarkable that a single cartoonist could have played such a significant role in bringing about his downfall. Nast\u2019s cartoons depicted Tweed as a great big bloated thief. One of the artist\u2019s most 18 famous images showed QS$$6 Tweed QE$$6 with a bag of money in place of his 19 head. Another featured QS$$7 Tweed QE$$7 leaning against a ballot box with the caption \u201cAs long as I count the votes, what are you going to do about it?\u201d These cartoons were so effective in part because many of the citizens who supported Tweed were illiterate and thus could not read the newspaper accounts of his criminal activities. Nast\u2019s cartoons, though, widely exposed the public to the injustice of Tweed\u2019s political machine. Nast\u2019s campaign to bring down Tweed and the Tammany Hall gang was ultimately successful. In the elections of 1871, the public voted against most of the Tammany Hall candidates, greatly weakening Tweed\u2019s power. Eventually, Tweed and his gang were 20 persecuted for a QS$$8 number of QE$$8 charges, including fraud and larceny, and many of them were sent to jail. In Tweed escaped from jail and fled to Spain and unwittingly 21 brought about one QS$$9 final QE$$9 22 pinnacle for the QS$$10 power QE$$10 of political cartoons: A Spanish police officer recognized Tweed from one of Nast\u2019s cartoons. Consequently, Tweed was sent back to jail, and Nast was hailed as the man who toppled the great Tammany Hall machine.",
