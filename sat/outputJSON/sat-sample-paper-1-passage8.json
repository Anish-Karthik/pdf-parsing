  "passage": "When I left my office job as a website developer at a small company for a position that allowed me to work full-time from home, I thought I had it made: I gleefully traded in my suits and dress shoes for sweatpants and slippers, my frantic early-morning bagged lunch packing for a leisurely midday trip to my refrigerator. The novelty of this comfortable work-from-home life, however, 23 soon got worn off quickly. Within a month, I found myself feeling isolated despite having frequent email and instant messaging contact with my colleagues. Having become frustrated trying to solve difficult problems, 24 no colleagues were nearby to share ideas. It was during this time that I read an article 25 into coworking spaces.\n\tThe article, published by Forbes magazine, explained that coworking spaces are designated locations that, for a fee, individuals can use to conduct their work. The spaces are usually stocked with standard office 26 equipment, such as photocopiers, printers, and fax machines. 27 In these locations, however, the spaces often include small meeting areas and larger rooms for hosting presentations. 28 The cost of launching a new coworking business in the United States is estimated to be approximately What most caught my interest, though, was a quotation from someone who described coworking spaces as \u201cmelting pots of creativity.\u201d The article refers to a 2012 survey in which 29 64 percent of respondents noted that coworking spaces prevented them from completing tasks in a given time. The article goes on to suggest that the most valuable resources provided by coworking spaces are actually the people 30 whom use them.\n\t[1] Thus, even though I already had all the equipment I needed in my home office, I decided to try using a coworking space in my city. [2] Because I was specifically interested in coworking\u2019s reported benefits related to creativity, I chose a facility that offered a bright, open work area where I wouldn\u2019t be isolated. [3] Throughout the morning, more people appeared. [4] Periods of quiet, during which everyone worked independently, were broken up occasionally with lively conversation. \tI liked the experience so much that I now go to the coworking space a few times a week. Over time, I\u2019ve gotten to know several of my coworking 32 colleagues: another website developer, a graphic designer, a freelance writer, and several mobile app coders. Even those of us who work in disparate fields are able to 33 share advice and help each other brainstorm. In fact, it\u2019s the diversity of their talents and experiences that makes my coworking colleagues so valuable.",
