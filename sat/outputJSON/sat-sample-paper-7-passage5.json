    "passage": "\u201cPathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis,\u201d says biochemist Kim Lewis of Northeastern University. Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria\u2014even those that have developed immunity to other drugs. The scientists\u2019 best efforts to create mutant bacteria with resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it. Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic drug development during the past century. QS$$2OS$$0 But only about one percent of these organisms can be grown in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, have remained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now. QE$$2OE$$0 \u201cInstead of trying to figure out the ideal conditions for each and every one of the millions of organisms out there in the environment, to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply grow them in their natural environment where they already have the conditions they need for growth,\u201d Lewis says.\n\tTo QS$$2OS$$1 do this, the team designed a gadget that sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes, each perforated with pores that allow molecules like nutrients to diffuse through but don\u2019t allow the passage of cells. \u201cWe QE$$2OE$$1 QS$$2OS$$2 just use it to trick the bacteria into thinking that they are in their natural environment,\u201d Lewis says. The QE$$2OE$$2 team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria. Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug. Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper\n\t40 respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.\n\tIt\u2019s likely that QS$$2OS$$3 teixobactin is effective because of 45 the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics QE$$2OE$$3 target the bacteria\u2019s proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to 50 produce different structures. Passage \tMany good antibiotic QS$$9OS$$0 families\u2014penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline\u2014come from soil fungi and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if we could grow more types of bacteria from soil\u2014or 55 from exotic environments, such as deep oceans\u2014then we might find new natural antibiotics. In a recent QE$$9OE$$0 study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others] found that they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria\u2014including types that can\u2019t normally be 60 grown in the laboratory\u2014in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the bacteria reached a critical mass they could be transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued. This simple and QS$$9OS$$1 elegant methodology is their most 65 important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibiotic- producing bacteria that have never been grown before.\n\tThe first new antibiotic QE$$9OE$$1 QS$$9OS$$2 that they\u2019ve found by this 70 approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn\u2019t look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, QE$$9OE$$2 such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.\n\tSo, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. QS$$4 First, QE$$4 80 teixobactin isn\u2019t a potential panacea. It doesn\u2019t kill the Gram-negative QS$$9OS$$3 opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture QE$$9OE$$3 will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to 85 grow. And, thirdly, it\u2019s early days yet. As with any antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections, and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of 90 \u201cstandard of care treatment.\u201d That\u2019s going to take five years and \u00a3500 million and these are numbers we must find ways to reduce (while not compromising safety) if we\u2019re to keep ahead of bacteria, which can evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.",
