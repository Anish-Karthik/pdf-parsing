  "passage": "On Earth, fire provides light, heat, and comfort. Its creation, by a process called combustion, requires a chemical reaction between a fuel source and oxygen. The shape that fire assumes on Earth is a result of gravitational influence and the movement of molecules. In the microgravity environment of space, 34 moreover, combustion and the resulting fire behave in fundamentally different ways than they do on Earth\u2014differences that have important implications for researchers.\n\tA group of engineering students from the University of California at San Diego (UCSD), for example, 35 tried to find a method to make their biofuel combustion study (fuels derived from once-living material) free of the drawbacks researchers face on Earth. The standard method involves burning droplets of fuel, but Earth\u2019s gravitational influence causes the droplets to lose\n\tspherical symmetry while burning. This 36 deformation\n\tresults in subtle variations in density that both 37 causes\n\tuneven heat flow and limits the size of the droplets that\n\tcan be tested. Specially designed \u201cdrop towers\u201d 38 built\n\tfor this purpose reduce these problems, but they provide\n\tno more than 10 seconds of microgravity, and droplet\n\tsize is still too small to produce accurate models of\n\tcombustion rates. 39 The UCSD students understood\n\tthat these limitations had to be surmounted. As part of\n\tthe program, researchers fly their experiments aboard\n\taircraft that simulate the microgravity environment of\n\tspace. The aircraft accomplish this feat by flying in\n\tparabolic paths instead of horizontal ones. On the plane\u2019s\n\tascent, passengers feel twice Earth\u2019s gravitational pull, but\n\tfor brief periods at the peak of the trajectory, 40 \u201cweightlessness\u201d or microgravity similar to what is experienced in space, is achieved.\n\tThese flights allowed the UCSD students to experience microgravity 41 . Specifically, they 42 investigated the combustion of biofuel droplets in microgravity for twice as long as could be accomplished\n\tin drop towers and to perform tests with larger droplets.\n\tThe larger, 43 spherically symmetric droplets burned\n\tlonger and gave the students more reliable data on\n\tcombustion rates of biofuels because the droplets\u2019\n\tuniform shape reduced the variations in density that\n\thinder tests performed in normal gravity. The students\n\thope the new data will aid future research by improving\n\ttheoretical models of biofuel combustion. Better\n\tcombustion-rate models may even lead to the production\n\tof more fuel-efficient engines and improved 44 techniques, for fighting fires in space or at future outposts on the Moon and Mars.",
