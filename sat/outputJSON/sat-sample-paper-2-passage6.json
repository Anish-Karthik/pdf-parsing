  "passage": "Studies have shown that employees are happier, 1 healthier, and more productive when they work in an environment 0 in which temperatures are carefully controlled. New buildings may be designed with these studies in mind, but many older buildings were not, resulting in spaces that often depend primarily on artificial lighting. While employers may balk at the expense of reconfiguring such buildings to increase the amount of natural light, the investment has been shown to be well worth it in the long run\u2014for both employees and employers.\n\tFor one thing, lack of exposure to natural light has a significant impact on employees\u2019 health. A study conducted in 2013 by Northwestern University in Chicago showed that inadequate natural light could result in eye strain, headaches, and fatigue, as well as interference with the body\u2019s circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms, which are controlled by the 2 bodies biological clocks, influence body temperature, hormone release, cycles of sleep and wakefulness, and other bodily functions. Disruptions of circadian rhythms have been linked to sleep disorders, diabetes, depression, and bipolar disorder. Like any other health problems, these ailments can increase employee absenteeism, which, in turn, 3 is costly for employers. Employees who feel less than 100 percent and are sleep deprived are also less prone to work at their maximal productivity. One company in California 4 gained a huge boost in its employees\u2019 morale when it moved from an artificially lit distribution facility to one with natural illumination. 5 Artificial light sources are also costly aside from lowering worker productivity. They typically constitute anywhere from 25 to 50 percent of a building\u2019s energy use. When a plant in Seattle, Washington, was redesigned for more natural light, the company was able to enjoy annual electricity cost reductions of $500,000 6 each year.\n\tAmong the possibilities to reconfigure a building\u2019s lighting is the installation of full-pane windows to allow the greatest degree of sunlight to reach office interiors. 7 Thus, businesses can install light tubes, / . these are pipes placed in workplace roofs to capture and funnel sunlight down into a building\u2019s interior. Glass walls and dividers can also be used to replace solid walls as a means / / through distributing natural light more freely. Considering the enormous costs of artificial lighting, both in terms of money and productivity, investment in such improvements should be a natural choice for businesses.",
