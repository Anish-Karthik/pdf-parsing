  "passage": "\tLet every American, every lover of liberty, every well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the Revolution, never to violate in the least particular, the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred honor;\u2014let every man remember that to violate the law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the character of his own, and his children\u2019s liberty. Let reverence for the laws, be breathed by every American mother, to the lisping babe, that prattles on her lap\u2014let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges;\u2014let it be written in Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;\u2014let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short, let it become the political religion of the nation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars....\n\tWhen I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise, for the redress of which, no legal provisions have been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they continue in force, for the sake of example, they should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be made for them with the least possible delay; but, till then, let them if not too intolerable, be borne with. 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 14 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 14 4/8/21 1:46 PM 4/8/21 1:46 PM\n\tI do not hesitate to say, that those who call themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually withdraw their support, both in person and property, from the government... and not wait till they constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the right to prevail through them. I think that it is enough if they have God on their side, without waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already. In Passage 1, Lincoln contends that breaking the law has which consequence? A) It slows the repeal of bad laws. B) It undermines and repudiates the nation\u2019s values. C) It leads slowly but inexorably to rule by the mob. D) It creates divisions between social groups. Which choice provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question? A) Lines 9-12 (\u201clet every man... liberty\u201d) B) Lines 20-23 (\u201cand let... altars\u201d) C) Lines 33-35 (\u201cIf such... borne with\u201d) D) Lines 36-37 (\u201cThere... law\u201d) 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 15 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 15 4/8/21 1:46 PM 4/8/21 1:46 PM\n\tAs used in line 32, \u201cobserved\u201d most nearly means\n\tA) followed.\n\tB) scrutinized.\n\tC) contemplated.\n\tD) noticed.\n\tIn Passage 2, Thoreau indicates that some unjust aspects of government are\n\tA) superficial and can be fixed easily.\n\tB) subtle and must be studied carefully.\n\tC) self-correcting and may be beneficial.\n\tD) inevitable and should be endured. 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 16 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 16 4/8/21 1:46 PM 4/8/21 1:46 PM\n\tThe primary purpose of each passage is to\n\tA) make an argument about the difference between\n\tlegal duties and moral imperatives. B) discuss how laws ought to be enacted and\n\tchanged in a democracy. C) advance a view regarding whether individuals\n\tshould follow all of the country\u2019s laws. D) articulate standards by which laws can be\n\tevaluated as just or unjust. Based on the passages, Lincoln would most likely describe the behavior that Thoreau recommends in lines 64-66 (\u201cif it... law\u201d) as A) an excusable reaction to an intolerable situation. B) a rejection of the country\u2019s proper forms of\n\tremedy. C) an honorable response to an unjust law. D) a misapplication of a core principle of the\n\tConstitution. 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 17 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 17 4/8/21 1:46 PM 4/8/21 1:46 PM",
