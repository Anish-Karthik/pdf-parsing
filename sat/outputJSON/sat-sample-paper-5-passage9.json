  "passage": "\tFor an hour on the evening of October 30, 1938, Orson Welles and other performers from the Mercury Theatre flooded the airwaves with alarming \u201cnews bulletins\u201d about a Martian invasion supposedly occurring in Grover\u2019s Mill, New Jersey. They were performing a radio play adapted from The War of the Worlds, a science fiction novel by H. G. Wells. The next day, a front-page 34 headline in the New York Times declared, \u201cRadio Listeners in Panic, Taking War Drama as Fact.\u201d 35 The Times article claimed that people had fled their homes and that police stations had been swamped with calls. This version of events persisted, and the legend became that Welles\u2019s broadcast had as many as twelve million people 36 who feared that Martians had invaded Earth.\n\tRecently, however, scholars have questioned the accuracy of this legend, suggesting the degree of public hysteria has been grossly exaggerated. The authors of an article published in October 2013 go 37 so far to assign blame for the distortion to the newspaper industry. 38 At this time, Jefferson Pooley and Michael Socolow, both professors of communication studies, argue that the newspaper industry sought to discredit the newly emerging technology of radio, which was cutting into newspapers\u2019 39 profits. The newspaper industry tried to do this by portraying the new medium as irresponsible.\n\t[1] Proof of ulterior motives is scarce, 40 consequently weakening Pooley and Socolow\u2019s argument. [2] For instance, the C. E. Hooper ratings indicate that a mere 2 percent of households had tuned in to the broadcast. [3] Pooley and Socolow also call into question the validity of an oft-cited report that was based on a survey conducted six weeks after the broadcast. [4] Just because some people found the broadcast unsettling, the authors contend, doesn\u2019t mean they believed it and reacted with real terror. [5] According to this report, one million people indicated that they had been \u201cfrightened\u201d by the broadcast. [6] Ratings, however, reveal that 41 far fewer than a million people had been\n\tlistening to the broadcast. [7] Furthermore, Pooley and\n\tSocolow note that this survey \u201cconflated being\n\t\u2018frightened,\u2019 \u2018disturbed,\u2019 or \u2018excited\u2019 by the program with\n\tbeing \u2018panicked.\u2019\u201d 42\n\tPooley and Socolow describe a more likely scenario: most people who heard the broadcast understood they were listening to a piece of fiction, but 43 some being influenced by the sensationalized news coverage afterward, later \u201cremembered\u201d being more afraid than they had been. The researchers also suggest that, 44 not unlike people who got caught up in the excitement of the story when reading about it in the newspaper, the American public may have been willing to embrace the legend because of its appeal to the imagination.",
