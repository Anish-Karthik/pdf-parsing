  "passage": "Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form\u2014had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between\u2014would Chie have been more receptive?\n\tHe came on a winter\u2019s eve. He pounded on the door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought a calling card to the drawing room, for Chie.\n\tChie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides of the table so their legs were tucked inside with the heat.\n\t\u201cWho is it at this hour, in this weather?\u201d Chie questioned as she picked the name card off the maid\u2019s lacquer tray.\n\t\u201cShinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College,\u201d she read. Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air.\n\t\u201cI think you should go,\u201d said Naomi.\n\tAkira was waiting in the entry. He was in his early twenties, slim and serious, wearing the black military-style uniform of a student. As he bowed\u2014his hands hanging straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the other\u2014Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening surface of the courtyard\u2019s rain-drenched paving stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double.\n\t\u201cMadame,\u201d said Akira, \u201cforgive my disruption, but I come with a matter of urgency.\u201d\n\tHis voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face.\n\tIn the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt herself starting to like him.\n\t\u201cCome inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two.\u201d\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to trouble you. Normally I would approach you more properly but I\u2019ve received word of a position. I\u2019ve an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle\u2019s Japanese community.\u201d\n\t\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Chie said with amusement. \u201cThat is an opportunity, I\u2019m sure. But how am I involved?\u201d\n\tEven noting Naomi\u2019s breathless reaction to the name card, Chie had no idea. Akira\u2019s message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how children speak so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about things that have no importance in an adult\u2019s mind? That\u2019s how she viewed him, as a child. It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no effort to find her a husband.\n\tAkira blushed. \u201cDepending on your response, I may stay in Japan. I\u2019ve come to ask for Naomi\u2019s hand.\u201d\n\tSuddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night. \u201cDoes Naomi know anything of your . . . ambitions?\u201d\n\t\u201cWe have an understanding. Please don\u2019t judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I ask directly because the use of a go-between takes much time. Either method comes down to the same thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your consent, I become Naomi\u2019s yoshi.* We\u2019ll live in the House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to America, to secure a new home for my bride.\u201d\n\tEager to make his point, he\u2019d been looking her full in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. \u201cI see I\u2019ve startled you. My humble apologies. I\u2019ll take no more of your evening. My address is on my card. If you don\u2019t wish to contact me, I\u2019ll reapproach you in two weeks\u2019 time. Until then, good night.\u201d\n\tHe bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless grace, like a cat making off with a fish.\n\t\u201cMother?\u201d Chie heard Naomi\u2019s low voice and turned from the door. \u201cHe has asked you?\u201d\n\tThe sight of Naomi\u2019s clear eyes, her dark brows gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were preposterous.\n\t\u201cWhere did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! He thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the snap of his fingers!\u201d\n\tChie waited for Naomi\u2019s ripe laughter. Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute looking straight into Chie\u2019s eyes. Finally, she spoke. \u201cI met him at my literary meeting.\u201d\n\tNaomi turned to go back into the house, then stopped.\n\t\u201cMother.\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d \u201cI mean to have him.\u201d * a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her family\u2019s name",
