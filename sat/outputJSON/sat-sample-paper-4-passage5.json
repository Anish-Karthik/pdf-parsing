  "passage": "\tSolar panel installations continue to grow quickly, but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The poor market may be slowing innovation, but advances continue; judging by the mood this week at the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain optimistic about its long-term prospects.\n\tThe technology that\u2019s surprised almost everyone is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago, silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and Martin Green, professor at the University of New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar panel researchers, declared that they\u2019d never go below $1 a watt. \u201cNow it\u2019s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there\u2019s talk of hitting 36 cents per watt,\u201d he says.\n\tThe U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of reaching less than $1 a watt\u2014not just for the solar panels, but for complete, installed systems\u2014by 2020. Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the direct cost of solar power to six cents per kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost expected for power from new natural gas power plants.\n\tAll parts of the silicon solar panel industry have been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the power output of solar panels, and that\u2019s led to steady cost reductions. Green points to something as mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of the features on solar panels. Green\u2019s lab built a solar cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon solar cells\u2014a record that stands to this day. To achieve that record, he had to use expensive lithography techniques to make fine wires for collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual improvements have made it possible to use screen printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce lines as thin as 30 micrometers\u2014about the width of the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at costs far lower than his lithography techniques. 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 18 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 18 4/8/21 1:46 PM 4/8/21 1:46 PM\n\t'igure 1\n\tProjected Energy Cost per Megawatt-Hour in 2017  natural gas wind (onshore) conventional coal\n\tgeothermal advanced nuclear solar (photovoltaic)\n\tsolar (thermal)\n\tAverage levelized cost for plants \n\tentering service in 2017 Adapted from Peter Schwartz, \u201cAbundant Natural Gas and Oil Are Putting the Kibosh on Clean Energy.\u201d \u00a92012 by Cond\u00e9 Nast.\n\t'igure 2 Solar Photovoltaic Cost per Megawatt-Hour (MWh) (Projected beyond 2009.

For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions.\n\tSome questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole.\n\tAfter reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a\u201cNO CHANGE\u201doption. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.",
