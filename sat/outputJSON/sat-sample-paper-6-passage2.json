    "passage": "The question of what to do with null results\u2014when researchers fail to see an effect that should be detectable\u2014has long been hotly debated among those conducting medical trials, where the results can have a big impact on lives and corporate bottom lines. More recently, the debate has spread to the social and behavioral sciences, which also have the potential to sway public and social policy. There were little hard data, however, on how often or why null results were squelched. \u201cYes, it\u2019s true that null results are not as exciting,\u201d political scientist Gary King of Harvard University says. \u201cBut I suspect another reason they are rarely published is that there are many, many ways to produce null results by messing up. So they are much harder to interpret.\u201d\n\tIn a recent study, Stanford political economist Neil Malhotra and two of his graduate students examined every study since 2002 that was funded by a competitive grants program called TESS (Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences). TESS allows QS$$1 scientists QE$$1 to order up Internet-based surveys of a representative sample of US adults to test a particular hypothesis (for example, whether voters tend to favor legislators who boast of bringing federal dollars to their districts over those who tout a focus on policy matters).\n\tMalhotra\u2019s team tracked down working papers from most of the experiments that weren\u2019t published, and for the rest asked grantees what had happened to their results. In their QS$$10OS$$0 e-mailed responses, some scientists cited deeper problems with a study or more pressing matters\u2014but many also believed the journals just wouldn\u2019t be interested. \u201cThe unfortunate QE$$10OE$$0 QS$$10OS$$1 reality of the publishing world [is] that null effects do not tell a clear story,\u201d said one scientist. Said another, QS$$6OS$$0 QE$$10OE$$1 \u201cNever published, definitely disappointed to not see any major effects.\u201d\n\tTheir answers suggest QS$$4OS$$0 QE$$6OE$$0 to Malhotra that rescuing findings from the file drawer will require a shift in expectations. \u201cWhat needs to QE$$4OE$$0 change is the culture\u2014the author\u2019s belief about what will happen if the research is written up,\u201d he says.\n\tNot unexpectedly, the statistical QS$$10OS$$2 strength of the findings QS$$2 made QE$$2 a huge difference in whether they were ever published. Overall, 42% of the QS$$6OS$$1 QE$$10OE$$2 experiments produced statistically significant results. Of those, 62% were ultimately published, compared with 21% of the null results. However, the Stanford QE$$6OE$$1 team QS$$4OS$$1 was surprised that researchers didn\u2019t even write up 65% of the experiments that yielded a null finding.\n\tScientists not involved in the QE$$4OE$$1 study praise its \u201cclever\u201d design. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important paper\u201d QS$$10OS$$3 that \u201cstarts to put numbers on things we want to understand,\u201d says economist Edward Miguel of the University of California, Berkeley.\n\tHe and others note that the QS$$4OS$$2 QE$$10OE$$3 bias against null studies can waste time and money when researchers devise new studies replicating strategies already found to be ineffective. Worse, if researchers publish significant results QE$$4OE$$2 QS$$4OS$$3 from similar experiments in the future, they could look stronger than they should because the earlier null studies are ignored. Even more troubling to Malhotra was QE$$4OE$$3 QS$$6OS$$2 the fact that two scientists whose initial studies \u201cdidn\u2019t work out\u201d went on to publish results based on a smaller sample. \u201cThe non-TESS version of the same study, in which we used a student sample, did yield fruit,\u201d noted one investigator.\n\tA registry for data generated by all QE$$6OE$$2 QS$$6OS$$3 experiments would address these problems, the authors argue. They say it should also include a \u201cpreanalysis\u201d plan, that is, a detailed description of what the scientist hopes to achieve and how the data will be analyzed. Such plans would help deter researchers from QE$$6OE$$3 tweaking their analyses after the data are collected in search of more publishable results.\n\tFates of Social Science Studies by Results strong results\n\tmixed results\n\tnull results (42% of total)\n\t(36% of total)\n\t(22% of total) published in top journal published in non-top journal unpublished but written unwritten Adapted from Annie Franco, Neil Malhotra, and Gabor Simonovits, \u201cPublication Bias in the Social Sciences: Unlocking the File Drawer.\u201d \u00a92014 by American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
