    "header": "These passages are adapted from the Lincoln\u2011Douglas debates. Passage 1 is from a statement by Stephen Douglas. Passage 2 is from a statement by Abraham Lincoln. Douglas and Lincoln engaged in a series of debates while competing for a US Senate seat in 1858. Passage",
    "passage": "Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together, to a house divided against itself, and says that it is contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand. When did he learn, and by what authority does he proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided into Free and Slave States from its organization up to this day. During that period we have increased from four millions to thirty millions of people; QS$$2OS$$0 we have extended our territory from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our geographical extent; we have increased in population, in wealth, and in power beyond any example on earth; QE$$2OE$$0 we have risen from a weak and feeble power to become the terror and admiration of the civilized world; and all this has been done under a Constitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says is in violation of the law of God; and under a Union divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln thinks, because of such division, cannot stand. Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who framed the Government. . . .\n\tI QS$$2OS$$1 QS$$9 now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it? QE$$2OE$$1 It can thus exist if each State will QE$$9 carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded; to wit, the right of each State to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this Union will not only live forever, but it will extend and expand until it covers the whole continent, and makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-bound Republic. We QS$$2OS$$2 must bear in mind that we are yet a young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in the history of the world, that our national increase is great, and that the emigration from the old world is increasing, requiring QE$$2OE$$2 us to expand and acquire new territory from time to time, in order to give our people land to live upon. If QS$$2OS$$3 we live upon the principle\n\tof State rights and State sovereignty, each State regulating its own affairs and minding its own business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just as fast and as far as we need the territory. . . QE$$2OE$$3 . Passage \tIn complaining of what I said in my speech at Springfield, in which he says I accepted my nomination for the Senatorship . . . he again quotes that portion in which I said that \u201ca house divided against itself cannot stand.\u201d Let me say a word in regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face of the country, and the difference in the natural features of the States. I agree QS$$5OS$$0 to all that. Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty among us? Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate the commerce that springs from the production of sugar? Or because QE$$5OE$$0 we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this State? Have they produced any differences? Not at all. They are the very cements of this Union. They don\u2019t QS$$5OS$$1 make the house a \u201chouse divided against itself.\u201d They are the props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.\n\tBut has it QE$$5OE$$1 been so with this element of slavery? QS$$3 Have QE$$3 we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it? Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has QS$$5OS$$2 been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All the trouble QE$$5OE$$2 and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory acquired by the Mexican War; and it is so now. Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there has been agitation and resistance. . . . Do you think QS$$5OS$$3 that the nature of man QS$$6 will QE$$6 be changed, that the same causes that produced agitation at one time will not have the same effect at another? QE$$5OE$$3",
