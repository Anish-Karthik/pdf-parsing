  "passage": "Paleontologists are using modern technology to gain a greater understanding of the distant past. With the aid of computed tomography (CT) scanning and 3-D printing, researchers are able to create accurate models of prehistoric fossils. 1 These models have expanded\n\tresearchers\u2019 knowledge of ancient species and 2 swear\n\tto advance the field of paleontology in the years to come.\n\tCT scanners use X-rays to map the surface of a fossil in minute detail, recording as many as one million data points to create a digital blueprint. A 3-D printer then builds a polymer model based on this blueprint, much as a regular computer printer reproduces digital documents on paper. 3 Whereas the head of an ordinary computer printer moves back and forth while printing ink onto paper, the corresponding part of a 3-D printer moves in multiple dimensions while squirting out thin layers of melted polymer plastic. The plastic hardens quickly, 4 it allows the printer to build the layers of the final model. Compared with older ways of modeling fossils, scanning and printing in this way is extremely versatile. [1] One significant benefit of 3-D printing technology is its ability to create scale reproductions of fossils. [2] But now 3-D scale models can be rearranged with ease, which is a huge boon to scientists. [3] A team led by Drexel University professor Kenneth Lacovara is making models of dinosaur bones one-tenth the bones\u2019 original sizes 5 in order to learn how they fit together when the animals were alive. [4] In the past, such research was limited by the weight and bulk of the fossils as well as 6 its preciousness and fragility. [5] In many cases, scientists had to rearrange bones virtually, using artists\u2019 renderings. \tBecause CT scanners can map objects that are impossible to excavate, CT scanning and 3-D printing can also be used to reproduce fossils that scientists cannot observe firsthand. 8 By contrast, researchers\n\tfrom the National Museum of Brazil 9 has relied on\n\tthis technique to study a fossilized skeleton that was\n\tdiscovered protruding from a rock at an old S\u00e3o Paulo\n\trailroad site. 10 The fossil was too delicate to be\n\tremoved from the rock. Because of the fossil\u2019s delicate\n\tnature, the team dug up a block of stone around the fossil\n\tand brought it to their lab. With the aid of a CT scanner\n\tand a 3-D printer, they were able to produce a resin\n\tmodel of the fossil. Examining the model, the researchers\n\tdetermined that 11 one had found a new species, a\n\t75-million-year-old crocodile. While not every discovery\n\twill be as dramatic as this one, paleontologists anticipate\n\tfurther expanding their knowledge of ancient life-forms\n\tas CT scanning and 3-D printing continue to make fossils\n\tmore accessible.",
