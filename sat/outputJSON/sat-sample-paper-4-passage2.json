  "passage": "\tThe news is a form of public knowledge.  Unlike personal or private knowledge (such as the  health of one\u2019s friends and family; the conduct of a  Line private hobby; a secret liaison), public knowledge  5 increases in value as it is shared by more people. The  date of an election and the claims of rival candidates;  the causes and consequences of an environmental  disaster; a debate about how to frame a particular  law; the latest reports from a war zone\u2014these are all  10 examples of public knowledge that people are  generally expected to know in order to be considered  informed citizens. Thus, in contrast to personal or  private knowledge, which is generally left to  individuals to pursue or ignore, public knowledge is  15 promoted even to those who might not think it  matters to them. In short, the circulation of public  knowledge, including the news, is generally regarded  as a public good which cannot be solely  demand-driven.  20  The production, circulation, and reception  of public knowledge is a complex process. It is  generally accepted that public knowledge should  be authoritative, but there is not always  common agreement about what the public needs to  25 know, who is best placed to relate and explain it, and  how authoritative reputations should be determined  and evaluated. Historically, newspapers such as The  Times and broadcasters such as the BBC were widely  regarded as the trusted shapers of authoritative  30 agendas and conventional wisdom. They embodied  the Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s definition of  authority as the \u201cpower over, or title to influence, the  opinions of others.\u201d As part of the general process of  the transformation of authority whereby there has  35 been a reluctance to uncritically accept traditional  sources of public knowledge, the demand has been  for all authority to make explicit the frames of value  which determine their decisions. Centres of news  production, as our focus groups show, have not been  40 exempt from this process. Not surprisingly perhaps  some news journalists feel uneasy about this  renegotiation of their authority:  01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 6 01853-076-2021-22-SAT-PRACTICE TEST-PR-WR-3.indd 6 4/8/21 1:46 PM 4/8/21 1:46 PM\n\tPercentage of Respondents Seeing News Stories \n\tas Inaccurate or Favoring One Side  News organizations...
