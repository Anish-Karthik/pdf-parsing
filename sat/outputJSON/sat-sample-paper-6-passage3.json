  "passage": "Inflexible old salt becomes a softy in the nanoworld, stretching like taffy to more than twice its length, researchers report. The findings may lead to new approaches for making nanowires that could end up in solar cells or electronic circuits. The work also suggests that these ultra-tiny salt wires may already exist in sea spray and large underground salt deposits.\n\t\u201cWe think nanowires are special and go to great lengths to make them,\u201d says study coauthor Nathan Moore of Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque. \u201cMaybe they are more common than we think.\u201d\n\tMetals such as gold or lead, in which bonding angles are loosey-goosey, can stretch out at temperatures well below their melting points. But scientists don\u2019t expect this superplasticity in a rigid, crystalline material like salt, Moore says.\n\tThis unusual behavior highlights that different forces rule the nanoworld, says theoretical physicist Krzysztof Kempa of Boston College. \u201cForget about gravity. It plays no role,\u201d he says. Surface tension and electrostatic forces are much more important at this scale.\n\tMoore and his colleagues discovered salt\u2019s stretchiness accidently. They were investigating how water sticks to a surface such as salt and created a super-dry salt sample for testing. After cleaving a chunk of salt about the size of a sugar cube with a razor, the scientists guided a microscope that detects forces toward the surface. When the tip was far away there was no measured force, but within about seven nanometers a very strong attraction rapidly developed between the diamond tip of the microscope and the salt. The salt actually stretched out to glom on to the microscope tip. Using an electron microscope to see what was happening, the researchers observed the nanowires.\n\tThe initial attraction between the tip and salt might be due to electrostatic forces, perhaps good old van der Waals interactions,1 the researchers\n\tspeculate. Several mechanisms might lead to the elasticity, including the excessive surface tension found in the nanoworld (the same tension that allows a water strider to skim the surface of a pond).\n\tThe surface tension is so strong that as the microscope pulls away from the salt, the salt stretches, Kempa says. \u201cThe inside has no choice but to rearrange the atoms, rather than break,\u201d he says.\n\tThis bizarre behavior is actually mirrored in the macroworld, the researchers say. Huge underground deposits of salt can bend like plastic, but water is believed to play a role at these scales. Perhaps salty nanowires are present in these deposits as well.\n\t\u201cSodium chloride2 is everywhere\u2014in the air, in our bodies,\u201d Moore says. \u201cThis may change our view of things, of what\u2019s happening at the nanoscale.\u201d\n\tThe work also suggests new techniques for making nanowires, which are often created through nano-imprinting techniques, Kempa says. \u201cWe invoke the intuition of the macroworld,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe instead of stamping [nanowires] we should be nano-pulling them.\u201d 1 Attractive forces between nearby atoms 2 Common salt Interaction of Microscope Tip with Salt Surface Force on tip (micronewtons)\n\ttip moving toward\n\tsalt surface P\n\tQ R Force on tip (micronewtons)\n\ttip moving away from salt surface S\n\tT Distance from tip to surface (nanometers) Adapted from Moore et al., \u201cSuperplastic Nanowires Pulled from the Surface of Common Salt.\u201d \u00a92009 by American Chemical Society.",
