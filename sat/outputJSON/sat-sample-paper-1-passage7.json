  "passage": "Most of Greenland\u2019s interior is covered by a thick layer of ice and compressed snow known as the Greenland Ice Sheet. The size of the ice sheet fluctuates seasonally: in summer, average daily high temperatures in Greenland can rise to slightly above 50 degrees Fahrenheit, partially melting the ice; in the winter, the sheet thickens as additional snow falls, and average daily low temperatures can drop to as low as 20 degrees.\n\tAverage Daily High and Low Temperatures Recorded at Nuuk Weather Station, Greenland (1961\u20141990) Mar 5\n\tJun 10\n\tSep 8 Temperature (\u00b0F)\n\tMay Mar Apr Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jun Jul Jan Feb\n\taverage daily high average daily low Adapted from WMO. \u00a92014 by World Meteorological Organization.\n\tTypically, the ice sheet begins to show evidence of thawing in late summer. This follows several weeks of higher temperatures. For example, in the summer of 2012, virtually the entire Greenland Ice Sheet underwent thawing at or near its surface by mid-July, the earliest date on record. Most scientists looking for the causes of the Great Melt of 2012 have focused exclusively on rising temperatures. The summer of 2012 was the warmest in 170 years, records show. But Jason Box, an associate professor of geology at Ohio State believes that another factor added to the early thaw; the \u201cdark snow\u201d problem. According to Box, a leading Greenland expert, tundra fires in 2012 from as far away as North America produced great amounts of soot, some 17 of it drifted over Greenland in giant plumes of smoke and then 18 fell as particles onto the ice sheet. Scientists have long known that soot particles facilitate melting by darkening snow and ice, limiting 19 it\u2019s ability to reflect the Sun\u2019s rays. As Box explains, \u201cSoot is an extremely powerful light absorber. It settles over the ice and captures the Sun\u2019s heat.\u201d The result is a self-reinforcing cycle. As the ice melts, the land and water under the ice become exposed, and since land and water are darker than snow, the surface absorbs even more heat, which 20 is related to the rising temperatures.\n\t[1] Box\u2019s research is important because the fires of 2012 may not be a one-time phenomenon. [2] According to scientists, rising Arctic temperatures are making northern latitudes greener and thus more fire prone. [3] The pattern Box observed in 2012 may repeat 21 itself again, with harmful effects on the Arctic ecosystem. [4] Box is currently organizing an expedition to gather this crucial information. [5] The next step for Box and his team is to travel to Greenland to perform direct sampling of the ice in order to determine just how much the soot is contributing to the melting of the ice sheet. [6] Members of the public will be able to track his team\u2019s progress\u2014and even help fund the expedition\u2014through a website Box has created. 22",
