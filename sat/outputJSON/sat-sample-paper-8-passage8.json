    "passage": "Marsupials (mammals that carry their young in a pouch) are a curiosity among biologists because they lack a corpus callosum, the collection of nerve fibers connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. In most other mammals, the left hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body, the right hemisphere controls the left, and the corpus callosum allows communication between the hemispheres. Scientists 23 QS$$0 are long believing QE$$0 that this structure enables complex tasks by sequestering skilled movement to a single hemisphere without sacrificing coordination between both sides of the body; this sequestration would explain handedness, the tendency to consistently prefer 24 QS$$1 one hand over the other, QE$$1 in humans. However, a recent finding of handedness in marsupials suggests that a 25 QS$$2 trait QE$$2 other than the presence of a corpus callosum 26 QS$$3 links as QE$$3 handedness: bipedalism.\n\tResearchers at Saint Petersburg State University and the University of Tasmania observed marsupials walking on either two legs (bipeds) or four (quadrupeds) and performing tasks such as bringing food to their mouths. The scientists employed a mean handedness index; 27 negative QS$$4 scores indicated a left-forelimb preference and positive scores indicated a right-forelimb preference. While QE$$4 eating, the eastern gray kangaroo, red-necked wallaby, red 28 kangaroo QS$$5 and, brush-tailed QE$$5 bettong, all bipedal marsupials, preferred using their left forelimb, as revealed by 29 positive QS$$6 mean handedness index values less than 0.2 for QE$$6 all four species. These results suggest handedness among these animals.\n\tMean Handedness Index Scores of One-Handed Feeding\n\tin Bipedal Marsupials\n\tleft-forelimb preference index handedness \n\t\u20130.right-forelimb preference  n a e M\n\tbrush- red red- eastern tailed kangaroo necked gray bettong wallaby kangaroo\n\tBipedal marsupial Adapted from Andrey Giljov et al., \u201cParallel Emergence of True Handedness in the Evolution of Marsupials and Placentals.\u201d \u00a92015 by Elsevier Ltd. 30 Having four feet, quadrupedal marsupials in the study did not show a strong preference for the use of one forelimb. For instance, gray short-tailed opossums and sugar gliders were assigned mean handedness values very close to zero\u2014they used their right and left forelimbs nearly equally. In effect, the study provided no evidence of handedness among quadrupedal marsupials.\n\t31 Kangaroos, though, still do not exhibit handedness to the extent that humans do. As the researchers noted, the quadrupeds typically live in trees and employ all four limbs in climbing. The bipeds, on the other hand, are far less arboreal, leaving their forelimbs relatively free for tasks in 32 whom handedness may confer an evolutionary advantage. Why the majority of marsupials studied preferred their left forelimbs while the majority of humans prefer their right remains a mystery, however, 33 as does the mechanism by which, in the absence of a corpus callosum, the hemispheres of the marsupial brain communicate.",
