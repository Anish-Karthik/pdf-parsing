Researchers are  investigating this feat partly to learn more about  humans\u2019 comparatively limited abilities to  regenerate, and they\u2019re making exciting progress. An  especially promising discovery is that both humans  and panther worms have a gene for early growth  response (EGR) linked to regeneration.

However, as the team pointed  out, the gene likely functions very differently in  humans than it does in panther worms.
