  "passage": "[1] Sixty miles north of Guam and more than 1,700 feet under the ocean\u2019s surface is the summit of NW Rota-1, an undersea volcano discovered in 2003. [2] Surprisingly, the volcano appears to have been continuously active; it even grew 130 feet in height between 2006 and 2009. [3] Yet despite the hostile environment created by the constant volcanic activity, life is thriving there. [4] Special adaptations are the key to survival. [5] At that depth, water pressure suppresses the explosive force of the volcano\u2019s eruptions, allowing scientists to 1 watch and observe them up close via\n\tremotely operated vehicles. 2\n\tNW  Rota-1  is  far  below  the  ocean\u2019s  photic  zone  where  sunlight  drives  photosynthesis;  3  nevertheless,  bacteria  supporting  a  unique  food  web  have  adapted  to  this  perpetually  dark  environment.  The  bacteria  have  evolved  to  use  hydrogen  sulfide  instead  of  sunlight  for  the  energy  that  drives  their  metabolic  processes,  and  hydrothermal  venting  is  the  source  of  the  chemical  soup  necessary  to  support  4  him  or  her.  Seawater  seeping  into  fissures  in  the  ocean  floor  is  heated  by  underlying  magma,  and  the  heat  drives  chemical  reactions  that  remove  oxygen,  sulfates,  5  and  remove  other  chemicals  from  the  water.  Once  the  superheated  water  (up  to  750\u00b0F)  rises  through  vents  in  the  ocean  floor,  additional  reactions  cause  minerals  and  compounds  to  precipitate  onto  the  seafloor,  where  bacteria  feed  on  them. Loihi shrimp\u2014originally thought to exist only around an undersea volcano near 6 Hawaii, survive by using tiny, shear-like claws to harvest rapidly growing bacterial filaments covering rocks near NW Rota-1\u2019s hydrothermal vents. The Loihi shrimp spend most of their time grazing on the bacteria and evading another, previously unknown, species of shrimp. Shrimp of that species also graze on bacterial filaments as juveniles, 7 resulting from their ability to cope with the noxious environment around the volcano. They feed on the Loihi shrimp and other organisms that are overcome by the toxic plumes of volcanic gas and ash.\n\tDuring an underwater eruption, steam quickly 8 condenses. The steam leaves only carbon dioxide bubbles and droplets of molten sulfur. This means that the water near NW Rota-1 is more acidic than 9 that of stomach acid, presenting yet another challenge to life-forms living nearby. As the carbon dioxide level in Earth\u2019s atmosphere rises, the 10 worlds\u2019 ocean\u2019s absorb more carbon 11 dioxide. Organisms flourishing near the volcano may help biologists understand how life adjusts to very acidic conditions. In addition, NW Rota-1 is a natural laboratory where scientists can study conditions that may be similar to those that gave rise to life on Earth and perhaps even other worlds.",
