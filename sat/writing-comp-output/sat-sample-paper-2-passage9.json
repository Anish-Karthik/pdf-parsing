These works QE$$0 by human artists have favored representations of members of their own species to those of other species. Indeed, when we think about animals depicted in well-known works of art, the image of dogs playing poker\u2014popularized in a series of paintings by American artist C. M. 13 QS$$1 Coolidge, QE$$1 may be the first and only one that comes to mind. Yet some of the earliest known works of art, including paintings and drawings tens of thousands of years old found on cave walls in Spain and France, 14 QS$$2 portrays QE$$2 animals. Nor has artistic homage to our fellow creatures entirely died out in the millennia since, 15 QS$$3 despite the many years that have passed between then and now. QE$$3 \n\t[1] The State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, one of Russia\u2019s greatest art museums, has long had a productive partnership with a much loved animal: the cat. [2] For centuries, cats have guarded this famous museum, ridding it of mice, rats, and other rodents that could damage the art, not to mention 16 QS$$4 scared QE$$4 off visitors. [3] Peter the Great introduced the first cat to the Hermitage in the early eighteenth century. [4] Later Catherine the Great declared the cats to be official guardians of the galleries. [5] Continuing the tradition, Peter\u2019s daughter Elizaveta introduced the best and strongest cats in Russia to the Hermitage. [6] Today, the museum holds a yearly festival honoring these faithful workers. These cats are so cherished by the museum that officials recently 2. QS$$6 decreed QE$$6 original paintings to be made of six of them. In each, a cat is depicted upright in a humanlike pose and clothed in imperial-era Russian attire. The person chosen for this 2/ QS$$7 task, digital artist, Eldar Zakirov QE$$7 painted the cats in the style traditionally used by portrait artists, in so doing 20 QS$$8 presenting the cats as noble individuals worthy of respect. QE$$8 One portrait, The Hermitage Court Chamber Herald Cat, includes an \n\taristocratic tilt of feline ears as well as a stately sweep of \n\ttail emerging from the stiff scarlet and gold of royal court \n\tdress. The wise, thoughtful green eyes of the subject of \n\tThe Hermitage Court Outrunner Cat mimic those of a \n\ttrusted royal advisor. 21 Some may find it peculiar to \n\tobserve cats portrayed in formal court poses, but these \n\tfelines, by 22 QS$$10 mastering the art of killing mice and rats, QE$$10 \n\tare benefactors of the museum as important as any \n\thuman.",
