    "passage": "The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. QS$$2OS$$0 Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it\u2019s sure that the QS$$3 dawdling insect QE$$3 visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. QE$$2OE$$0 QS$$2OS$$1 The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring the trap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. QE$$2OE$$1 QS$$2OS$$2 If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action. QE$$2OE$$2 QS$$4 \n\tWe can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. QS$$2OS$$3 First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn\u2019t know what) has touched one of its hairs. QE$$2OE$$3 Then it stores this information for a number of seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn\u2019t close, and the ant QS$$3 happily meanders QE$$3 on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the QS$$3 unassuming bug\u2019s QE$$3 encounter with the first hair? How does it remember the first touch in order to react upon the second? QE$$4 \n\tScientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson\u2019s early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882. A century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity. In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this coupling of action potentials and the opening of \n\tcalcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions. \n\tThey proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don\u2019t happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won\u2019t be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost. \n\tSubsequent research supports this model. QS$$9OS$$0 Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first QS$$7 demonstrated QE$$7 that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. QE$$9OE$$0 QS$$9OS$$1 To test the model they rigged up very fine electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. QE$$9OE$$1 QS$$9OS$$2 This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn\u2019t measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). QE$$9OE$$2 QS$$9OS$$3 When they modified this experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. QE$$9OE$$3 As long as fourteen microcoulombs\u2014a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons together\u2014flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open.",
