    "passage": "QS$$3OS$$0 Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly, but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. QE$$3OE$$0 The QS$$1 poor QE$$1 market may be slowing innovation, but advances continue; judging by the mood this week at the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain optimistic about its long-term prospects. \n\tThe technology that\u2019s surprised almost everyone is conventional crystalline silicon. QS$$3OS$$1 A few years ago, silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and Martin Green, professor at the University of New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar panel researchers, declared that they\u2019d never go below $1 a watt. QE$$3OE$$1 \u201cNow it\u2019s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there\u2019s talk of hitting 36 cents per watt,\u201d he says. \n\tThe U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of reaching less than $1 a watt\u2014not just for the solar panels, but for complete, installed systems\u2014by 2020. Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target even sooner than that. QS$$3OS$$2 If so, that would bring the direct cost of solar power to six cents per kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost expected for power from new natural gas power plants. QE$$3OE$$2 QS$$3OS$$3 \n\tAll parts of the silicon solar panel industry have been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the power output of solar panels, and that\u2019s led to steady cost reductions. QE$$3OE$$3 Green points to something as mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of the features on solar panels. Green\u2019s lab built a solar cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon solar cells\u2014a record that stands to this day. To achieve that record, he had to use expensive lithography techniques to make fine wires for collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual improvements have made it possible to use screen printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce lines as thin as 30 micrometers\u2014about the width of the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at costs far lower than his lithography techniques. \n\tMeanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass, which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar cell they made is the only current challenger to silicon in terms of large-scale production\u2014thin-film cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power cheaper. \n\tOne of Green\u2019s former students and colleagues, Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer China Sunergy, announced this week that he is building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided solar cell that can absorb light from both the front and back. QS$$5OS$$0 The basic idea, which isn\u2019t new, is that during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the land between rows of solar panels in a solar power plant. QE$$5OE$$0 QS$$5OS$$1 That light reflects onto the back of the panels and could be harvested to increase the power output. QE$$5OE$$1 QS$$5OS$$2 This works particularly well when the solar panels are built on sand, which is highly reflective. QE$$5OE$$2 QS$$5OS$$3 Where a one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. QE$$5OE$$3 He expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more electricity over the course of a year. \n\tEven longer-term, Green is QS$$6 betting on QE$$6 silicon, aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels by combining silicon with one or two other semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn\u2019t convert efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to around 40 percent. Adding another could make efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which would cut in half the number of solar panels needed for a given installation. The challenge is to produce good connections between these semiconductors, something made challenging by the arrangement of silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.",
