Passage is adapted from Harriet Taylor Mill, \u201cEnfranchisement of Women.\u201d Originally published in 1851. As United States and European societies grew increasingly democratic during the nineteenth century, debates arose about whether freedoms enjoyed by men should be extended to women as well.\u00a0",
    "passage": "Passage1 I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect that great inequality of man and woman which has seemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will QS$$0 raise QE$$0 woman and make her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range. QS$$2OS$$0 \n\tThere are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. QE$$2OE$$0 QS$$2OS$$1 They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant to both the same rights; QE$$2OE$$1 they would mix them in all things\u2014their occupations, their pleasures, their business. QS$$2OS$$2 It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; QE$$2OE$$2 and from so preposterous a medley of the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women. QS$$2OS$$3 \n\tIt is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. QE$$2OE$$3 They admit, that as nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold \n\tthat improvement does not consist in making beings so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the QS$$9 great principle of political economy QE$$9 which governs the manufactures of our age, by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on. Passage2 QS$$5OS$$0 As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; QE$$5OE$$0 association grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; QS$$5OS$$1 two persons could hardly co\u00f6perate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law\u2019s appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other. QE$$5OE$$1 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the QS$$3 dominion QE$$3 of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, QS$$5OS$$2 in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. QE$$5OE$$2 . . . largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete liberty of choice. . . . QS$$7 Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and QS$$5OS$$3 employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. QE$$5OE$$3 QE$$7 There need be no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,\u2014by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.",
