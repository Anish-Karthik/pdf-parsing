Passage 2 is adapted from Mary Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Originally published in 1792. Talleyrand was a French diplomat; the Report was a plan for national education. Wollstonecraft, a British novelist and political writer, wrote Vindication in response to Talleyrand.\u00a0",
    "passage": "Passage1 That half the human race is excluded by the other half from any participation in government; that they are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land where they were born; and that QS$$2OS$$0 they are property-owners yet have no direct influence or representation: QE$$2OE$$0 are all political phenomena apparently impossible to explain on abstract principle. But on another level of ideas, the question changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose of all these institutions must be the happiness of the greatest number. Everything that leads us farther from this purpose is in error; everything that brings us closer is truth. QS$$2OS$$1 If the exclusion from public employments decreed against women leads to a greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes, then this becomes a law that all Societies have been compelled to acknowledge and sanction. QE$$2OE$$1 \n\tAny other ambition would be a reversal of our primary destinies; and it will never be in women\u2019s interest to change the assignment they have received. \n\tIt seems to us incontestable that our QS$$0 common QE$$0 happiness, above all that of women, requires that they never aspire to the exercise of political rights and functions. Here we must seek their interests in the wishes of nature. QS$$2OS$$2 Is it not apparent, that their delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon them to gentle occupations and the cares of the home? QE$$2OE$$2 QS$$2OS$$3 And is it not evident that the great conserving principle of Societies, which makes the division of powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and revealed by nature itself, when it divided the functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a manner? QE$$2OE$$3 This is sufficient; we need not invoke principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us not make rivals of life\u2019s companions. You must, you truly must allow the persistence of a union that no interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand that the good of all demands this of you. Passage2 QS$$6OS$$0 Contending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue; QE$$6OE$$0 for QS$$6OS$$1 truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. QE$$6OE$$1 And how can woman be expected to co-operate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her QS$$4 reason QE$$4 till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations. . . . \n\tConsider, sir, dispassionately, these observations\u2014for a glimpse of this truth seemed to QS$$7 open before you when you observed, \u201cthat to see one half of the human race excluded by the other from all participation of government, was a political phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it was impossible to explain.\u201d QS$$6OS$$2 If so, on what does your QE$$7 constitution rest? QE$$6OE$$2 If the abstract rights of man will bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same test: though a different opinion prevails in this country, built on the very arguments which you use to justify the oppression of woman\u2014prescription. QS$$6OS$$3 \n\tConsider\u2014I address you as a legislator\u2014 whether, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their own happiness, QE$$6OE$$3 it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness? Who made man the exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift of reason? \n\tIn this style, argue tyrants of every denomination, from the weak king to the weak father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason; yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force all women, by denying them civil and political rights, to remain immured in their families groping in the dark?",
