    "passage": "QS$$1OS$$0 In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of stimuli: pain and temperature. QE$$1OE$$0 QS$$1OS$$1 Sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. QE$$1OE$$1 Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but QS$$1OS$$2 blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock. QE$$1OE$$2 H\u00e5kan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues \u00c5ke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be QS$$2 active QE$$2 in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects\u2019 arms with their fingertips. QS$$5OS$$0 Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to QS$$3 capture QE$$3 its electrical impulses, the scientists were able to measure how quickly\u2014or slowly\u2014the nerves fired. QE$$5OE$$0 QS$$5OS$$1 They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. QE$$5OE$$1 QS$$5OS$$2 The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will reach the brain about a half second later. QE$$5OE$$2 This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers\u2014about 1 meter/second\u2014confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. QS$$1OS$$3 (In contrast, fast- conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and 75 QE$$1OE$$3 m/s.) QS$$5OS$$3 \n\tThen, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. QE$$5OE$$3 They named these \u201clow-threshold\u201d nerves \u201cC-tactile,\u201d or CT, fibers, said Olausson, because of their \u201cexquisite sensitivity\u201d to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks. QS$$6 \n\tBut why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. QE$$6 Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found \n\tonly in hairy human skin\u2014such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers. \n\tAlthough microneurography can give information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the arm, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation? QS$$8 \n\tTo address the question, Olausson\u2019s group sought out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.\u2019s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated fibers were intact. QE$$8 \n\tUpon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2\u201310 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing. \n\tOlausson used functional MRI studies to examine which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.\u2019s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers brushed G.L.\u2019s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensations.",
