    "passage": "We are told that it is not within the \u201cprovince of woman,\u201d to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a QS$$2 \u201cpolitical question,\u201d QE$$2 and we are \u201cstepping out of our sphere,\u201d when we take part in its discussion. It is not true that it is merely a political question, it is likewise a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of religion; a question which, while it involves considerations of immense importance to the welfare and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into the home-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of our fellow beings. Whether the laborer shall receive the reward of his labor, or be driven daily to unrequited toil\u2014whether he shall walk erect in the dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckoned among the beasts which perish\u2014whether his bones and sinews shall be his own, or another\u2019s\u2014whether his child shall receive the protection of its natural guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the estate, to be disposed of as the caprice or interest of the master may dictate\u2014. . . these considerations are all involved in the question of liberty or slavery. \n\tAnd is a subject comprehending interests of such magnitude, merely a \u201cpolitical question,\u201d and one in which woman \u201ccan take no part without losing something of the modesty and gentleness which are her most appropriate ornaments\u201d? QS$$5OS$$0 May not the \u201cornament of a meek and quiet spirit\u201d exist with an upright mind and enlightened intellect, and must woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart is open to the claims of humanity, or less modest because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their rescue? QE$$5OE$$0 \n\tBy the Constitution of the United States, the whole physical power of the North is pledged for the suppression of domestic insurrections, and should the slaves, maddened by oppression, endeavor to shake off the yoke of the taskmaster, the men of the North are bound to make common cause with the QS$$7 tyrant, QE$$7 and put down, at the point of the bayonet, every effort on the part of the slave, for the attainment of his freedom. QS$$5OS$$1 And when the father, husband, son, and brother shall have left their homes to mingle in the unholy warfare, \u201cto become the executioners of their brethren, or to fall themselves \n\tby their hands,\u201d1 will the mother, wife, daughter, and sister feel that they have no interest in this subject? QE$$5OE$$1 QS$$10OS$$0 Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate, and their habitations the abodes of wretchedness? QS$$5OS$$2 QE$$10OE$$0 Surely this consideration is of itself sufficient to arouse the QS$$8 slumbering QE$$8 energies of woman, for the overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay in ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; QE$$5OE$$2 and she will not be deterred from the performance of her duty to herself, her family, and her country, by the cry of political question. \n\tBut admitting it to be a political question, have we no interest in the welfare of our country? QS$$10OS$$1 May we not permit a thought to stray beyond the narrow limits of our own family circle, and of the present hour? QE$$10OE$$1 May we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of our countrymen, nor utter a word of remonstrance against the unjust laws that are crushing them to the earth? Must we witness \u201cthe headlong rage or heedless folly,\u201d with which our nation is rushing onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its downward course? QS$$10OS$$2 Shall we silently behold the land which we love with all the heart-warm affection of children, rendered a hissing and a reproach throughout the world, by this system which is already tolling the death-bell of her decease among the nations? QE$$10OE$$2 QS$$10OS$$3 No: the events of the last two years have cast their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we cannot remain inactive. QS$$5OS$$3 QE$$10OE$$3 Our country is as dear to us as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely our hearts cling to \u201cour altars and our homes,\u201d the more fervent are our aspirations that every inhabitant of our land may be protected in his fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; QE$$5OE$$3 that the foot of the QS$$7 tyrant QE$$7 may no longer invade the domestic sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our course, then, still be onward! 1 A quotation from the Declaration of Independence",
